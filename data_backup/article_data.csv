description,"Tight liquidity, increased lending rates, poor buyer sentiments and lack of new model launches impacted sales during December"
content,"NoneTight liquidity, increased lending rates, poor buyer sentiment and lack of new model launches impacted sales during December. This is despite a steady decline in fuel rates and unusually high discounts offered by all automakers and their dealers to get rid of inventory before entering 2019.Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, reported just one percent rise in domestic sales during the month at 119,804 units as compared to 118,560 units clocked in the same month last year.Maruti’s growth was due to the continued demand for its utility vehicles such as Brezza and Ertiga and the Omni and Eeco van. Without these the Delhi-based company reported a fall of 4.7 percent in sales.The effects of the withdrawal of Wagon R to make room for the new model due on January 23 along with softness in demand for the segment comprising Swift, Baleno, Ignis and Dzire hit overall passenger car sales.During the last week of December Maruti Suzuki had undertaken the usual maintenance shutdown at its factories which also resulted in reduced supplies to dealers. “Sales during December will be on the lower side because we have lower inventories with dealers before they start accepting fresh stock in January,” RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki had said to Moneycontrol in December.India’s second largest car maker Hyundai reported 4.8 percent growth in volumes during December to 42,093 units. The Korean brand’s sales growth was largely aided by added volumes from the Santro, which was launched in October.The ‘sunshine’ car broke into India’s top ten best-selling cars list in November. The hatchback is believed to have garnered bookings of more than 45,000 units, giving Hyundai a stock-out for 3-4 months.But utility vehicle specialist Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) felt the heat in December with sales declining 3 percent. The Mumbai-based maker of Scorpio and Bolero sold 15,091 units of passenger vehicles during December as against 15,543 units sold in the same month last year.Rajan Wadhera, President, Automotive Sector, M&M said, “In the domestic market, challenges relating to tight liquidity and low buying sentiment continue the de-growth for December. We hope to see good performance in Q4, owing to the anticipated rural demand because of the harvesting season and the launch of our new XUV300 in February 2019.""After consistently beating growth of every large volume player in previous months Tata Motors said its sales growth in the domestic market stood at one percent in December. The company sold 14,260 units as against 14,180 units sold in the same month last year.Japanese auto giant Toyota Monday said it had clocked 10 percent growth during December to 11,830 units as against 10,793 units sold in the same month last year."

On Jan 1, 2018, the Indian rupee was at 63.68 a dollar.The top 10 funds in the IT category have given phenomenal returns, ranging from 11 percent to 20 percent, in a year.Another category that emerged among the top 10 schemes, were exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.In the year gone by, the worst of the lot were infrastructure, smallcap and midcap funds.  The worst hit scheme was HSBC Infra Equity Fund that delivered negative 34 percent average returns. This was followed by Sundaram LT Micro Cap Tax Advantage Fund that gave 29.5 percent average returns during the period under review.Infra funds underperformed in tandem with the disappointing performance of the infrastructure sector which is facing liquidity and funding crunch.None"

title,It's marathon season: 7 things to carry with you for that perfect race
datetime,2019-01-01 16:21:00+00:00
description,This is the race kit that you should carry with you for your marathon.
content,"You may have run many marathons or maybe this is your first. But most runners will feel a little nervous before their long run. Has the training been enough? Will the alarm go off on time? One of the ways to ensure you have a good run is to be well geared-up for the run.Here are a few things you need to check and carry for your marathon:For a runner, it is important to have comfortable running clothes that fit the body. No one loves to adjust their running shorts or roll up their sleeves frequently during the run. Wear dry fit clothes that absorb sweat and do not cause itches or rashes.This is perhaps your most important gear. The surface you will be running on, especially in cities like Mumbai, can often be unpredictable. You might encounter a wet surface. Now imagine not having running shoes with a good grip? You don’t want your run to end in a fall, do you? Perfectly fitting running shoes with good grip can make your run much easier.Pro tip: Do not buy shoes a day before the run. Make sure you try the shoes and test it with a short run a few days before the marathon.Most registrations for marathons today are done online and you do not need to carry a printout of it. What you do need to carry is an identity proof to get yourself ticked at the registration counter. Carrying a waist bag or a pouch will come in handy during the marathon. You can carry your ID, a towel, basic first-aid kit in the pouch. Remember, do not pack it with unnecessary items and make the pouch heavy.If you are attempting a long marathon, chances are you will be running in the sun. Applying sunscreen will prevent any sunburn or rashes. Also, wear sunglasses and a cap. You don’t want the light to blind you during the run, right?Since you are running, it is a good idea to keep a track of the calories you’ve burned. Get a good fitness band that is functional and accurate, and can give you details like the time you took to finish the marathon, the calories burned, your heart rate among other things.6. Earphones and a good playlistMusic has the power to motivate you. Make a playlist before the race because you do not want to keep stopping and changing tracks during the race. Include good cardio music or even your favourite songs. Connect those functional earphones to your smartphone/ mp3 player and you are good to go.A peaceful mind and positive attitude will help you focus while running the marathon. Get a good night’s sleep to feel fresh for the race."

title,Identifying multibaggers: How to pick stocks that can double your wealth
datetime,2019-01-03 14:26:00+00:00
description,"Multibagger stocks exhibit high profitability driven profit growth. So, first criteria always is to look for stocks where you could see high earnings growth in next 2-3 years, said an expert"
content,"""When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favourite holding period is forever."" - Warren BuffettA simple yet powerful advice, especially when one wants to pick stocks that could turn multibaggers in future.Multibaggers, as the name suggests, are the stocks that could generate returns in triple digits or more. These are usually high growth stocks. They might not give explosive returns initially, but hold the potential to be a big mover in long term.Management pedigree, as well as patience, are perhaps the most important points of any investor who is looking at stocks that could more than double his/her wealth not just once but consistently.2018 failed to cheer investors as only 5 stocks, and that too from the smallcap index, more than doubled investor wealth as compared to 167 stocks from the smallcap index in 2017.In 2018, the number of multibaggers dropped due to high valuations. The S&P BSE Smallcap index dropped 23 percent while the S&P BSE Midcap index fell about 13 percent.So how can one identify a multibagger? Well, it is one of the toughest questions to answer but there are simple rules which can help investors pick right stocks that hold the potential to more than double investor wealth in a consistent manner.Usually, we would find more stocks turning multibaggers from the small or the mid-cap space as compared to largecaps because these are high growth companies but at the same time these companies carry high risk, caution experts.“Multibagger stocks exhibit high profitability driven profit growth. So, first criteria always is to look for stocks where you could see high earnings growth in next 2-3 years. As price is multiple of earnings and valuations and valuation multiple growth happens if the profitability of the enterprise is improving,” Vineeta Sharma, HOR at Narnolia Financial Advisors told Moneycontrol.“Improvement in profitability ratios like ROE, ROCE, free cash flows are improving. This, in turn, happens when either margin or capital efficiency is improving. Also, one should check hygiene factors like corporate governance issues, etc. to avoid disruptive price moves,” she said.However, there are certain misconceptions about picking multibaggers. Some investors think that stocks which are trading at their 52-week low hold potential to give multi-fold returns as and when the market reverses the trend.Well, that might not be the case if we are gunning for stocks which could deliver consistent performance. However, if the market crashes, that’s the time when long-term investors should pick stocks which hold the potential to give steady returns.Apart from that, companies which are showing signs of a turnaround also qualify as part of the list which holds the potential to give multibagger returns, suggest experts.“We believe that 2019 is unlikely to be a year where there will be many multibaggers. Mid and Smallcaps tend to outperform when they are at a significant discount (at least 20%) to large-cap valuations, whereas they are at par now,” Vivek Ranjan Misra- Head of Fundamental Research at Karvy Stock Broking told Moneycontrol.“In the medium-term, mutibaggers will be largely turnaround cases. There are many companies where the financial performance is not good, but are able to turn around their financial performance,” he said.Mishra further added that these would be companies with low profitability and low growth in the recent past, but have potential to significantly benefit from a pickup in economic activity, in this context, it is important to mention that we expect a pickup in the investment cycle and would look for stocks geared to this theme.Market corrections offer opportunity:Smart investment strategy is ‘buy on bad news’.All major corrections were great buying opportunities. “Investors who bought “when there was blood on the streets” laughed all the way to the bank when calm returned to the market. Of course, it is difficult to catch the bottom of the market,” VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.“It is enough to buy when the market stabilizes following the crash and wait with a lot of patience,” he said. As Thomas Phelps said,” to make money in stocks you should have the vision to see, the courage to buy and the patience to hold.”The market tends to overreact and this overreaction provides buying opportunities. Take a look at the crashes and rebounds in the Indian stock market during the last 25 years."

title,6 tips for NRIs to get financial plans for 2019 in order
datetime,2019-01-01 18:06:00+00:00
description,"One NRE savings account, one NRO savings account and one demat account in case you still hold shares from when you were resident, are typically enough for most NRIs."
content,"Vishal DhawanFrom years of dealing with non-resident Indian (NRI) clients, I have learnt that an India visit tends to become an integral part of the lives for most NRIs. They come down to meet friends and family in the last quarter, or the first quarter of the year. Whilst a year-end visit is a great time to unwind and pick up on old conversations from where the last one left off, it is also a good idea to use it to review finances.We invariably find that personal financial matters tend to fall into the important-but-not-urgent category of things to do for most people, including for many NRIs visiting India for a short period. Make 2019 different by doing the following:Consolidate financial accountsWe come across multiple cases where families are holding bank accounts/demat accounts/mutual fund investments as a resident, even years after they have given up their residency status. This is not permitted, as the law requires NRIs to have all accounts converted to non-resident status.It is also a good idea to consolidate all accounts so that it is far easier to manage. A non-resident external (NRE) savings account, a non-resident ordinary (NRO) savings account and a demat account in case you still hold shares from when you were a resident are typically enough for most NRIs. If you wish to continue investing in India, open a portfolio investment scheme (PIS) account as well.NoneThe fact that the Indian tax year (April to March) is different from the tax year in many other parts of the globe (typically the calendar year) is a challenge that NRIs need to deal with.While India-generated income is taxable in India, in certain cases, where there is a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), it is possible to set off taxes paid in one geography against taxes due in another.As governments world over focus on tax collections more closely, it is critical that taxes are in order in both the country that you reside in, as well as in India. It may be a good idea to consider using the services of a tax advisor with cross border expertise, who understands taxes in both geographies, so that tax planning is well taken care of.Get a health coverA large number of NRIs wish to come back to India post retirement. They also have global health covers in place already, provided by their employers. Unfortunately, these covers will not be in place when they retire and it is therefore critical to ensure that a comprehensive independent health cover is put into place for the family rightaway.Whilst it is tempting to postpone an insurance expense in the presence of a global coverage, you need to remember that you may not be insurable due to pre-existing illnesses when you actually want this cover. You may therefore need to buy this health cover in advance to protect you against that risk.Have a 'global' financial plan...A high-quality financial plan that integrates the financial goals that you have for you and your family, as well as your global assets, investments, loans, income and expenses, will enable you to better align your current and future savings to the needs of your family’s dreams.This tends to be more complex for NRIs who are not sure whether they will return back to India or will continue to live overseas. If you are not sure about your final destination for retirement, it is best to create two versions of your financial plan, and then ensure that your investment strategy retains flexibility to deal with either of these two scenarios....An integrated investment strategy...Over the last few years, the correlations between financial markets have increased significantly, and thus investment portfolios that are not integrated globally could have significant volatility as investments in India and globally move in tandem.It is therefore critical for investment strategies to be designed in a manner wherein there is a global asset allocation strategy in place that aligns with your global financial plan.In case there is a need to rebalance due to a significantly overweight position in one asset class -- for example, equities held in India and globally, as both have done very well over the last few years -- please do so....And a global succession planSince assets could be held across multiple geographies, it is critical that wills and other succession planning tools are used well, so that in the unfortunate situation of something happening to you, your family can get access to your wealth easily.In case you are not visiting India, most of these things can be put into place remotely as well. Act decisively in 2019 to get your financial life in place."

title,From Vande Mataram to Bharat Mata ki Jai: A look at all the times BJP and Congress clashed over songs and slogans
datetime,2019-01-02 17:18:00+00:00
description,Both Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai have been dragged into political controversies for years. Here's a look at some of them
content,"Moneycontrol News The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have been locked in a battle of words and ideologies yet again after the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh announced on January 1 that it was not compulsory to sing 'Vande Mataram' in the Secretariat on the first day of every month, as has been the practice.Reacting to the decision, former MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said ""the BJP government had decided to start weekly cabinet meetings with it and it will be sung on the 1st day of every month"". Chouhan told news agency ANI that the song ""is a mantra that instills a sense of patriotism"".""I demand Congress to reintroduce this and if they don’t do it, I’ll sing Vande Mataram with patriots at Vallabh Bhavan on the premises on January 6,"" Chouhan said.This is not the first time that the Congress and BJP have clashed over the national song. In June last year, BJP National President Amit Shah had said during a lecture that the Congress had communalised Vande Mataram.Shah had said the song symbolises ""geo-cultural nationalism of our country"" and that it should not be ""treated as a song related to any religion or against someone"".""The Congress had made the same mistake by labelling it with a religious colour,"" Shah said, adding that the Congress had made the song the national song but only the first two stanzas were sung to appease a particular community.In 2017, the two parties had again clashed over the song in Uttarakhand when the state Congress had declared that it would not be singing the song at the party's official programmes for one month. The decision was taken after a minister in Uttarakhand's BJP government had said that those who want to reside in the state will have to sing the national song.Vande Mataram has also featured in a number of TV debates, sometimes causing embarrassment to the BJP. For instance, BJP spokesperson Navin Singh had, in 2017, sung the song wrongly on national television while challenging an opponent to sing it during a debate.During another debate, Minister of State for Minority Welfare, Baldev Singh Aulakh, too, had refused to sing the song on national television while insisting that the song be made mandatory in all schools across the country.Much like the national song, a slogan hailing the 'Bharat Mata'— 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'— has also been a topic of contention for both the parties.NoneCalling it a 'fatwa' against him, Modi had responded by saying he will raise the slogan 10 times in front of lakhs of people.The slogan became a topic of heated discussion three years ago during the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) episode when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat had said that the new generation needs to be taught to chant slogans hailing mother India."

Ghosn was charged for underreporting his income by approximately $44 million -- while he was Nissan -- over several years. If found guilty Ghosn, who is credited with Nissan's turnaround, could face a 10-year prison sentence.M&M, Ford sign MOUMahindra & Mahindra and Ford Motor Company signed agreements to jointly develop two SUVs, share engines, develop a small electric vehicle and share retail footprint to boost market reach in India. M&M is under pressure from competition as it has lost some market share, while Ford has been a fringe player despite more than two decades of operation in India.Companies give auto expo a missAt least 30 automotive brands gave the biennial India Auto Expo held in February a miss. Bajaj Auto, Harley-Davidson, Royal Enfield, Jaguar Land Rover, Eicher Motors, Ford and the entire Volkswagen Group decided to stay clear of the event citing high costs and negligible returns.Customs duty hike (luxury cars)The 2018 budget brought about a 5 percentage point hike in customs duty on knocked down kits imported into India raising it to 15 percent from 10 percent earlier. Companies like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover, Harley-Davidson, Triumph who have assembly plants in India were impacted by this.India overtakes UK marketAutomotive sales in India surged the second fastest in the world in 2017, with total numbers trumping developed markets like UK and France and coming within striking distance of Germany. Closing the last calendar year at 3.61 million units with a growth of 8.8 percent, India’s domestic automobile sales were the fifth highest in the world behind China (25.8 million), the US (17.23 million), Japan (5.16 million) and Germany (3.71 million). Auto sales in the UK were at 2.9 million units, and in France were at 2.54 million units.NoneNonePrices of all class of vehicles, which will be upgraded to Bharat Stage VI emission standard will witness a significant increase in 2020 with the switchover. Consumers are thus expected to buy existing BS-IV grade vehicles to beat the hike. The steepest increase will be for commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) followed by diesel cars and SUVs. Companies are expected to ramp up output to meet the added demand.All cars to have airbags, reverse parking sensor              India has the highest road mortality rate in the world.

title,Royal Enfield sales drop as Jawa stops the Bullet's juggernaut
datetime,2019-01-03 15:25:00+00:00
description,"Royal Enfield posted a 14% sales drop in December 2018, its sharpest slowdown since June 2011 "
content,"None Royal Enfield reported a drop of 14 percent in December 2018 in domestic sales, the sharpest drop since June 2011 when the leisure bike brand posted 31 percent drop in domestic volumes. Sales for Royal Enfield stood at 56,026 units in December against 65,367 units clocked in the year-ago period.NoneM&M said that bookings had to be halted as there is a stock-out situation at its factory in Madhya Pradesh. Deliveries of Jawa models from the recently closed lot of bookings will commence in March and will continue till September. This was the first in more than eight years that bookings of a model had to be halted due to demand surge.Both Jawa and Royal Enfield models use the same retro styling-DNA inspired by motorcycles sold in the 1960s and 1970s. While the Jawas are powered by a single cylinder 300cc engine that produces peak power of 27hp the Royal Enfield Classic is powered by a 350cc single cylinder engine generating 20hp of peak power.The surge in demand for the Jawas has comes despite their higher prices tags compared to the Classic 350. While the Royal Enfield Classic 350 is priced at Rs 1.4 lakh the Jawa Forty-Two is priced Rs 1.55 lakh (both prices ex-showroom, Delhi).For Royal Enfield, FY19 has been low-key. The brand clocked a growth of just six percent in domestic sales during the April-December period as against 21 percent growth clocked in the same period last year.Hit by some fatigue in demand for its traditional models such as the Classic 350 (its largest-selling model) and underperformance of new models such as the Himalayan and Continental GT 500, hit Royal Enfield hard this year even though no company has launched any competing model in the same category and price band.From a high, industry beating double digit growths in earlier years, Royal Enfield’s growth at nine percent during April-November period was below that of the industry which grew by 11 percent during the same year.Royal Enfield launched two bikes in November, Interceptor and Continental GT, both of which are priced above Rs 2.5 lakh. Senior executives of Eicher Motors say the company is not expecting ‘huge numbers’ from the two models given their steeper price tags."

content,"NoneThe under-construction ground station of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is intended to help the Himalayan state take advantage of the South Asia Satellite, but it would also help the country to counter a similar facility of China in the region, the report has suggested.China has set up an advanced satellite tracking centre and astronomical observatory about 125 kilometres from the Line of Actual Control, the official border between India and China at Ngari in the Tibet Autonomous Region. According to the report, the centre is so advanced that apart from tracking Indian satellites, it can also ""blind"" them.The development of the ground station is believed to have significant ramifications, especially after the Doklam stand-off. In 2017, China had attempted to construct a road at a tri-junction between India, China, and Bhutan, which had led to a 72-day face-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army at Doklam."

title,'#AapkeHisaabSe': HDFC Bank’s car loan repayment scheme. Worth it or a gimmick?
datetime,2019-01-03 11:25:00+00:00
description,"The drawback of a step-up scheme is that you may end up taking a higher EMI commitment based on future income, which is uncertain."
content,"NoneBut does it benefit the customer? Read on to know.What is the scheme all about?NoneIn the step-up EMI scheme, the EMI increases with time, unlike the standard EMI scheme where it remains constant through the tenure of the loan. For instance, the customer may choose to increase the EMI by 11 percent every year through the tenure.In the balloon repayment scheme, a certain percentage of the loan can be repaid as EMI (calculated based on eligibility) while the balance can be paid at the end of the loan tenure. So unlike the step-up repayment scheme where the EMI gradually increases, a customer can pay an equal EMI for a certain chosen amount and the balance as a bulk amount in the last instalment. For example, a customer may decide to repay 70 percent of the car loan as equal EMIs over the loan tenure and the remaining 30 percent as a bullet repayment at the end of the tenure.In both the repayment options, the eligibility is calculated based on a combination of current income and expected growth in income.NoneNoneUnder the step-up scheme, EMI can be up to 24 percent lower in the first three years before it gradually starts increasing. Balloon repayment allows up to 30 percent lower EMIs throughout the tenure and a larger lump sum amount at the end of the term.Step-up scheme allows borrowers to buy the car of their choice without being constrained by their existing eligibility for the required loan amount. Whereas, the balloon repayment scheme is suitable for borrowers who want to keep their monthly expenses low and are certain of their ability to have sufficient savings to repay the last instalment of the loan.NoneThe drawback of the step-up scheme is that you may end up taking a higher EMI commitment based on future income that remains uncertain. In case the career or income graph doesn’t progress as expected it may lead to undue financial stress at a later stage. According to Rachit Chawla, Founder and CEO of lending and investment advisory platform Finway, “You may also land into a bad credit score in case of failure in repayment in this scheme.”Gaurav Gupta, Co-founder and CEO of online aggregator of financial products and services MyLoanCare.in said, “The caveat in balloon repayment scheme is that these loans turn out to be costlier as you keep paying interest on a significant loan amount outstanding till the end of the tenure.”Let’s look at the repayment schedule for a borrower under the three schemes i.e. standard, step-up and balloon repayment. Let's assume a customer buys a car with a loan of Rs 10 lakh at an interest rate of 9 percent for a tenure of seven years.A back of the envelope calculation shows under the standard repayment scheme the interest outgo will be Rs 3.51 lakh over the loan tenure at EMI of Rs 16,089 for seven years. But, in the case of step-up repayment scheme assuming lower EMI of Rs 10,000 in the first 2 years and a 21 percent increase after 2 years to Rs 19,399, the customer ends up paying 15 percent higher interest than that in the standard car loan scheme over the loan tenure.Similarly, in the case of a balloon repayment scheme that starts with 27 percent lower EMI (i.e. Rs 12,653) compare to the standard scheme, the customer will end up paying 32 percent higher interest than that in the standard car loan scheme over the loan tenure.NoneNone“Young borrowers keen to buy a car using the step-up or balloon repayment schemes need to evaluate their loan eligibility, expected future income as well as understand the terms and conditions thoroughly of the loan scheme and compare them with standard car loan scheme before taking a decision,” said Gupta.“This car loan feature is not a new feature from the bank. There are several banks giving the option to step up the EMIs on outstanding loan but they don’t advertise. It’s recommended as your income increases, make part payments towards the car loan and bring down your long-term interest costs,” said Adhil Shetty, CEO of an online aggregator of financial products BankBazaar.com.It’s important to note. Balloon repayment scheme is risky because cars are depreciating assets and they lose value over time. So, by the end of loan tenure, the customer is left with a car that’s worth significantly less than what was paid for it and has to pay off most of what was borrowed at end of the tenure (last installment to the bank as explained in the table above).It is advisable to avoid such step-up or balloon repayment options and remember the total interest outgo in these schemes works out to be higher than the standard schemes (refer to the table above) as the rate of repayment of the principal loan amount is slower vis-à-vis that of a standard car loan.Even in the case where an owner wants to sell the car during the loan tenure, he/she may have to pay some amount to the new buyer to cover the pending loan. For instance, under the balloon repayment scheme, the owner will almost certainly owe the bank more than the depreciated value of the car at the time of selling since the last leg of the loan forms the biggest chunk."

description,"The recent IIFL Wealth-Wealth X report says that HNIs reckon the best place to book returns right now is investment funds, followed by equities and fixed income"
content,"It is not just retail investors who put their hard earned money in mutual funds, HNIs or high net worth individuals also prefer investment funds including mutual funds and ETFs over direct equities, AIFs, property and primary business.The recent IIFL Wealth-Wealth X report reveals HNIs reckon the best place to book returns right now is investment funds, followed by equities and fixed income.Investment funds make up one-third of the total assets held by the super wealthy and 84 percent of HNIs hold at least some of their fortune in these funds. Interestingly, one in five HNIs holds over half their wealth in investment funds.Direct equity, cash and fixed income followed investment funds and primary businesses. In terms of wealth allocation, the report shows 16 percent of wealth is held in equities and 13 percent in fixed income. Cash deposits account for 6 percent.In addition, 48 percent of HNIs want to increase their exposure to mutual funds over the next year, according to the report.Moneycontrol spoke exclusively with London-based David Barks, Director, Wealth-X Custom Research who was in India to launch IIFL Wealth Index 2018 report.He shared key insights from the report with Moneycontrol.Q: The report says affluent Indians and their wealth is expected to rise by 87 percent over the next 5 years. Are you seeing this kind of growth in any other region of the world?NoneIndia's HNI growth of 40 percent over the past five years has eclipsed that of its rivals in economies elsewhere in the world, placing India in a league of its own. By comparison, the global HNI population and its wealth grew by 3.2 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, over the same period. India is ranked fourth in the world for the number of newly wealthy individuals joining the ranks of the rich, coming in behind economic behemoths like the US, Japan, and China but ahead of European powerhouse Germany.Q: Key factors that you believe have perpetuated this growth?NoneIndia’s economy is expected to grow at a fast clip as various government initiative with respect to the passing of the GST Bill, the Bankruptcy Code and demonetisation come to bear fruit and add to the growth in the economy. In its biannual publication, India Development Update, the World Bank said India’s GDP growth is projected to reach 6.7 percent in 2017-18 and accelerate to 7.3 percent and 7.5 percent in 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively.This is in comparison with the Chinese economy growing at a projected rate of 6.3 percent in 2019. This strong economic growth is likely to underpin the wealth creation of India’s HNW elite.Q: What role will technology play in this growth?NoneQ: Would you like to briefly discuss the key findings of the report?NoneBut the very top tier of wealth-holders, the ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs), are more heavily invested in their own businesses, usually within India. Another interesting theme that became evident was that money is not the sole motivator for this demographic. They are also getting increasingly inclined towards social impact investing which they view as being on par with philanthropy. There is a deep focus on social impact and how wealth can be used for driving social causes in the country. International property and luxury goods continue to form a part of their investment portfolio.Q: Any surprising trends that were revealed by this research?NoneQ: Impact on the wealth management industry?"

description,This is the verbatim transcript of Jet Airways management call with analysts.
content,"This is the verbatim transcript of Jet Airways management call with analysts.NoneNoneOn the cost side we continued to see our cost savings initiatives bearing fruit. It is noteworthy that our CASK including fuel was almost flat at Rs.3.09 against Rs.3.07 in Q2 FY2018.This is despite the significant depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar across the comparable period. Excluding the adverse impact of exchange rates, our non-fuel CASK was, in fact, Rs.2.94, which is about 4.2 points lower compared to the same period last year. Compared to first quarter of FY2019, the non-fuel CASK in this quarter was lower by 2.4%.This is testimony to the fact that our cost reduction initiatives are bearing fruit, and we are on track to meet the cost reduction targets, which we have set for ourselves. Excluding foreign exchange, the current quarter's nonfuel CASK is a 9% lower than the nonfuel CASK of fiscal year 2017.To remind everyone on the call, this is in line with the target we communicated late last year to reduce our nonfuel CASK by 12% to 15% compared to FY2017 in the succeeding 10 to 12 quarters. On the network front, the Airline continues to evaluate environmental factors and economic performance and is undergoing a comprehensive update of its network along with products and services offered. The strategy includes concentration of capacity, enhancing frequency density and hub connectivity to better serve our corporate customers, which contribute to more than 45% of our revenue. The measures will include rationalization of our operations on uneconomic routes and the redeployment of these assets to more productive and economically efficient international, as well as domestic sectors, closely aligning capacity with the demand characteristics of specific markets. Effective 29 August 2019 we have introduced 28 new flights in our domestic network, which include industry first flights connecting Indore with Jodhpur and Vadodara and additional frequencies on Mumbai to Guwahati. To complement the changes in our network, we are also implementing new revenue management strategies that help us cope with a difficult fare environment. The implementation of these strategies is going well, and we expect to see this bear fruit in our reported RASK performance over the coming quarters. We are in a dynamic business, which is ever evolving to ensure that needs of all segments of our guests are met. To cater the needs of certain sections of our guests, we have come up with more flexible fare options on our domestic services. We have now unbundled fares in the Light and Deal categories of fare choices in the economy cabin for flights within India to allow customers to buy a meal. The revised offering on the fare choices will now allow guests to enjoy more value for money by letting them choose a travel plan based on their preference, travel requirements and budget. So to recap, we are successfully implementing transformational initiatives in the areas of operation reliability, cost, revenue and the customer experience.Now let us move to the results of the second quarter for fiscal year 2019. This quarter, we reported a loss of Rs.1261 Crores at a consolidated level. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange losses due to the depreciation rupee, the loss was Rs.823 Crores. Amit and Ravi will be taking you through the results in detail later during our call. Just some highlights though for now. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the capacity deployed in terms of ASKs increased by 7.3% over the same period last year to 15.3 billion ASKs. We recorded 2.2% traffic growth in this quarter, with a number of passengers carried increasing to 7.45 million over the same period last year.We reported a RASK of RS. 4.16 for Q2 FY2019, which is practically flat compared to Q2 of FY2018, despite a stage length increase of 9.6%. We improved the load factor by 2.5 points, which was offset by the lower fare regime dominating the Indian aviation markets these days. Fuel prices have seen a sharp increase with Brent price being higher by 51%, at $75 per barrel in Q2 FY2019, compared to $50 per barrel in the same period last year. As a result, the fuel CASK in Q2 was 44% higher as compared to Q2 of FY'18. This led to our overall CASK increasing to Rs.4.75 in Q2 FY2019 as compared to Rs.4.22 in FY2018. We are glad to share that our first ever-nonstop service between Mumbai and Manchester has started from November 5, and we are seeing an encouraging response from our guests. We have also expanded our code share partnerships with Bangkok Airways, Malaysian Airlines, for seamless connectivity of our passengers to and from points in India and the overseas and have also expanded the scope of code share agreements with Korean air on our Bengaluru to Singapore service. We are already seeing fuel efficiencies in our 737 Max Aircraft. Along with extremely positive feedback from guests about the overall flight experience of the Max, we have so far inducted 5 out of the 11 Max aircraft scheduled to be delivered to us this financial year. Let me now request Amit to take you through the financial and operating highlights.NoneTurning to the current quarter and outlook. While the aviation market in India continues to be challenging, sales are showing little signs of improvement as we enter into the busiest quarter of the year. In the upcoming quarter, we would be adding 3 more B737 Max aircrafts, taking the total tally of the fuel-efficient aircraft to 8. As mentioned in earlier calls, we are strengthening our network with additional departures out the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities to connect to Metro cities in this effort we have connected Indore to 14 cities on our network.On the international front, we are introducing daily nonstop flights between Pune and Singapore, which will enable our guests to connect to more destinations beyond Singapore like Brisbane, Jakarta, Nadi to name a few. With overwhelming response to our existing services between Delhi and Singapore, we intend to start third frequency on this sector to cater to the demands of our guests. We have also started our fourth frequency, daily frequency between Delhi - Dubai to strengthen our network in the Gulf market. Let me now open the call to questions.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneBloomberg have talked about Tata?

description,So far US FDA inspectors believe contaminated compounds were unintentionally created through a chemical reaction. 
content,"A probable carcinogenic impurity found in the pill Valsartan, commonly prescribed medication to treat hypertension, is giving generic drug makers high blood pressure.NoneAurobindo pulled off the drugs voluntarily on USFDA's advice.NDEA is a substance that occurs naturally in certain foods, drinking water, air pollution, and industrial processes, and has been classified as a probable human carcinogen, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).So far the USFDA inspectors believed contaminated compounds were unintentionally created through a chemical reaction.""The agency continues to investigate and test all angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for the presence of NDEA and N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and is taking swift action when it identifies these impurities that are above interim acceptable daily intake levels,"" USFDA said in a statementThe latest recall is the third by Aurobindo in the US in last three months.NoneAurobindo manufactures Valsartan API and formulations in-house and maintained its route of synthesis is different, with chances of impurity almost nil.Along with US, drug regulators in Europe, Japan and Canada have increased scrutiny.""Companies marketing sartan medicines in the EU have been asked to test their products for these impurities. Additional testing is being carried out by EU laboratories,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said recently.The matter isn't ending at recalls, several class action lawsuits were filed against distributors and manufacturers of the drug in the US. In December last year, there were media reports of a class action lawsuit initiated against Aurobindo Pharma for selling contaminated Ibersartan.Aurobindo said it hasn't received notices of any class action lawsuit yet.China connectionThe global recall of valsartan medications began in summer last year when the USFDA and EU learned that the Valsartan API made by China’s Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals contained probable carcinogenic impurities NDEA and NDMA, in more than permissible limits.The detection of probable carcinogenic impurities in Valsartan APIs supplied by Zhejiang Huahai has now led to a widening of the net to include all other API makers making sartan APIs.Among the pharma players in India, Torrent was a customer of the Chinese company. Not anymore. Aurobindo, Hetero Labs and Mylan manufacture sartans. All of them are under scrutiny now.Analysts said the recalls may not have much monetary impact on the companies, as Valsartan drugs are low margin generics and their contribution for sales isn't that meaningful.""It's a short-term opportunity for Indian companies due to the shortage created by the recalls, we have seen Aurobindo Pharma in the second quarter made decent sales on the sartans,"" Amey Chalke, Pharma Analyst at HDFC Securities said.Chalke said that class action lawsuit may not be a huge threat, as these companies have been manufacturing the drug whose process has been approved by USFDA and this impurity is the outcome of the unintentional chemical reaction.Another analyst who tracks pharma on anonymity said companies will have to review their manufacturing process to ensure the impurity doesn't occur. Then they have to seek fresh approval from USFDA."

content,"There has been no decision recently regarding production of Rs 2,000 notes and its printing is planned as per projected requirement, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said.Printing of notes is planned as per the projected requirement. We have more than adequate notes of Rs 2000 in the system with over 35% of notes by value in circulation being of Rs 2000. There has been no decision regarding 2000 rupee note production recently.NoneNoneThe Rs 2,000 note, along with the new Rs 500 note, was introduced in November 2016 to replace the demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes and to deal with the acute currency shortage.The report also said that the decision also comes amid suspicion that the Rs 2,000 note is being used for money laundering, hoarding and tax evasion. However, the cut in circulation doesn't translate into the note being deemed invalid.Opposition parties had criticised the introduction of these notes as a higher denomination note would only make it easier for people to hoard money.The critics also included bankers like Uday Kotak (MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank) who questioned the government’s move to bring in Rs 2,000 notes to replace Rs 1,000 notes.In April 2018, there was an acute shortage of cash. The government suspected that the cash may have been hoarded ahead of state elections and in the aftermath of the Nirav Modi scam.During the same period, the income tax department seized massive amounts of Rs 2,000 notes.There have been indications of phasing out the Rs 2,000 note. The RBI annual report in August 2018 stated that only 7.8 crore notes of Rs 2,000 denomination were added in 2017-18, bringing the total to 336.3 crore Rs 2,000 notes in circulation as of March 2018.

title,5 trends that will redefine retail industry in 2019
datetime,2019-01-03 17:24:00+00:00
description,"he driving purpose behind today’s retail trends is to elevate the consumer-retailer relationship by increasing personalization, transforming customers into fans and boosting Customer Lifetime Value"
content,"The year 2018 witnessed major developments across all industries and verticals, including some of the most crucial turn of events in the retail industry in India.The year was certainly not the same for all—while the world’s largest athletic-gear maker Nike went on a consolidation spree in India to curtail losses, renowned brands like Adidas and Reebok shifted towards athleisure upon gauging its potential in the Indian market.From major acquisitions such as that of Flipkart by Walmart, and of Heritage Foods, Lee Cooper and UK-based Laura Ashley by Future Retail to international furniture giant IKEA opening its first store in India at Hyderabad—the retail industry has seen it all in 2018.In 2019, the market will be defined by emerging technologies that change the way consumers interact with their favourite brands, a shift in preferences, and the emergence of new battle lines for e-commerce.As we move towards 2019, here are some of the key developments that have been predicted to reshape the retail industry:Trend 1: Experiential RetailExperiential retail draws the focus to a customer-centric approach where the customer is able to interact with product or brand rather than being a passive participant.As consumers choose to invest in experiences rather than products, retailers need to respond to meet the needs of their customers. Customers do not want to just walk into the shop, buy the product and leave because they could do this in the comfort of their own home.For instance: Slew of retailers provide a screen for customers to use where they can sign in and search their purchase history and bucket list, providing customer insight for the sales assistants.There is also a smart mirror so they can request different sizes, alternative products or even pay without leaving the dressing room. Their high tech advancements also give the customers the opportunity to customize and order shoes, with different styles and fabrics.Trend 2: Augmented Reality vs Virtual RealityRetailers are beginning to experiment with virtual commerce, which leverages virtual and augmented reality devices to create entirely new conveniences for tomorrow's consumers. Augmented reality (AR) is slightly different from virtual reality (VR) as it overlays holograms on top of the physical world around us. Experts have noted that by 2020, the retail industry is slated to be the top spending industry on AR and VR.For instance: IkEA launched a new VR experience that places shoppers in the middle of a shoppable, 3D kitchen.Moving away from the tenants of the traditional retail market, multi-channel retailing has gained increasing popularity. The aim is for the retailer to be available to the consumer on all devices. The most common device used by shoppers nowadays is their mobile phones.With online shopping available at the click of a button and features like product details, size guide and free shipping, it is imperative for retailers to move their businesses online.For instance: Future Retail owns brick and mortar stores, while they have also tied up with e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Myntra for selling its products. Future Retail also has a mobile app and Big Bazaar website for shopping.Trend 4: Hyper PersonalisationThe driving purpose behind today’s retail trends is to elevate the consumer-retailer relationship by increasing personalisation, transforming customers into fans and boosting Customer Lifetime Value.Imagine a store where 99 percent of the items are selected for a customer based on their history and preferences. A shoppable virtual fridge stocked with your favourite foods. A smart speaker that knows your order history and can order your usual coffee with a simple voice command. A store where the inventory, messaging, prices and sizes are dynamically changed for you. It will soon seem absurd that we ever wasted time shopping at stores not designed for us.For instance: Stitch Fix is an online retailer that offers customers access to personal stylists who help them find clothing based on their sartorial tastes. The hand-selected pieces are shipped to their door and customers keep what they want and send back the rest. With the option to do this automatically or on demand, customers can buy what works best for their budget and their closet.Trend 5: Automated RetailLastly, the retail industry is slowly working towards creating a human interaction-free experience for the consumer. Moving rapidly towards automation on all fronts, many retailers have already adopted the cashier-less model – be it small merchants or large ones.Automated retail is now a broad area including everything from vending machines to unmanned kiosks to unattended grocery stores.For instance: BigBasket has launched BB Instant, as part of a broader strategy to increase the volume and frequency of orders on its platform.Bigbasket has placed physical kiosks containing grocery items and consumables in several apartment complexes.These are unmanned kiosks. Customers can place orders on the BigBasket app and when they pick up the order, it automatically bills the wallet."

title,Axle load norms behind dip in demand for new heavy trucks
datetime,2019-01-03 15:14:00+00:00
description,"Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles, especially in the cargo segment, saw a 22 percent fall for India’s top four truck and bus manufacturers in November-December"
content,"The new axle load norms approved by the government in the middle of last year has proved to be one of the main reasons behind the poor performance of commercial vehicles during the past few months.NoneSales of MHCV during November and December slumped to 51,702 units as against 66,357 units posted in the same period last year, as per data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).In July last year, the government had increased the permissible gross vehicle weight (GVW) of over 16 tonne heavy trucks by about 12-25 percent.The norms allows truck owners to increase load on the vehicle up to the new limit as prescribed by the government. The higher limit has in a way legalised overloading and given fleet owners the opportunity to sweat their existing assets more instead of purchasing new trucks.This is one of the major reasons why there has been sluggishness in demand for new trucks, besides other issues such as tightened credit lending norms, increased interest rates, liquidity issues with non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and higher diesel prices.Girish Wagh, President (CVBU), Tata Motors, said, “The axle load increase did lead to some demand uncertainties as existing vehicles were allowed to register for higher load. This created a doubt in the minds of fleet owners whether there was need to add fresh vehicles or sweat the existing lot. The end consumer, who have higher bargaining power, began to demand the benefit of increased axle load. As a result of all this, sentiment started to dip.”MHCV sales of Tata Motors fell 26 percent during the last two months to 21,299 units.On the other hand, sales of trucks in the sub-16 tonne segment, which comprises intermediate and light commercial vehicles, didn't suffer a similar fall in numbers.Tippers, where overloading is not possible, continued to post double-digit growth during the same period.“Every segment has its own way of responding to the situation. There was a directive given to the RTO (Regional Transport Office) that older vehicles can also be certified for the new load. Then a 37 tonne vehicle can be certified to carry 42 tonne. There was no need for truck owners to invest in new trucks if existing trucks can carry that extra load,” said a senior executive of Ashok Leyland.The Chennai-based company reported a 25 percent fall in MHCV sales to 20,013 units during November and December. Ashok Leyland is the second biggest manufacturer of MHCVs in India.NoneNone"

description,"Coming into 2019, you can expect KTM to offer four new motorcycles including the RC250, RC250, 390 Adventure and 790 Duke."
content,"KTM is a much-loved motorcycle brand in our country. It offers premium sport motorcycles at a fraction of the cost when compared to other motorcycle manufacturers that offer entry-level sport bikes in our country.For a long time, we had the 200 and 390 Dukes and the RC200 and RC390 motorcycles on offer. Then came the 250 Duke and the most recent addition to India's KTM stable was the 125 Duke.Now even though the 125 Duke is priced fairly steep considering its segment, it received a phenomenal response. Coming into 2019, you can expect KTM to offer four new motorcycles in India and this has us all excited.KTM RC250NoneThe RC250 may already be manufactured in India, but all of it is exported. There is no official word out that the bike will be launched in India, but there was a test mule spotted a while ago.The RC250 is powered by the same 248.8cc single cylinder that powers the 250 Duke and churns out 30 PS of power and 24 Nm of torque. Mated to a 6-speed gearbox, the bike runs on the RC390's chassis and will go up against the likes of the Honda CBR 250R and the upcoming Suzuki Gixxer 250.2020 KTM RC 390NoneRecently spied testing in Europe, the RC390 will be a much-needed refresh. Back when the 390 Duke received its update, the RC390 only received some new decals and ride by wire throttle alongside a BS-IV compliant engine.The new bike is expected to get revised styling which means a new headlamp design, a tweaked rear side, and sharper lines all around. You can also expect the new full-colour TFT dash with Bluetooth for smartphone integration.KTM 390 Adventure The 390 Adventure is perhaps one of the most awaited motorcycles from KTM in India. It was expected to be unveiled at the 2018 EICMA show but we got the Adventure 790 instead.There was a test mule spotted earlier in India however and this points towards the 390 finally being pulled out of the woodwork. Built around the 390 Duke's 373.2cc engine, the bike will get a taller suspension, dual-purpose tyres and pure ADV styling.KTM 790 DukeNoneThe KTM 790 Duke will perhaps be KTM's most powerful bike in India yet. When launched, it will take on the likes of the Triumph Street Triple and the Kawasaki Z900."

datetime,2019-06-21 16:58:00+00:00
description,"Here's a list of car tyres which can suit your needs, and keep your car planted to the ground."
content,"NoneThe little piece of rubber which separates the tarmac from the rest of your car called a tyre plays a rather essential yet overlooked role in the safety, performance and basic functioning of your vehicle.A set of good, grippy tyres can drastically improve your ride quality. On the contrary, running on bad, damaged or generally degraded tyres can increase the risk of a crash or slide-out considerably.However, it is not easy to identify which tyre is best for your car, unless you know what you’re looking for. Keeping that in mind, here is a list of tyres which will give you a long, safe and satisfactory drive:Bridgestone TuranzaAn exclusively high-speed tyre, the Bridgestone Turanza is built to handle speeds, and it does the job well. Suitable for hatchbacks or middle power sedans, the Turanza offers an unparalleled tyre compound, tread grips and is one of the quietest tires on the street.Goodyear GT3A comfortable option for most sedans in India, the Goodyear GT3 offers a perfect blend of cushioning and grip. Priced at about Rs 5,300 a piece, the GT3 is a good option for people looking to compromise between safety and comfort.MRF ZVTSAn Indian brand famous for making grippy motorcycle tyres, the MRF ZVTS falls in the budget tyre range and can be opted for small to medium hatchbacks in India. It costs about Rs 2,600 a piece, which makes it a cheap yet reliable option.Michelin PrimacyMichelin has had a history of making championship winning, as well as life-saving tyres. Continuing with their legacy, Michelin has come up with the Primacy, a heavy-duty tyre built for the average Indian SUV. It offers a great mix of performance and safety, while also ensuring the rider stays comfortable. All that at a price of Rs 6,700 a piece.Apollo AmazersA somewhat economical option, Apollo tyres offer the best grip for the price they ask for. Apollo Amazers are best suited for Indian sedans, with prices starting from Rs 3,600 a piece.JK Tyre VectraAnother Indian brand, JK Tyre is a favourite choice for anyone looking for the most bang for their buck. Priced at just Rs 3,800 a piece, the JK Tyre Vectra is a rugged tyre for sedans and hatchbacks looking to do small daily runs, rather than munching miles on the highway.Yokohama Geolander ATThe Japanese manufacturer Yokohama does not settle for anything but the best. This is evident in its heavy-duty Geolandar AT tyre, which is made for strong, powerful SUVs, and can conquer any terrain with ease. Hence the AT in its name.Maxxis MA-P1The cheapest, most economical option for small cars, Maxxis MA-P1, is a Taiwanese tyre which is the best choice for anyone looking to save on their rubber massively. Priced at Rs 2,400 a piece, the MA-P1 is ideal for hatchbacks like Maruti Alto or Wagon RThis is a list of car tyres which can suit your needs, and keep your car planted to the ground. "

content,"For a motorcycle to stay on the road, an essential component is a tyre. With almost all the power of the engine being delivered to the rear wheel, it becomes vital for the front wheel not to lift, and the rear to not over spin.Apart from power figures and torque outputs, good tyres are essential to keep the bike right side up. Keeping that in mind, here is a list of tyre brands which can ensure a safe, fast and stable ride on your bike:1.

PirelliAnother internationally acclaimed tyre brand, Pirelli specialises in high quality, grippy tyres across segments. However, the only drawback is the tyre life, which is relatively low in comparison with others. It is because of their soft rubber compound which erodes quickly.3.

title,Transcript| Marico Limited Q2 FY 2019 Earnings Conference Call
datetime,2019-01-04 10:45:00+00:00
description,This is the verbatim transcript of Marico management call with analysts.
content,"This is the verbatim transcript of Marico management call with analysts.NoneI now hand the conference over to Mr. Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Thank you and over to you, Sir!NoneWe have the senior management of the company represented by Mr. Saugata Gupta, MD and CEO and Mr. Vivek Karve -- Chief Financial Officer.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that the Q&A session is only for the institutional investors and analysts and therefore, if there is anybody else who is not an institutional investor or an analyst but would still like to ask questions or seek clarifications, please directly reach out to Marico’s Investor Relations team.With that, I would like to hand over the call to the management for their opening comments.NoneHowever, there were some significant positive outcomes in this quarter. In the India business, robust Parachute volume growth of 8%; improvement in Saffola; continued traction in Male Grooming; Premium Hair Care and Foods along with a very strong innovation pipeline, appears positive.In Hair Oils, we had muted growth largely because of CSD. We are aspiring to push the Value-added Hair Oil volume growth to double-digits in the second-half.In the International business, we now believe that we have a steady growth momentum across key markets, with Vietnam finally getting back on track and Bangladesh & MENA continuing to show a predictable pattern of double-digit growth.Unless there are any macro headwinds, we continue to aspire for 8-10% volume growth in Indian business and a double-digit constant currency growth in the International business for this financial year.Let me now delve a little deep into the India business. We continue to do well in rural, modern trade and E-com, but we have to improve our performance in urban general trade and CSD, which have been relative underperformers.In the face of continued competitive intensity in price point packs in certain markets, we have continued to gain marginal share in Coconut Oil and held market share in Value Added Hair Oils. While we will continue to defend our market share at the lowest price points, we will simultaneously aggressively invest behind premium initiatives like Aloe Vera, Hair & Care and others to drive value share gain in the coming quarters.We are excited about our new product pipeline, like Nihar Extra Care Hair Fall Control Oil; Parachute Advanced Coconut Crème Oil; True Roots, which is a very revolutionary product, and some of the extensions in Set Wet and Livon. The offerings are much differentiated and we now believe that if we execute them well in the marketplace, we have critical mass in terms of a premium portfolio to aggressively drive premiumization in the next 2-3 years. This will also be aided by our focus on E-commerce and Modern trade in the medium-term. While there has been a partial solve for Saffola, we still have to get it back to double-digit growth and this will take some time.We are also preparing a stronger pipeline for Foods in the coming quarters besides increasing our portfolio in digital brands. Across the organization, there is a renewed focus on agility and OTIF execution, which is On Time and Full, which should aid growth in the coming quarters. With copra prices coming down, we will definitely invest a part of the gains into incremental advertising spend, while balancing margin gains and volume protection in any pricing actions in the coming quarters. As regards to International business, we are now at a point of getting into a steady momentum in all our key markets. We continue to diversify aggressively in Bangladesh, while we have building blocks in place in Vietnam/Southeast Asia. We have now delivered 4 straight quarters of steady double-digit growth in MENA. We are confident of delivering, therefore, double-digit constant currency growth in the coming quarters given the significant improvement in the organic growth capability across these markets.To conclude, we expect a steady and improving performance over the next few quarters with an increasingly better innovation track record. While there will be benefits in copra, we do have input cost pressures in the rest of the portfolio, and therefore, there will be only a partial impact on margin. Since, we would like to deploy a part of the gain towards increase the A&P, and maybe some towards pricing. The consumption scenario is currently stable, but we have to watch out for any macro trends like inflation and any impact of the sluggish September monsoon that could impact the rural growth agenda in some of our categories. Having said that, we believe now we have the building blocks in place which we have to execute to ensure a good performance in the balance year.Thank you for listening. I would now like to welcome any questions.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone"

title,Allocate 30-40% of portfolio to small & midcaps for wealth generation; Here's how
datetime,2019-01-04 09:46:00+00:00
description,"For aggressive investors, ideal equity portfolio allocation should be somewhere in the range of 30-40 percent with respect to small & midcaps, suggest experts"
content,"If I tell you select midcaps still offer good value at current levels, would you believe it? Well, the way mid and smallcaps collapsed in 2018, chances are bleak that anyone would want to invest in the broader market.Yes, it is true that retail investor portfolios are bleeding as most of them went overweight in small and midcaps last year after witnessing a strong rally in 2017 when the Smallcap index rose about 60 percent and saw more than 160 stocks that more than doubled investor wealth.But, after steep correction in 2018 – when the S&P BSE Midcap index fell 13 percent and the S&P BSE Smallcap index dropped 23 percent — valuations have become slightly attractive as compared to the beginning of 2018.Even the thematic mutual funds fell sharply from what they were quoting at the beginning of 2018.For aggressive investors, ideal equity portfolio allocation should be somewhere in the range of 30-40 percent with respect to small & midcaps, suggest experts.Amit Sood, 35, market research head turned trader in 2014, told Moneycontrol that his portfolio took a hit as broader market nosedived but he said he is in it for a long haul with a time horizon of more than 10 years.“With a longer time horizon, all these temporary tsunamis-like gyrations appear to be small ripples. I don't feel perturbed by the volatility. I have a firm conviction that they will give good returns in the long run,” he adds.Briefly, the carnage in mid and small-cap stocks was caused by mutual fund selling owing to the new categorization of MF schemes, GSM/ASM circular of SEBI, changes in equity taxation, governance issues, recent IL&FS crisis, etc. The LTCG tax also impacted the investor sentiment.So, should one invest in mid or smallcaps in 2019? Well, the answer lies in one's risk-taking ability, and stock selection remain the key.IIFL, in a note, said that investors in 2019 should focus on sustainability of earnings growth than the percentage of growth while investing in the current round of market uncertainty.“As small and midcaps are down by more than 30%, one can start to bottom fish in good quality companies but avoid averaging stocks whose fundamentals have deteriorated significantly,” it said.So what is the right portfolio composition for you this year? Most investors who were overweight in 2018, as well as 2017, have already reduced their exposure.But, if you are an aggressive investor, IIFL said you could allocate 32 percent towards smallcaps, 40 percent in midcaps, and 28 percent towards largecaps, this is in accordance to their model portfolio in December.NoneNoneSince small and midcaps are down with double-digit losses in 2018 there is an opportunity to find good quality stocks at attractive valuations in these segments but avoid averaging stocks whose fundamentals have deteriorated significantly, suggest experts.“We are focused on stories, which are benefiting from crude price fall. Also, we are seeing some improvement on liquidity side for NBFCs which will help in a rebound in credit growth which will aid growth to these companies,” Abhimanyu Sofat, Head of Research, IIFL Securities Ltd told Moneycontrol.“At any given time, one should invest based on their risk profile. There is no hard and fast rule; an aggressive person can invest 70 percent in equities, 20 percent debt, and 10 percent in gold, whereas a person with a moderate risk appetite can invest 50 percent in equities, 35 percent in debt, and 15 percent in gold,” he said.He further added that from a tactical allocation perspective, one can increase weight in equities with a bias towards smaller and mid-cap companies.B Gopkumar, ED & CEO, Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol that investors should allocate 60 percent towards largecaps, 40 percent in midcap and smallcap for a risk-neutral investor with no immediate cash requirements is advisable.None"

title,TDS on property sale: Answers to common queries on deduction and payment
datetime,2019-01-04 09:23:00+00:00
description,The TDS amount that is deducted must be deposited with the government within a period of seven days from the end of the month in which the deduction is made.
content,"Archit GuptaNoneThis rule has been effective since July 1, 2013 and applies to any person making payment on the purchase of immovable property where the total consideration is more than Rs 50 lakhs.While this rule has been in existence for a long time now, taxpayers continue to face hardship in understanding and complying with these provisions. The responsibility to deduct and deposit the TDS is of the buyer of the property. Although Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has been persistent in clarifying the procedures to follow, individuals are yet to fully understand compliance of the law. Let’s understand these common issues and their resolutions.It is wrong to assume that TDS must be deducted on the portion of consideration that exceeds Rs 50 lakhs. Law states that the TDS of 1 percent must be applied to the entire consideration amount where the total consideration exceeds Rs 50 lakhs. This is a common question that gets asked.TDS is deducted at the time of credit to seller’s account or on payment of the first installment to the seller, whichever is earlier. Further, where the payment is being made through the bank as a loan disbursement, the buyer must ensure to give standing instructions to the bank to deduct TDS from the total amount, while making the transfer. Several buyers fail to intimate the bank on this aspect and later face repercussions. If the buyer does not do this, relevant penalties may apply.The TDS amount that is deducted must be deposited with the government within a period of seven days from the end of the month in which the deduction is made. Otherwise, interest must also be paid on the delay. An online payment challan is available on TIN NSDL website for electronically depositing TDS in Form 26QB. Form 26QB serves the dual purpose of being a challan and a statement of detail of payment made.What many deductors do not understand is whether the payment of taxes online is done first or the filing of the Form 26QB. It is clarified that TDS payment can only be made online, either instantly by the deductor himself while filing Form 26QB or at his convenience on a subsequent date by visiting authorized banks or through net banking.This is done by filling up the requisite details while filing Form 26QB and choosing either of the options. In the case of subsequent payment, deductor must save the acknowledgement and ensure that his PAN and PAN of the seller must be correctly keyed in.NoneWhat if one misplaced the acknowledgement slip for payment through bank branches? Although there is an online option to retrieve the acknowledgement slip, it requires mentioning of the acknowledgement number and details of PAN. If one has not noted it, such a deductor may have to approach the jurisdictional assessing officer. So be careful with noting these details.Like any other TDS transaction, a TDS certificate must be issued to the seller by the buyer in Form 16B within a period of 15 days from due date of deposit. If the TDS returns in Form 26QB is filed beyond the due date as belated returns, the buyer needs to pay a late filing fee and interest same time, or else will face notice from the department.CPC-TDS has also enabled the online functionality for correction in Form 26QB. However, committing an error in quoting the PAN or other important details in the online form can cost you time and effort as there is no online mechanism for rectification of errors, but you may have to contact Income tax department of your jurisdiction. This is one main issue that has not found an easy remedy till date.Buyers must exercise caution while paying for the property purchased from NRI. The procedure and rate of TDS will be different and not covered by Section 194IA. A different section 195 requires a higher rate of a tax deduction if the NRI is not able to obtain a certificate for lower TDS deduction from the income tax officer. In case there is such a certificate, it must be validated and then lower rate of TDS has to be deducted. Not just that, but the buyer is required to obtain TAN and file this in Form 27Q online.While the above matters concerned buyers, resident sellers have to worry about the blockage of their money throughout the year, even in cases where they plan to reinvest in another property. The TDS amount that is deposited with the government is only refunded upon filing of the return, when an exemption has been claimed. An error in filing of Form 26QB can cause the seller undue hardship, where TDS although deducted from payments made cannot be refunded back until Form 26QB has been corrected."

title,GM Breweries Q3 review: Rise in input costs hurts margins
datetime,2019-01-07 10:22:00+00:00
description,"With an installed capacity of 13.8 crore litres, GM Breweries is the single largest manufacturer of country liquor in Maharashtra. "
content,"NoneNone ------------------------------------------------- NoneNoneMargins decline on a sequential basisThe topline benefitted from a robust demand during the festive season.  On the cost front, the prices of raw materials (rectified spirit) remained largely stable on a sequential basis but the rise in packaging costs dented the operating margins in the quarter gone by. Prices of PET bottles were higher in Q2 and Q3 due to increase in crude oil prices in the international market as well as adverse currency movements.NoneBrent crude oil appears to have peaked at around 85 dollars per barrel in September and October and have seen a deep correction since. While the Q3 margins hit yearly lows of 20 percent, we anticipate a recovery in margins from Q4 onwards as the PET bottle manufacturers have undertaken successive price cuts during the months of October, November and December.  Besides, the company is gradually shifting to glass bottles to mitigate the packaging-related cost pressures.Operating at nearly 50 percent capacity utilisationWith an installed capacity of 13.8 crore litres, GM Breweries is the single largest manufacturer of country liquor in Maharashtra. Driven by higher volumes, the capacity utilization moved closer to 50 percent in the last fiscal year.  Going forward, the company plans to leverage its brand presence in Mumbai and Thane to penetrate deeper into other districts of Maharashtra.Outlook and recommendationAt the current market price of Rs 640 per share, the stock appears fairly valued at trailing 12-months price-to-earnings multiple of around 14x. However, the stock should be kept on radar for accumulation on dips as the company has strong business fundamentals (debt-free balance sheet and return on capital of more than 25 percent). The company has sufficient capacity headroom to grow the volumes by more than 20-25 percent for the next 3-4 years. However, business execution as well as competitive landscape and regulatory risks needs to be monitored closely.Follow @Sach_Pal"

description,"In all, the classics had returned with much fanfare and their comeback has augured well for both the industry and the enthusiasts."
content,"The introduction of GST rates and revised taxation policies gave the two-wheeler industry in India a big reason to cheer. A plethora of bikes were introduced, and many were even localised, with KTM taking the lead in Indian motorcycle manufacturing. Along with KTM, Suzuki localised their Hayabusa and BMW set up their first showroom in Maharashtra.Along with the brand new, cutting-edge motorcycles, we also got some classics which ruled bygone days and have come back to reclaim their stake in the hearts of Indians.EICMA 2018 proved to be a major turning point in the history of the Indian motorcycling scene as the Jawa brand was brought back to life by Mahindra. Jawa is a Czech motorcycle brand founded in 1929.The brand which produced excellent two stroke bikes and ruled small capacity commuter motorcycle market fell back after being overtaken by more modern technology of the day. Jawa, however, made its reappearance in 2018, with the launch of the Jawa, the Jawa 42 and a custom bobber called Perak.The next name which reappeared in the list of motorcycles is the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650. Although it was launched with an all new and powerful Continental GT 650, the Interceptor caught the most attention as it was the revival of the orginal Interceptor by Royal Enfield.The 650cc parallel-twin engines powering both the motorcycles have been well received and are a fresh change from the erstwhile single cylinder engines.Suzuki too jumped on the bandwagon too with the Intruder 150. For the uninitiated, the Intruder was Suzuki’s flagship super commuter, sporting a massive 1800cc engine but it proved to be more of a menace than a pleasure.However, with the reduction of the engine size to a pocket friendly 155cc, and by borrowing hardware like the digital instrument cluster of the Gixxer 150, the Intruder became a fresh and exciting alternative to the Bajaj Avenger."

content,"Demand from motorcycle enthusiasts has seen a rise recently prompting manufacturers to come up with more offerings. From retro fanatics, to the outdoorsy adventure tourers, everyone wants something at a smaller capacity so as to be able to enter the segment at a more affordable cost. Here are some of the newest bikes that have come to India and some which are in the line-up.KTMThe Bajaj owned, Austria based motorcycle company has previously established its foothold in the super moto, super sport and naked sports bikes. With marvels like 1290 Super Duke, RC8 and the all-time favourite, 390 Duke, KTM has garnered a steady and loyal fanbase for itself. Now, acknowledging the attempts of previous KTM owners of taking their bikes off-road, and taking inspiration from their already triumphant Dakar rally prototype, KTM is introducing the next iteration of their trustworthy 373cc single-cylinder engine, the KTM 390 Adventure. While in essence still a Duke at heart, the 390 Adventure is what the name suggests, an ADV bike. Expected to be launched in 2019, the 390 Adventure is KTM’s first entrant in the sub 400cc ADV segment.KawasakiKawasaki also scaled down their own range of offroaders, bringing in the Versys-X 300. With slipper clutch, a 300cc parallel-twin motor, and long travel suspension the Versys-X 300 is all ready to take on the Indian mountains.JawaJawa is a Czech motorcycle brand, which had a major say in the Indian motorcycling scene from the early 70s to the late 80s. With their roaring two stroke engines, and rugged street appearance, Jawa left a permanent fondness in the minds of riders of that era. Now in 2018, Jawa was resurrected with the new Jawa and Jawa 42 motorcycles, along with the more powerful bobber, Perak, coming in 2019. Sporting the iconic roadster look of Jawa, the 293cc engine puts out 27.37 PS of power and 28 Nm of torque.Royal EnfieldA much-needed change in the century old legacy, Royal Enfield finally upped their game with their first parallel-twin motor for two of their latest offerings, the Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650. While the engine is brand new, the motorcycles itself date back to a long while ago, when the Royal Enfield Interceptor wasn't received well.  Now, with renewed engineering and promising specs, the Interceptor is set to battle it out in the power cruiser segment.Emflux"

The S&P BSE Sensex broke below its crucial support at 36,000 and closed with losses of little over 1 percent for the week ended January 4.The S&P BSE Small-cap index which fell by about 23 percent outperformed Sensex, Nifty as well as the S&P BSE mid-cap index.

Thus the pattern is yet to break down on a closing basis.“The weekly chart shows that the Index has formed a multi-week distribution near the crucial weekly moving averages. Over there, the Nifty has formed an Engulfing Bear candlestick pattern for the last week,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.“The weekly momentum indicator has nearly completed the pullback cycle.

title,Hero ZMR to Royal Enfield Trials: Top 5 bikes that may launch in 2019 under Rs 2 lakh
datetime,2019-01-04 18:35:00+00:00
description,A list of upcoming motorcycles in 2019 that could cost under Rs 2 lakh.
content,"Since Yamaha launched its flagship motorcycle, R15 V1 in India, the market for 150-200 CC motorcycles has increased significantly. Ranging from commuters and scooters to outright sports bikes, the variety and demand for such motorcycles have increased considerably.With the competition heating up, here is a list of top five upcoming bikes under Rs 2 lakh:1. Yamaha MT-15Keeping up with the tradition, Yamaha is gearing up to offer their iconic R15’s naked sibling, the MT-15 in India. Though it has little to no resemblance to the grandfather V1, its latest iteration, the V3 is expected to be a strong influence on the naked single cylinder.With Yamaha not providing USD (upside down) forks with the R15 V3, it wouldn’t be wrong to expect MT-15 to also come with conventional forks. Nevertheless, Yamaha should be generous enough to give their latest engine the VVA tech (Variable Valve Actuation). It may also see an improved Deltabox chassis.As for pricing, it could be placed between the Rs. 1.5-2 lakh range, in competition with the KTM’s Duke 200, Duke 125 and Suzuki’s Gixxer, among others.2. UM DSR 200 AdventureThe hitherto unknown American cruiser manufacturer entered India in a direct challenge to all budget cruisers, with models like Renegade Commando and Renegade Sports S.Now, UM has stepped up its game by deciding to enter the adventure touring segment, choosing to cater to the sub-300 CC buyer class. With no fixed dates for the launch as yet, all we can talk about right now is its 196 CC, single-cylinder air-cooled engine, which is fuelled by a carburettor.UM claims the power of 16.2 PS and 16 Nm, which is satisfactory, but not overwhelming. The engine is mated to a 6-speed gearbox, which should add to the rider’s ease.3. Hero Karizma 200The lustre around Karizma, whose first model acquired legendary status, has dimmed a bit with successors such as ZMR. Now, Hero seems to be looking to make amends with their upcoming fully-faired Karizma variant.Supposedly based on the Xtreme 200R, the 200-cc naked bike from Hero, it is expected to be launched before the end of 2019. Consequently, it wouldn’t be wrong to assume a better and faster engine tune and fuel injection. The bike will also comply with BS 6 norms. With these advancements, a price tag of Rs 1.5 lakh would be justified.4. Suzuki Gixxer 250Suzuki managed to do an excellent job of keeping its next project under wraps, but with the leak of the patent details of the upcoming motorcycle, we have a clearer picture of what to expect.To begin with, Suzuki has ditched its usual “twin-cylinder support” in favour of its single cylinder, Single Overhead Cam (SOHC) engine layout. A vertically mounted oil-cooling system is expected to tag along.Continuing the Gixxer legacy, the engine is also set to have a fuel injection system for better fuel efficiency. Coupled with ABS, and a launch date in March, the Gixxer 250 could be priced around Rs. 1.2-1.5 lakh.5. Royal Enfield Trials 350Royal Enfield’s upcoming project, the Trials 350 and 500, has been revealed. The success of the Interceptor 650 has given a fillip to Royal Enfield's plans. The Trials are the next release, based on its ever-popular Classic look, albeit with a few cosmetic and ergonomic changes.The bike now sports a single seat instead of the usual dual seats. In place of the back seat is an additional luggage carrier; and a Continental GT-like taillight. With RE expected to use its existing line-up of engines, the power figures could be in the same range as its current motorcycles.  However, it is possible that Royal Enfield may change the tuning of the engines to suit the riding conditions better."

title,Five things you probably didn’t know about Suzuki Jimny
datetime,2019-01-05 11:03:00+00:00
description,A list of less known facts about Suzuki’s upcoming utility vehicle
content,"Suzuki Jimny has been around for a long time, probably longer than most people think. While originally from Japan, the Jimny quickly gained popularity around the globe as a vigorous, compact yet rugged utility vehicle. Now, with its latest reincarnation set to hit the roads soon, it only fits that we take a look at five things you probably didn’t know about Suzuki Jimny:50-year-old legacyThe Suzuki Jimny might be rebranded as a modern utility vehicle, but it was birthed a long time ago. Formerly under the parenthood of Hope Motor Company (HMC), the Jimny is the descendant of 359 CC, air-cooled, two-stroke, inline twin engine bearing cars called Light Jeep 10 (LJ10). But by the time Jimny came into development, HMC had been taken over by Suzuki in 1960, and the first gen Jimny, named LJ80, received a robust 800CC, four-stroke, inline four-cylinder engine in 1970.Influence on Maruti GypsyDecember 1985 saw the launch of one of India’s most iconic UVs, the Maruti Gypsy. It was based initially on Suzuki Jimny, as Suzuki had collaborated with Maruti at that time, and shared the same wheelbase. However, as Gypsy’s generations passed, the resemblance to the Jimny diminished, and the current gen Maruti Gypsy King shares more of a cosmetic resemblance to the Jimny than any actual components.Off-road competitionBeing a rugged UV in nature, it is evident that the Jimny is about to face some fierce competition, both in the market and on the terrain. However, with the fourth-gen Jimny expected to be getting an all-new 660cc RA06 3-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine producing 64PS and 95Nm, it has gained enough power to lock horns with the likes of Mercedes Benz G-Class, among other UVs, regarding off-road credentials. Jimny boasts the highest departure angle among the lot, which means the maximum angle at which the rear of the car can hold.Purposeful colour optionsThe neat and compact looking UV is charming enough already, but Suzuki’s idea of coming up with its colour schemes was very different. While at first glance the Jimny looks like any other vibrant, peppy car; but the colours are made with a purpose. The Kinetic Yellow, for instance, allows the teeny tiny Jimny to stand out in adverse weather conditions like dense fog or other similarly harsh off-road conditions. Even the Jungle Green colour, reportedly, is supposed to help it merge with the surrounding better. Talk about camouflage!Modern amenitiesThough the Jimny carries a half-century old legacy and a retro SUV look, it is in no way technologically primitive. Expected to carry a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay along with automatic climate control and others, the Jimny will surely be a modern force to reckon with"

content,"Despite sharing the same platform and having a much heavier price tag, two premium bikes by BMW Motorrad have outsold their sister TVS bike.NoneThe G 310 R, G 310 GS and the Apache RR 310 were born out of a common platform developed by TVS and BMW and use many shared components, including the engine. They are made from the same factory in Tamil Nadu owned by the Indian company.The BMW G 310 R is priced at Rs 2.99 lakh and the G 310 GS is priced at Rs 3.49 lakh (ex-showroom). The TVS Apache RR 310 is priced at Rs 2.23 lakh (ex-showroom).The drift towards a more expensive bike could be attributed to the pent-up demand for the two BMWs as well as the aspirational value associated with the German luxury brand. BMW G 310 R and G 310 GS have been developed in Munich, Germany by BMW Motorrad.For BMW, the two bikes are the cheapest bikes anywhere in the world (all BMW bikes are priced above Rs 12 lakh in India) but for TVS the Apache RR 310 is the most expensive bike it has ever built for sale (the second most expensive is Apache RTR 200 4V ABS at Rs 1.10 lakh).TVS has been struggling with the Apache RR 310 since its launch in December last year. Though the company had given a guidance of selling 10,000 units in the first year of launch it has fell short of that target.The Chennai-based maker of scooters under the Jupiter and Scooty brand managed to cross the half way mark in the given 12 months with sales of 5,113 units of the Apache RR 310. TVS started to sell the RR 310 through a limited line of dealerships to preserve the exclusivity of the bike. BMW sells the two models through 11 dealerships while the TVS bike is sold through a line of 65 dealerships."

description,A list of upcoming EVs in India in 2019.
content,"Electric vehicles have always fascinated people with their silent glide, battery life and the sheer absence of a petrol knob. But with petrol getting costlier than aviation fuel and rising overall pollution, people are turning towards electric vehicles (EVs) for a faster, safer and cleaner commute.To cater to that demand car manufacturers are either overhauling their existing cars as an EV, or designing an all-new car with electric motor. Keeping that in mind, here is a list of top electric four-wheelers  coming to India:1. Renault Kwid EVKicking off this list is the French beauty Renault Kwid, which is returning with an entirely new heart. Instead of the conventional IC engine (Internal combustion), it shall be battery operated, hence effectively nullifying its emission. Renault has needed this project K-ZE, which stands for Kwid-Zero Emisiosion. Said to be capable of doing 250 kmph, it could be priced anywhere between Rs. 6-8 lakhs.2. Mahindra XUV 300 EV (Codename S201)Petrol & Diesel Rates Aug 29, 2022Monday, 29th August, 2022NoneMonday, 29th August, 2022NoneThe Indian giant is not satisfied when it comes to beating the competition. Be it the latest Marazzo, or the now-defunct REVA-I. But now, since EVs are making a grand re-entry, it would be only fit for Mahindra to develop an EV themselves. Taking a cue, Mahindra decided to step in with the XUV300 based S201. Having roughly the same size, shape and structure, the S201 could carry a price tag of around Rs 20 lakh.3. Mahindra KUV 100Mahindra is rather proud of its UV lineage, boasting a range of cars for various segments, as well as rugged and durable builds. Their youngest member, however, the KUV 100 is set to get a significant upgrade. Ditching the conventional IC engine, Mahindra has decided to give the technology of tomorrow, a fully electric generator, to the KUV. It is powered by a 3-phase AC induction 31kW electric motor coupled to a lithium-ion battery. It boasts of a claimed range of 140km and is equipped with fast charging capable of charging the battery to 80 per cent in less than an hour.4. Audi e-TronGerman speedster Audi is no stranger when it comes to making fast cars, regardless of the segment. Now, Audi has upped the game with the arrival of Audi’s e-Tron, a fully-electric SUV. With two electric motors, one on each axle, the front makes 125 kW while the rear engine produces 140 kW, with the combined total of 265 kW or 355 bhp. The peak torque output is 561 Nm. In the boost mode, the power output goes up to 300 kW or 408 bhp. In short, a silent, electrifying beast of a car.5 Hyundai Kona EVThe most anticipated and talked about EV of the lot, the Kona boasts of a sleek design, futuristic features and a massive range of 312 km on a full charge. Certainly raising expectations, it could be priced around the Rs. 25 lakh.6 Nissan Leaf EV"

With that in mind, here are four things you should know about Husqvarna’s Vitpilen and Swartpilen 401:The nameThe name derives from vit and pilen, which essentially means white and arrow in Swedish.

Sporting 373 CC engine and the signature orange alloys among other components, Husqvarna is gracefully, yet noticeably carrying the KTM influence.First ventureThough being a veteran when it comes to building rough and tough motorcycles, this is Husqvarna’s first stint at a 400 CC street motorcycle built on the KTM frame.Possible pricingSince Husqvarna has collaborated with Bajaj owned KTM, it has decided to begin its global manufacturing from the KTM plant at Chakan. Although, because it carries a rather excellent name, it could be priced a little higher than its economic cousin, and could fall in the range of premium nakeds like BMW’s G310, or Kawasaki’s Z400."

description,"With leisure being the prime objective, read on to know how religious places serve as trending destinations."
content,"According to experts from various travel booking websites, when corporate professionals are asked about major travel trends of 2019, a common element figures in most responses  – spiritual vacations.Spiritual vacations are going to be one of the most sought-after trends in the coming year. Popular travel portals such as MakeMyTrip, Thrillophilia and Travel Triangle have already packaged destinations as Spiritual Heritage or Heal your Souls. And the ones who haven’t yet may soon follow suit.To escape the routine of tiring brainstorming sessions, exhausting excel sheets and meetings, top management across the board now prefer heading to Tirupati, Bodh Gaya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Pushkar, Bhutan or other places of religious interest instead of non-descriptive hill stations and beach towns.NoneBut, do they metamorphose into Romans when in Rome? Absolutely not. Instead, they prefer to bask in the silence of a resort, attend prayers at temples or monasteries and in general relax in the spiritual surroundings, away from the regular crowds. Technically, they are redefining the concept of how CEOs chill. With leisure being the prime objective, how do the religious places serve as trending destinations, then?“In last one/two years we have noticed a growth of 6-7 percent in terms of top-level corporate travellers coming for spiritual rejuvenation. There are groups as well as individuals who take these trips.”“We get several top honchos who come and stay with us on a regular basis. Most of the time they come with their families (parents included). Several of them have also come back with their colleagues on offsite visits with us,"" said Tanya Agrawal, Director, Shri Radha Brij Vasundhara Resort and Spa, Govardhan, Mathura.Promoted by Shri Group, a prominent real estate developer of North India, the resort offers 24 cottages, a restaurant and a spa and is located at walking distance from most of the temples at Govardhan.NoneThe activities“Most of the C-level executives who visit us, come here mostly to relax and rejuvenate. Many of them just don't want to do any activity. They just want to sit, walk and laze around. Then there are the spa sessions. Some of them spend time in the gymnasium. A few of them go for a trek of Parikrama as well. During evenings, they mostly spend time playing indoor games,” added Agrawal.“On a spiritual rejuvenation, we have seen corporate professionals engaging in yoga and meditation. Most corporates who go for these trips wake up early. Being in the city for too long, they are devoid of fresh air. So when in the yoga routine, I generally prescribe more breathing exercises to make their lungs detox a little. Besides, they don’t binge eat, neither do they drink. While this is a spiritual rejuvenation, these trips detox their organs as well,” said Urmilla Singh, Founder, ReJuve, a start-up dedicated to yoga, naturopathy and spirituality, based in Pune.“Travelling to spiritual places for vacationing for me always means a sense of peace, solitude, and relaxation. This kind of immersive travelling culture which is gradually gaining popularity is often influenced by one’s affinity to look inwards for finding peace and is here to stay. Many of these locations are offbeat in nature and enable you to experience a break beyond the routine touristy experience,” said Ashish Dhruva, Vice President-Marketing, Cleartrip.And if the experts from the online travel firms are to be believed, this trend is here to stay."

title,Learn how to profit from an oscillating market strategy
datetime,2019-01-06 11:53:00+00:00
description,"It is always profitable to know this kind of market neutral strategies as well, as one is capable of trading other than just unidirectional moves"
content,"Quantsapp Private A trending market always attracts the attention of all traders. But there is another dimension which is not discussed that often and which is an oscillating market. Today, we will talk about the most basic strategy that works especially well in an oscillating market set-up.In simple words, oscillating market is defined as a market which reverses its gains after a big move and then rallies back again, or a market which moves repeatedly back-and-forth.But before we do that, let us first understand an important Option internal, Delta. Delta is nothing but rate of change in an Option with respect to change in its underlying price.If looked at the same internal from a different angle, Delta is a fraction of total exposure of the underlying.Let us understand this concept better with the help of an example. Suppose, stock X is trading at Rs 1,000 and has 1,000 CE trading at Rs 30. If the stock rises to Rs 1,010, the Call will also rise. Considering the Call goes up to Rs 35.5, we can conclude that the Delta of 1,000 strike call is 50.A Delta of 50 indicates there would be a 50 percent movement in the underlying stock. Considering with the underlying at Rs 1,000, the Call is capable of returning 50 percent of the stock as denoted by its Delta. We can also say that 1,000 Call represent 50 percent of the stock, with the counter trading at Rs 1,000.One more very important characteristic of Delta is that it is an increasing function of price for a Call Option and decreasing function of price for a Put Option. Let us understand it further.Increasing/decreasing function means that as the price increases Delta for a Call would increase. Taking the previous example forward, at Rs 1,010 Delta of 1,000 strike Call would be higher.If the stock goes up from Rs 1,010 to Rs 1,020, the 1,000 Call would be Rs 41. This means that there is an increment of Rs 6 this time against the next Rs 10 move in the underlying.The sensitivity increases, in other words the Delta increases to 60 percent now for the Call as the stock goes up. The speed at which this Delta increases is also of importance but is a separate topic in itself.Similarly, if we had a 1,000 strike Put and it moves from Rs 990 to Rs 980, here too with every incremental negative move the Delta will increase.Basically, 1,000 Put would represent a Delta of -50 percent. The same Delta would go to -60 percent as we move to Rs 990, increasing the premium growth on the way to Rs 980.This Delta figure would be available to you on any standard Option calculator easily and freely available on the web.The actionable out of this entire explanation is simple. Buy the Option and take an offsetting position to neutralise the Delta. In an attempt to do that, one would create a trade set-up that is beneficial.Meaning, buy a 1,000 Call, having 50 Delta. Create an offset by selling 50 percent quantity of the lot size. And now keep managing the offset.If the stock goes up and Delta goes to 60, sell an additional 10 percent. If the stock goes down to Rs 990 and Delta goes to 40, buy back 20 percent.Considering that the calculations and intervals of this offsetting exercise is not continuous and are periodic, the buy low and sell high would end up outperforming the premium paid to acquire the Option.A similar trade could be done in Puts as well. For all practical purpose, these trades come in very handy when the markets loiter around at lower levels. One is waiting for stability to buy. This is an ideal deployment.It is always profitable to know this kind of market neutral strategies as well, as one is capable of trading other than just unidirectional moves.The author is CEO and Head of Research at Quantsapp Private "

description,"An Ascending Triangle is a bullish formation that anticipates an upside breakout whereas Descending Triangle is a bearish formation that anticipates a downside breakout, says Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal."
content,"Chandan TapariaContinuing with the classic chart patterns, we will be discussing Triangles. There are three types of triangles - Ascending, Descending and Symmetrical Triangle.An Ascending Triangle is a bullish formation that anticipates an upside breakout whereas Descending Triangle is a bearish formation that anticipates a downside breakout. Symmetrical Triangle, where price action grows increasingly narrow, may be followed by a breakout to either side, up or down.Ascending TriangleAscending Triangle patterns are bullish and their appearance indicates that a security’s price is likely to climb higher as the pattern completes itself. It is recognisable by a right triangle created by two trend lines.In such type of triangle, one trend line is drawn horizontally at a level that has historically prevented the price from heading higher and the second trendline connects a series of increasing troughs. Eventually, price breaks through the upside resistance and continues in an uptrend.NoneThis pattern develops when a security’s price falls but then bounces off the supporting line and rises. However, each attempt to push prices higher is less successful than the one before, and eventually, sellers take control of the market and push prices below the supporting bottom line of the triangle.NoneSymmetrical Triangles represent a period of consolidation patterns that may forecast either the continuation of the existing trend or a trend reversal. In other words, it may represent a breakout or breakdown.NoneA breakdown from the lower trendline marks the start of a new bearish trend, whereas a breakout from the upper trendline indicates the start of a new bullish trend.NoneNone"

title,ONGC first gets forced to buy HPCL and now buy its own shares back
datetime,2019-01-07 10:28:00+00:00
description,"This situation has arisen because the government needs to meet its divestment target of Rs 80,000 crore by the end of this fiscal"
content,"CapitalmindWe have some big numbers here.NoneBut now, they not only have slimmed their coffers but also picked up loans, like people pick-up vegetables during a discount rush. And all that because of some ill-considered decisions taken by our present Central government regarding this PSU company.NoneBut ONGC is hugely cash-flow positive, and in the first six months after this report, it reduced its debt to just Rs 14,000 crore.The reason for pointing this sticky situation out is that the Central government recently directed cash-rich state-run companies that have a lot of idle capital, to utilise it by handing out dividends and carrying out buybacks. Why? Because they need to meet their Rs 80,000 crore divestment target.That means that even ONGC (even after buying HPCL) has to roll out dividends and buybacks. However, considering its current position, ONGC says it can either do a buyback or pay dividends, or better, neither, until the next financial year.While they are still pleading the Ministry of Finance to exempt dividend, unfortunately, due to pressures from the government, they have agreed to carry out the buyback. The buyback is for 2.34 percent of its shareholders' capital, which comes to Rs 4,022 crore. The record date set for both is January 4.Now the question is how is ONGC going to pull this off? Answer: It can't and it doesn't have the cash anymore. Not unless ONGC picks up more loans, or reduces its efforts to pay back the loans it currently has.NoneSecondly, ONGC holds around 134 crore shares in IOC and IOC recently declared dividends and buyback. If you look at only the dividend aspect, IOC will pay Rs 6.75 per share. For ONGC that means around Rs 903 crore. Then there's the buyback as well.The IOC buyback is for about 3 percent of its shares at Rs 149. Assuming ONGC sells back 3 percent of its holding to IOC, that's 3 percent of 134 crore shares or 4 crore shares at Rs 149. This is about Rs 600 crore.Finally, ONGC has received $32 million from PDVSA, as part settlement of outstanding dividend payments (ONGC owns 40 percent stake in Venezuela's San Cristobal project). Assuming $1 = Rs 70, this comes to Rs 224 crore.So, they get about Rs 1,700 crore from dividends/buybacks of their holdings. That provides them with about 40 percent of what they need for the buyback, and the rest (of the Rs 4,022 crore) will have to be sequestered from their profits of the two quarters.Their goal of being debt free may have to wait. They were supposed to pay back the entire loan they took to buy HPCL within a year. But that may extend another six months if it has to do this buyback and pay a dividend.All in all ONGC seems to be in a tough (but not impossible) situation. They generate enough cash to be able to pull it off.The problem, however, is that the government as the primary shareholder gets in the way of efficient functioning. We could analyse this and say ONGC has the money for now, but what if the greedy government keeps wanting more? As a shareholder, this might not be exciting.It also tells you the perils of investing in a government-owned company, but at least they siphon off the money after telling you about it. In most other companies, you don't even get to know about how much money’s been looted.The author is the CEO and founder of Capitalmind.in"

description,"Researchers from Assam University have found a high concentration of lead and cadmium in water that leached from both old and new glazed, colourful ceramic cups heated in the microwave"
content,"Your brightly coloured tea cup/coffee mug could be leaching lead and cadmium into warm beverages.NoneThe report, titled ‘Leachable lead and cadmium in microwave-heated ceramic cups: possible health hazard to human’, was published in Environmental Science and Pollution Research in November 2018.It assumes importance given the widespread use of glazed colourful ceramic cups and mugs as well as microwaves in homes and workspaces to heat food and beverages.These highly toxic and carcinogenic metals breached the US Food and Drug Administration’s (USFDA) permissible limits of 0.5 milligrams per litre (mg/l), according to the report.As per the study, average concentration of lead was 15 times and six times higher in new cups (7.69 mg/l) and old cups (3.15 mg/l) than USFDA norms, respectively. Similarly, average cadmium concentration stood at 1.57 mg/l and 1.97 mg/l, respectively, which is four and three times higher than permissible limits.India is yet to prescribe permissible standards. The Bureau of Indian Standards specifies limits for both these metals but only in enamelware. However, these are only voluntary and do not cover ceramics.The research findings also apply to beverages prepared using a gas stove as the temperature of boiling water is enough to leach the metal from the cup wall.Suchismita Das, Principal Investigator, and Assistant Professor at the Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, told the newspaper: “Glazed cups with colourful paints are very popular in India. These coats are fired on to ceramics at high temperature, but improper firing often results in loosely adherent glaze, which is readily dissolved by the leaching medium.”Researchers warn that regular consumption of beverages from popular ‘Made in China’ cups can be extremely harmful for children, pregnant women, or women of child bearing age, the report stated."

But, it seems to be struggling to do so.With little over 5,000 units clocked in its first year, sales of the TVS Apache RR 310 has remained disappointingly low while that of BMW 310 series crossed a significant milestone last month, of 50,000 units in less than two years.The TVS bike has underperformed when compared against the internal target set by the company of selling 10,000 units in its first year of launch.The Apache RR 310, BMW G 310 R and BMW G 310 GS are built on the same platform, powered by the same engine and are built at the TVS Motor’s factory in Tamil Nadu.The two companies had joined hands in early 2013, for a non-equity based partnership that was committed to sharing of technology and manufacturing facility as well as jointly developing new products.After several delays, TVS was able to launch the Apache RR 310 in December 2017, more than nine months after the twin BMWs started exports. After a gap of more than a year, the two BMWs were launched in India at a significant premium compared to the TVS bike.NoneNoneRelying on the mopedThough TVS had built its brand image in the premium motorcycle market with the Apache brand followed with an attempt to push it further helped by its association with BMW, more than one-fourth of its sales continue to come from mopeds.TVS remains the only company to make mopeds, whose average selling price is Rs 33,600 running across four variants. This is substantially less than the average price of the highest selling TVS model Jupiter at Rs 56,000.Till November this year, the TVS XL 100 (moped) clocked more than six lakh unit sales with a growth of 6 percent emerging as the second highest selling model for TVS after Jupiter. Meanwhile, with the lukewarm response for the Apache RR 310, TVS is struggling to make the cut in the premium motorcycle segment.The XL 100 generates annual revenue of around Rs 2,900 crore while the Apache RR 310 is understood to have generated around Rs 114 crore in revenues in its first 12 months."

title,Trekking along: Benelli's TRK 502 could shake up the off-roader segment
datetime,2019-01-08 12:23:00+00:00
description,A list of features of Benelli’s upcoming adventure tourer.
content,"Chinese-owned Italian bike maker Benelli has produced consistently satisfying motorcycles throughout its legacy of more than a century.Now, with the adventure segment gaining popularity rapidly, Benelli has set its sights on the sub-600 CC engine capacity and is set to unveil its TRK 502.With its launch date just around the corner, here is a list of features of Benelli TRK 502:1. EngineSporting a compact yet powerful 499 CC twin cylinder engine, Benelli has kept its signature trait of making high performance, low capacity engines. Producing an estimated 47.6 BHP and 45 Nm of torque, the engine will give a thrilling but not overwhelming off-road experience. Mated to a 6-speed gearbox, the engine could give the rider a smooth and hassle-free ride.2. BrakesThe TRK 502 comes with dual 320 mm discs at the front and a single 260 mm disc behind. This homologation of parts seems to be the way to save costs on spares and after-sales service. Naturally, a dual channel ABS comes as standard.3. SuspensionBenelli has been thoughtful enough to provide the TRK with USD forks, which will increase stability and decrease rider feedback on rough terrain or in times of emergencies.4. TiresBenelli’s upcoming adventure tourer wears the same shoes as its younger sibling, the TNT 300. A 120/70-ZR17 at the front and a 160/60-ZR17 at the back, the TRK 502 has its feet placed firmly on the ground. And considering Benelli’s generosity, it might even come with Pirellis as standard.5. PricingThe most important factor in deciding a motorcycle’s fate is sales. Benelli has agreed to keep the price of its upcoming off-roader at a surprisingly low Rs 4 lakh margin. Although the exact figures are not yet disclosed, a small price range like that could redefine the entire motorcycling market in India."

description,A list of features supposed to be in Toyota’s upcoming MPV.
content,"Toyota’s former flagship, the Innova, has ruled over Indian hearts since decades. With the launch of the Crysta, however, things were upped by a considerable notch. Toyota managed to set a benchmark in the SUV segment of the Indian market, one which will probably stay for a long time. Now with Innova’s younger sibling, the Avanza, set to roam the Indian streets after almost a decade of missing out on the Indian market, it seems that the MPV segment in India could have a new contender. Keeping that in mind, here is a list of things to expect from the new and upcoming Avanza.Toyota lineageKicking off this list is the most crucial parameter in the Avanza launch, the brand name. Carrying the Toyota emblem on its head, the Avanza has big shoes to fill in terms of customer expectations, as the Innova has always managed to please its audience.Space constraintBeing a smaller version of Toyota’s popular SUV, the Avanza has an ambitious claim of being able to seat 6-7 people. But with passenger comfort becoming increasingly important, and car manufacturers focussing exclusively on interior design, the Avanza could face fierce competition in terms of comfort and luxury.Power figuresRegarding engine size, the Avanza sports a 1.5L inline four motor; not the biggest in its class. However, with a decent power output of 103hp and 136Nm, it should be able to munch miles with relative ease.EntertainmentSporting a simplistic infotainment system, the primary source of music will be an AUX port or the good old radio.Mileage"

title,Want to fool-proof your Will? Make a video
datetime,2019-01-08 09:25:00+00:00
description,"Though it is not mandatory to video record the Will, there are a few situations in which the video recording is recommended by the estate planners."
content,"S Lakshmi (name changed) a Mumbai-based retired professional opted to write a Will after her husband’s death. She wanted her younger son to inherit all her wealth.Her family’s relations with her elder son has been strained for the last ten years. Neither her deceased husband nor she wanted the elder son to inherit anything. She sensed the possibility that her Will may be challenged by the elder son in the court of law.Her advisor suggested her to record the video of the process of signing the Will and keep the recording safe with her Will, as a proof of the genuineness.Ignore making a Will at your own riskWill is a document that records the wishes of an individual pertaining to a transfer of his assets after he dies. Hence, writing a Will is a must if you own assets and intend to pass it on to the persons of your choice, say most financial planners.A will can be revoked or changed as many times as one wants. The maker of the Will (testator) is free to dispose of his property that is recorded in his Will the way he wants. The Will comes into effect only after the testator dies. The last Will of the testator prevails nullifying all previous Wills written by him.There are two challenges most individuals face when it comes to estate planning. First, not many people write a Will and second many Wills lack on one count or the other such as not following procedural requirements and not updating the Will timely.Many individuals still associated the idea of writing a Will to death. Some think that Will writing is what rich people do. But most ignore the fact that Will enables the asset owners to transfer assets to the persons they chose, after the death of asset owners.“There is a general apathy towards estate planning. Most individuals do not think that they need to write a Will. If you want your assets to go to people you want, better write a Will,” says Sandeep Nerlekar, MD & CEO, Terentia – a Mumbai-based estate & succession planning advisory firm.Second challenge in estate planning is to write a Will that won’t be contested. Video recording of the Will writing process comes into the picture when one wants to ensure that the Will goes unchallenged.“Though it is not mandatory to video record the Will writing process, it is advisable to do so if you want to reduce the chance of Will getting contested in the court of law,” says Anju Gandhi, partner with SNG & Partners a legal firm. Video recording of the process can be used as evidence by the court to ascertain the genuineness of the Will, she adds.The video recording can be done by using a smartphone or some handheld camera. You can also consider hiring a professional for Rs 2000 to Rs 5000.“Though it is not a legal requirement to video record the Will, we do advise video recording of the Will writing process because it makes obtaining probate easy,” says Neha Pathak, head – trust and estate planning, Motilal Oswal Private Wealth Management.Probate is a copy of the Will certified under the seal of a competent court of law with a grant of administration of the estate of the testator.Make it look like a video, not a photographIf you are going to do it yourself, ensure a few points while recording the Will signing process. Say something on camera to make it look like you are healthy. For instance, you can state your name, the date of that day, the place or city in which you are at the time of recording, and so on. You should also specify that you are writing your Will.“Such details can establish that the testator was in good health, had a fair idea of what he was doing and was not under any pressure to sign the Will,” says Anju Gandhi.The testator can also read out the initial paragraph of the Will. This need not contain the vital contents such as which asset goes to whom. It can remain confidential.“Video recording must capture the testator and the witnesses signing the Will. You may also want to video record the presence of the doctor certifying the fitness of the testator,” says Neha Pathak. This makes it an evidence difficult to challenge in the court of law.When video recording of Will is preferredThere are a few situations in which the video recording is recommended. “It is advisable for all age groups to be video-graphed not only aged or with health issues - as it establishes the execution of the will as a bonafide action and that there was no fraud or undue pressure” says Anju Gandhi.Many a time Wills signed by very old persons are contested in the court of law, stating that the Will was obtained by coercion or some other unfair means. If one chooses to video record, then it helps in proving that the testator at the time of signing of the Will was in good mental health and was not under any influence or coercion.A point to note is video recording does not replace the Will document. It simply proves that the signed Will document is one signed by the testator as he wished.Sandeep Nerlekar recommends video recording of the Will if you expect a possibility of the Will getting contested in the court of law. A divorce, estranged legal heirs, ongoing family disputes especially for money matters, pending family settlements are some of the scenarios in which you should ensure that you go for a recording of the Will."

title,Ideas for Profit | This little-known Indian firm is a major Vitamin D ingredient producer

description,"China's effort on clean environment has impacted the supply side of Vitamin D3 market – particularly the animal feed market. Price rise has been in this category has been in the order of 3-4x in last one year. Additionally, vitamin D3 prices in the human segment have also risen by 20-25% on account of structural changes like limited supply and increasing awareness."
content,"NoneHighlights:None --------------------------------------------------NoneIn the past few quarters, the company has witnessed strong earnings growth on account of steady improvement in the demand for Vitamin D. Additionally, ongoing supply-side reforms in China has led to favourable supply-demand dynamics.China's supply-side reforms are initiatives that the country has taken to streamline production in line with environmental norms. The net effect has been costs have increased or production has gone down.Fully addresses the domestic demandFermenta Biotech is the sole manufacturer of Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) API in India and almost fully caters to the domestic industry needs of vitamin D3 applications in pharma, dietary supplements, food and animal feed. It’s noteworthy that 20 percent of the company’s revenue comes from the domestic market.As per pharma market research firm, AICOD AWACS, the domestic vitamin D3 market size has increased at a CAGR (2014-18) of around 16 percent, more than the growth rate of overall vitamin market. This implies a similar growth in demand for vitamin D3 API.Significant market share in international marketDIL derives rest of its revenue from the international market, where it has a significant market share. Europe followed by the USA are the key export markets. Globally, Fermenta Biotech has a market share of about 25-30 percent in the Vitamin D3 API market for humans. In the animal feed market for Vitamin D3, market share is about 6-7 percent in terms of volumes.Internationally, the company competes with MNCs like DSM. Further, Chinese manufacturers such as Zhejiang Garden Biochemical High-tech, Taizhou Hisound Pharmaceutical, Kingdomway and NHU are also key players.Opportunities for Indian firms in the international vitamin D3 market have increased over the years. Data from the Ministry of Commerce suggests that export of Vitamin D3 has surged sharply in recent years. During April-Oct period of FY19, export volumes has increased by 77 percent compared to the corresponding period last year.Table: Vitamin D3 value chainNoneChart: Vitamin D3 export volume (tonne) in form of tablets, capsules, syrup NoneBarriers to entryThe barriers to entry in this segment are similar to that prevalent for any pharma API market which includes technology and regulatory permissions. However, other than being a niche segment, Vitamin D3 production involves a heavy upfront investment as there needs to be a certain threshold scale of production to start with. Technology for photosynthesis replication is also tricky. Further, long process optimization gestation for the new plant and long client approval cycle are other hurdles for the new players.Beneficiary of strong price trendSupply-side reforms in China have impacted the financials of various companies in pharma API industry depending on where they are placed in the supply chain. DIL has been a beneficiary of this trend and has witnessed a strong operating performance in the last few quarters aided by pricing tailwinds.Steps taken by China on the environment front has impacted the supply side of Vitamin D3 market – particularly the animal feed market. The price rise in this category has been of the order of 3-4x in last one year. Additionally, vitamin D3 prices in the human segment have also risen by 20-25% on account of structural changes like limited supply and increasing awareness.New capacity with multi synthesis capabilitiesDIL has been adding capacity on a periodic basis to meet structural improvement in demand. Last capacity addition was in early 2017 in Dahej which added about 25-30% increase in production capacity.Fermenta Biotech is undergoing an investment of Rs 55 crore which will lead to capacity enhancement of 15-20 percent by the end of FY20. The project is majorly funded through debt (Rs 40 crore).The company has availed ECB route requiring 3-3.5 percent interest rate. Interest liabilities are not hedged for currency movement as it can be paid through export earnings. The project will have multi synthesis capabilities which in turn would facilitate product extensions and new product rollouts.Balance sheet remains supportiveCompany’s balance sheet remains supportive. At the consolidated level, net debt to equity is about 0.75x which gives it a leeway to fund capex program. Peak D/E is not expected to go beyond 1x during the upcoming capex cycle.Factors to watch out forNoneAt present Fermenta Biotech ensures the supply from manufacturers in Europe and Japan through annual contracts. Raw material prices have been relatively stable for last two years after surging during the period 2010 to 2016.Stock outlook aided by double-digit volume growth in the human segmentThe company has a key focus in the human applications for the vitamin D3. This segment is expected to grow by double-digit in volumes terms aided by structural demand and applications in personal care and nutrition. Another, supportive driver for earnings is that in case of animal segment, pricing can remain high and may not revert to pre 2017 phase because the factor cost for producing Vitamin D3 in China has increased significantly over the years.Positioning as a nutraceuticals companyAt a strategic level, we are enthused that company is positioning itself as a nutraceuticals company. To meet this objective company is looking for both organic and inorganic opportunities. Company’s plan for a multi synthesis platform is a step in that direction.Table: FinancialsNoneNoneFinally, valuation remains supportive with the stock trading at about 12x FY19e earnings which is closer to the lower range for the API segment. In our view, Investors with high-risk appetite can watch out for this stock.None"

content,"Nitesh KhandelwalIt is no news that technology has changed the way we work, communicate, transact or even live. Given it has already changed a common man’s life, it is unimaginable that technology doesn’t transform the competitive industry of financial markets. The research says that it already has.NoneTrading, as we know, basically involves the buying, selling or holding of securities. Now, when we append the word ‘Algorithmic’ to trading, we are introducing the use of algorithms into trading. An algorithm can be defined as a set of steps or rules which are followed to solve some problems.NoneNoneAlgorithmic Trading involves building and implementing trading strategies using computer codes and programming. A trading strategy is basically a plan or a set of rules which are defined to conduct the process of buying and selling while trading in order to achieve a particular outcome like increasing profitability, better execution, etc.These trading strategies can be tested on historical data to evaluate how they’d have performed if they were traded as per the parameters during the given time period. This process is called as Backtesting, which helps one minimise losses and maximise profits as per analysis of their performance on the historical data.How is Algorithmic Trading different from manual trading? Manual traders place their trades by studying the market conditions, analysing the signals and charts and creating a trading logic accordingly. Whereas, in algorithmic trading, one can place a trading logic in a machine and let the machine evaluate the opportunities based on the live market conditions and thereby take or suggest a trading decision whether to go long or short or hold the position.One can also automate this process of taking trading decisions based on the analysis which eliminates human emotions from the decision-making process thereby reducing the risks involved in taking emotion-based decisions.How are Algorithmic Trading, Quantitative Trading, HFT and Automated Trading different from each other?NoneNoneNoneNoneHow to start Algorithmic Trading?If a person is an absolute beginner with minimal knowledge of Algorithmic Trading, then he should start off by building three necessary skills. First, quantitative skills, which help in building better models and trading strategies.Second, trading skills to incorporate the basic knowledge of the working of financial markets and what affects them. And, the financial computing skills that help in coding the trading strategies and understanding models through a quantitative framework. A combination of these skills will enable one to successfully implement Algorithmic Trading strategies.A person who doesn’t have adequate knowledge in this domain but wishes to build a career in algorithmic trading or start trading algorithmically, may start building his/her skills and start acquiring the financial as well as the technical knowledge required to become an Algorithmic Trader.What does the future hold for Algorithmic Trading?Algorithmic trading has shown exponential growth in recent decades and still continues to maintain the upward trend. Technology is playing a huge role in taking over the tasks done manually by automating them. Just as the automobile manufacturing got transformed from shop floors crowded with people to the new age shop floors that are entirely managed & operated by robots, trading in financial markets have been evolving with the rapid adoption of technology & data analytics.NoneThe author is co-founder of QuantInsti, an Algorithmic trading training institute."

content,"On January 7, 2009, Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, founder and chairman of Satyam, wrote to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the company's shareholders admitting that he manipulated the company's accounts to the tune of Rs 7,000 crore, shocking the global corporate community. Nearly 94 percent of the reported cash reserve of the company had been fictitious.The confession blew the lid on what came to be known as India's Enron. Satyam's shares fell from a high of Rs 180 to a low of Rs 76, dragging down the Sensex 7 percent.As Raju explained, the company had started off by inflating some of its financials, and got caught in the quagmire of ever-increasing expectations on how to keep up the performance. ""It was like riding a tiger, without knowing how to get off without being eaten"".NoneSatyam's backstorySatyam Computers was India's fourth-largest IT company, behind TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Raju was held as one of the torchbearers' of the Indian IT story. Satyam had won several awards for corporate governance.But something was amiss. A few months before Raju confessed, Satyam had announced it would take over its group company Maytas Infra (Maytas' name was Satyam's spelled in reverse).The proposal led to a lot of consternation among investors. Why would an IT company want to acquire an infrastructure company? Were there not enough opportunities left in IT?In hindsight, this was a last-ditch attempt by the Satyam promoters to merge two companies -- a move that would have helped Raju continue to cook his books more effectively with an asset-heavy infrastructure firm.The evening the announcement came out, Satyam shares sold off in US trading, sealing the fate of the proposed acquisition. With the share price depleted, Satyam couldn't use its stock to buy Maytas. The next morning, Raju confessed.Events sinceAfter the scam came to light, independent directors, auditors, banking partners and related entities to Satyam became the center of attention. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were independent auditors of Satyam when the news of the scandal surfaced. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined the Indian arm of the auditor $6 million, slamming its failure to detect such a fraud. In 2018, SEBI banned the company from auditing any listed company in India for two years.The Company Law Board disbarred the board of the company and appointed 10 nominal directors in 2008. The then Corporate Affairs Minister Prem Chand Gupta said the board failed to do their duty and at their expense, the credibility of India's IT industry should not suffer. Deepak Parekh, former NASSCOM chief Kiran Karnik, and former SEBI member C Achuthan were nominated by the government to Satyam's board.NoneWhat happened to Raju?Raju was arrested by the police in January 2009, along with his younger brother B Rama Raju and got bail from the Supreme Court in 2011, as the CBI failed to file a chargesheet.The market regulator slapped a fine of Rs 1,849 crore on Raju and barred him from the markets for 14 years.

description,"SC has overturned a judgment by the Delhi High Court which held that certain items such as seeds, plants and animals cannot be patented under Indian laws."
content,"NoneMonsanto’s subsidiary Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (MMBL) has won a legal battle against Nuziveedu seeds to own patents on genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds in India. The Supreme Court has ruled that Monsanto’s patent for BT cotton seeds is valid, overturning a judgment by the Delhi High Court which held that certain items such as seeds, plants and animals cannot be patented under Indian laws.NoneWhile the judgement is positive for Monsanto that had been battling to get royalties for its BT cotton seed technology, it could mean an uptick in costs for domestic seed players due to higher pricing freedom to Monsanto and continued royalty payments. This could mean lower margins for companies, seed scarcity in domestic markets and could also give way to spurious seeds, negatively impacting yields.Domestic companies get a license from Monsanto to sell GM seeds in exchange for a trait fee fixed by the government. This fee was reduced from Rs 49 per packet to Rs 39 per packet last year. Monsanto has pending cases against fixing the cotton price and trait fee by the government and the current ruling might strengthen Monsanto’s claims.Though on the one hand, it means higher costs for domestic seed players, on the other, the judgement also stands to boost the confidence of global players about the validity of patents in India. Biotech companies may resuscitate their plans of expansion in India, put on hold following several restrictions imposed by the Indian government.Moreover, amid the royalty row and patent infringement, Monsanto had refrained from introducing the latest Bollgaurd-3 technology in India and the cotton production had witnessed severe pink bollworm attacks. The court’s ruling might lead to the introduction of new technology in the country by global biotech giants.Follow @Ruchiagrawal"

It is unusual for a big-ticket movie to release alongside a Rajinikanth movie.NoneNoneStarting on a high note, plenty of Tamil films will hit theatres this year taking the count to possibly over 250 releases. According to experts, Tamil cinema produces the highest number of movies in the film industry which, on an average, releases about 200 films every year.Last year too, the industry in southern India produced around 180 films, according to analysts. However, lack of screens and the 50-day shutdown were major hiccups for Kollywood in 2018. Yet, the industry had a larger share of successful films.While lower screen count is a pan-India issue for the film industry, it was the standoff between Tamil Film Producers’ Council (TFPC) and digital service providers (DSP) that marred Kollywood in 2018. The producers were demanding lower rates of the Virtual Print Fee (VPF) that DSPs charge for the release and casting of movies on screens across India.As screens operate digitally, exhibitors are in need of digital cinema equipment which is provided by DSPs. The producers were demanding the service providers to bring the prices down by 25 percent across the board.TFPC President Vishal, had said that the industry was spending a lot on VPF and that there should not only be a price cut but the fee should be withdrawn after a period of time. The conditions laid down by TFPC were that Rs 12,000 should be paid as VPF and the fee should be done away with after three years.During the stalemate, no new releases had hit the theatres. What made it worse was that producers had chosen the holiday season for the strike. It is during this time when exhibitors make most of their money in a year. Even film shoots were on a halt during that time. The strike which started on March 1 ended on April 19, 2018.According to reports, the Tamil film industry incurred a loss of Rs 5-8 crore every day on an average during the strike.Apart from producers and theatre owners, the film crew suffered the most during the shutdown.In addition, when the industry resumed work, a large number of films were left to be released in theatres which led to overcrowding. And this, in turn, led to small films losing out screens and even being removed from theatres.NoneNoneEven small-ticket films did not disappoint. As many as 10 small size films made huge sums at the ticket window."

With an all-new diesel engine, electric concepts and turbocharged iteration, Maruti Suzuki is gearing up for a whirlpool of car launches. That said, here is a list of upcoming Maruti cars:Maruti Suzuki Future S ConceptKicking off this list is a brand new ‘compact SUV’ concept car showcased at the 2018 Delhi Auto Expo. While there are no recent plans of taking this car into production, the company's claim that the Maruti Suzuki Future S concept previews its future compact car design and next level of ""design evolution"" regarding proportions, body sculpting and fusing body patterns and colours, could mean that Maruti is serious about this compact SUV.Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza PetrolWith the immense success of the Vitara Brezza as a commercial vehicle and a long haulier, Maruti decided to answer the call of petrol-heads, coming up with a petrol version for the SUV. Reportedly, the Vitara Brezza is to share the 1.0L Boosterjet motor currently powering the Baleno RS. This could give the Vitara Brezza a power output of 100 BHP and 150 Nm of torque, as opposed to the current 1.3-litre Multijet diesel engine generating a peak power of 89bhp and 200Nm of torque.Maruti Suzuki Swift RSAcknowledging the request to infuse dose of adrenaline to the agile Swift, Maruti Suzuki has finally given the Swift a turbocharger. Borrowing the mighty 1.0L Boosterjet engine from its current sibling and rival the Baleno RS, the Swift will produce a maximum power of 100.5bhp and 150Nm of torque. This motor will be mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, although an automatic version is expected too.Maruti Suzuki JimnyOne of the most iconic cars of yesteryears, the Jimny is set to make a comeback on the Indian streets, with an all new and improved avatar. At the heart of the beefed-up body of the jeep will be the 1.4L Boosterjet engine, mated to a 5-speed gearbox. A 6-speed AMT option will be available as well.Maruti Suzuki Wagon R 2019"

While the engine stays untouched, almost everything around it has changed.Here is a list of features expected to be in the 2019 Wagon R:1. ExteriorMaruti has pampered its popular hatchback royally, placing it on Suzuki’s latest lighter and safer platform. It would not be wrong to presume that the Wagon R will get chrome finishes for the grille, among other styling components.2. InteriorThe interior of the car will be completely reworked as well, with a digital infotainment system expected to be present. This will elevate the look and feel of the vehicle, offering a more premium experience to the driver.3. AmenitiesIn terms of driver satisfaction, Maruti Suzuki has gone all out, fitting the Wagon R with projector headlamps, alloy wheels, telescopic steering wheel, among a long list of other features.4. SafetyConsidering the current standards of safety, Maruti Suzuki has gone an extra step to ensure that the people outside stay as safe as the passengers inside. Along with dual airbags and ABS, Wagon R is also reported to have EBD, which is Electronic Brake Distribution. EBD essentially distributes the braking force applied by the driver evenly, so that the wheels do not lock up and skid in situations of emergency or heavy braking.5. Pricing"

Srinivasan did not suggest what level should the two-wheeler segment be taxed at.“Given the importance of two-wheelers as an item for mass mobility, the GST rates for two-wheelers undoubtedly needs to be reconsidered. It certainly cannot be benchmarked against the prevalent GST rates for luxury goods at 28 percent, especially given the current state of inconsistencies with the integrated multi-modal public transport systems across India”, Srinivasan said in a statement.None“With new safety norms and BSVI integration also around the corner, both of which will increase two-wheeler prices, it has become even more imperative to relook at the GST rates for two-wheelers to ensure social inclusion that is sustainable in the longer run”, added Srinivasan.NoneThe automotive industry will brace for more than one upward revision in price over the next 15 months. These will be as a result of the new safety norms from April 1 this year and the new emission standard norms from April 1, 2020. A combination of these will likely result in an increase of a minimum of Rs 8,000 (almost 20 percent jump) in prices of budget (100cc) two-wheelers."

title,Quick Take | Does the govt believe that more than 95% Indian households need job reservations?
datetime,2019-01-08 14:47:00+00:00
description,Studies show that at least 95% of Indian households earn less than the government’s cut-off income of Rs 8 lakh
content,"The centre wants a quota of 10 percent for ‘economically weaker’ general category households for government jobs and admission to educational institutions.The new quota is ostensibly for ‘economically weaker sections of the people who are not covered by any of the existing schemes of reservation’. The cut-off for economic weakness is a household income of less than Rs 8 lakh per annum, the same as the cut-off for reservations under the OBC (Other Backward Caste) category.How many Indian households have annual income less than Rs 8 lakh?The first inkling that this yardstick has little to do with helping the poor is seen from the Central Statistics Office’s first advance estimate of Gross Domestic Product, which projects per capita annual gross national income at Rs 1,03,633 for 2018-19.Assuming a family of five, average household income in India would then be Rs 5,18,165. Since the average or mean is much higher than the median income, the threshold of Rs 8 lakh is very high.What is the percentage of households that will be included? A 2017 paper by Thomas Piketty, the poster boy of research on inequality, may give us some clues.The celebrated paper, titled ‘Indian income inequality, 1922-2015: From British Raj to Billionaire Raj?’ has a table which shows that the threshold annual income in 2015 for being in the top 10 percent incomes in India was Rs 1.95 lakh.The threshold for being in the top 1% was Rs 13.03 lakh. It can safely be said, therefore, that the Rs 8 lakh cut-off will include somewhere between 90 to 99 percent of India’s households, very likely in excess of 95 percent.NoneThat means individuals having a gross taxable income of Rs 5 lakh and above constitute the top 1.6 percent. Going by these estimates, even if we consider that some households will have more than one earning member and that the upper castes have more well-off people, we could again easily say that at least 95% of households will be within the Rs 8 lakh cut-off limit."

title,Do add-on features for health insurance policies really add value?
datetime,2019-01-09 10:14:00+00:00
description,"Add-ons are additional features that you can buy, as a top-up, to your base health insurance policy. However, there are caveats to remember before buying add-ons."
content,"While health insurance covers are base policies that cover hospitalisation costs, many health policies come with add-on features that aim to provide monetary support for specific ailments. For instance, child birth involves hospitalisation, a basic health insurance policy doesn’t cover it.When Delhi-based Mayank Verma, 30, bought a health insurance policy in January 2018, he was about to get married. He found out that a base health cover of Rs 10 lakh would require him to pay an annual premium of Rs 9,600. Add the maternity benefit to the same policy, and his premium would go up slightly to Rs 11,500 for the same policy. He decided to buy the add-on feature and the couple got married in December 2018. “We were planning to have a baby after 3 or 4 years,"" says a gleeful Verma.Add-ons are additional features that you can buy, as a top-up, to your base health insurance policy. But there are caveats to know before buying add-ons. Besides, there are standalone health policies that may prove to be more beneficial.Maternity BenefitA child birth can set you back by Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh. Either of the spouses can include the maternity add-on in their basic health insurance policy. But there is a waiting period, typically 2-4 years, to claim maternity benefits.Kapil Mehta, CEO, Securenow.in told Moneycontrol that insurer includes the extra cost related to maternity with the premium amount of the standalone health insurance and increases the overall premium of the policy. ""The total premium amount can go up to Rs 50,000 per annum for particular health policy, if you take this add-on at a later stage in your life. So, it is advisable to take this add-on at an early age, that is, in your 20s or early 30s and where, you have at least 4 years of time to plan for a baby,” he said.Critical IllnessThe critical illness add-on provides immediate lump sum amount irrespective of the total expenses incurred on the diagnosis of the covered illness.Note that there are standalone critical illness plans also that cater to cover just your critical illnesses and not your general health. These plans are independent of your standard health insurance covers. Should you still buy a critical illness add-on cover with your health insurance policy or a standalone critical illness?Here, ignore your add-on cover and opt for a standalone critical illness policy. Here’s why: Critical illness, such as cancer, kidney failure, paralysis, and so on, can be prolonged and incur large expenses. You need to plan sufficiently for this. Just an add-on critical illness cover may not be enough, typically. That is because the sum assured on add-on policy cannot be greater than the base health insurance policy.A standalone critical illness policy, on the other hand, gives you a higher coverage.For example, if you take a standalone critical illness policy against cancer, the premium for a 30-year-old male will be around Rs 2,000-2,500 per annum against a total cover of Rs 30 to 40 Lakh. For the same premium, a policy add-on will get you a maximum cover of only Rs 20-25 lakh.Personal AccidentYou can add a personal accident add-on feature to an existing health insurance policy. This compensates for all kinds of the accident including permanent total disablement, accidental death, permanent partial disablement and temporary total disablement.Here too, the add-on is just a feature, but the cover isn’t as comprehensive as a standalone personal accident cover. A personal accident add-on features covers the policyholder for around Rs 2-5 lakh; it varies from policy to policy. If you opt for a standalone personal accident policy, you can buy a cover of up to Rs 75 lakh. Also, a standalone policy can provide you with global coverage while taking health policy with the same add-ons will not.Vishal Dhawan, Founder & CEO, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors told Moneycontrol that buying a standalone personal accident cover works better than an add-on for two reason. One, due to the recent unbundling of the third-party insurance cover, you can now buy a single personal accident cover for as many vehicles as you own. Hence, you save on the premium. And second, a standalone cover covers you for a larger amount than the add-on cover, just like in the case of the critical illness cover.Hospital CashThis cover provides you daily cash that a policyholder may require for taking care of hospital-related and other medical expenses during hospitalisation. It would determine coverage based on the daily allowance which you have agreed with insurer under the plan. For example, taking care of small medical bills, extra blanket cover (which are not covered in the base policy), illness, and small accident. Also, it is paid for a certain number of days of hospitalisation as mentioned in the health insurance plan. Most of the hospital cash policies pay you daily cash which is in the range of Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,500 per day.However, you should know that the patient does not get the cash benefit at the end of each day. It again has a waiting period, you get this money in lump sum post-hospitalisation once the patient gets discharged. But, the important thing that you need to know is that the waiting period to claim hospital cash amount for these small bills, illness, are of shorter tenures compared to getting claim from overall all policy, which takes time.You need to submit all the bills where expenses related to medicines and other dispensary are mentioned. The cash is paid through NEFT in the bank account of the policyholder.""It only makes sense to have this add-on if the insurer gives you at least Rs. 5,000 or more for a day to cover your daily medical related expenses,"" says Mehta.Super-top up Under this product, additional coverage is offered over and above the threshold limit (deductible). So, once you consume the threshold limit, any extra charges incurred by the hospital will get covered under the top-up policy.Let’s say you have a health insurance policy for Rs 5 lakh and also a Top-up Health Add-ons for Rs 10 lakh with the threshold limit (deductible) of Rs 5 Lakh.So suppose, if there is a claim for Rs 8 Lakh, your normal health policy will pay Rs 5 Lakh and the remaining claim amount of Rs 3 Lakh will be covered by your Top-up health add-ons.The advantage with the super top-up plan is the threshold limit which gets applied when one consumes all cover limit, considering all the claims put together in that particular policy year.Ashish Mehrotra, MD & CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance says that Super Top-up policies come handy when the threshold of the existing health insurance cover is already used or exhausted and it provides an additional health insurance cover, over and above your existing health plan and enhance the sum insured of the base plan.You can buy a health policy with higher cover but in that case, you may end-up paying higher premium for a particular policy. It is good to buy a decent cover and take to-up add-on as when it is required in a particular year.What should you do?Add-on features give extra benefits over and above a base health insurance plan. The problem is that although premiums for these add-ons are low, the benefits that you can accrue are limited."

title,SEBI puts transfer of physical and demat shares on par in case of death
datetime,2019-01-08 17:05:00+00:00
description,How an investor’s equity shares got bequeathed after death to their heir so far depended on whether he/she left behind physical or dematerialised shares
content,"Transmission of shares (or transfer of shares after the death of a shareholder) in case of dematerialised shares will now call for the same procedure as transmission of shares in physical form.The capital market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said in a circular dated January 4, 2019, that it wanted to harmonise the procedures for transmission of securities in the dematerialised mode with that of transmission of securities in physical mode. The latter’s guidelines are listed in SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (Sixth Amendment) Regulations, 2018.As investors get ready to switch fully in dematerialised mode come April 1, 2019, let’s take a look at what this means.Up till now, how an investor’s equity shares got bequeathed after the death to their heir, depended on whether he/she left behind physical or dematerialised shares. While the former used to be governed by SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR), the latter used to be governed by Bye-laws and Business Rules of the respective depositories (National Securities Depository, or NSDL, and Central Depository Services (India) or CDSL).Under the said SEBI LODR, if an investor leaves behind physical shares held jointly, the shares would pass on to the surviving joint holder. But if the shares were held singly by the investor, then the procedure for transmission will depend on whether the investor has made a nomination or not, and whether there is a probate of will or succession certificate or letter of administration.If there is a nominee to such shares, the nominee has to come forward and submit a transmission request form, attach a death certificate of the deceased holder attested by a notary.In case the shareholder has made no nomination, then the procedure for transmission of shares set out under the SEBI LODR requires a duly stamped affidavit by all the legal heirs, or by the identified legal heir if there is a probate of will or succession certificate or letter of administration.“A probate of will is a judicial process where the will is “proved” or certified by a competent court of law as the true last testament of the deceased.”, says Ashok Sathyanathan, Partner, SNG & Partners.What if there is no nominee as well as no will and the shares were held singly? Under SEBI LODR, if the value of such shares per listed company does not exceed Rs 2 lakh, then a simple no-objection certificate is required from all legal heirs in favour of the claimant to such shares or alternatively a family settlement would also do, together with an indemnity bond.If the value of such shares is more than Rs 2 lakh and there is no will or nominee, all legal heirs are required to come together to give a signed declaration affidavit and identify and register the rightful claimant to such shares.The procedure for transmission of shares held in dematerialized form as set out in the business rules of respective depositories prescribe that where there is no nominee, then a probate of will or succession certificate or letter of administration is required.If there is no nomination and in the absence of a probate of will or succession certificate or letter of administration and where the value of shares in the demat account does not exceed Rs 5 lakh, then a family settlement deed or a no objection certificate from all legal heirs in favour of the claimant together with a duly stamped affidavit is required to be furnished, in addition to an indemnity bond provider.But if the value of the shares in the demat account exceeds Rs 5 lakh, the claimant is required to furnish probate of will or succession certificate or letter of administration. “Under the SEBI LODR, in the absence of nomination and probate of will or succession certificate or letter of administration, all legal heirs are required to provide a duly stamped affidavit to the effect of identification and claim of legal ownership of the shares.”, says Sathyanathan.What should you do?January 4 ruling brings the procedure for transmission of demateriased shares on par with physical shares. The good part here is that with the mandatory dematerialising of shares in case their shareholders wish to transfer them, effective April 1, the transmission of shares under demat mode needed to be strengthened."

title,Creative calculation: Why investing in films is not a bad idea

description,"For starters, investors don’t have to be millionaires to crowdfund a film. People can even fund an amount as small as Rs 500."
content,"Priyanka Sinha JhaGiven India's collective obsession with movies, it’s no surprise that film-makers are turning to audiences for funding, using crowdfunding and retail-finance techniques. If tech startups can do it why not films? After all, every film can be viewed as a small startup with the filmmaker as the entrepreneur.NoneNoneOnir admits that when he started his experimental film project he was unaware of the existence of formal crowdfunding platforms. But, he noticed that people would often send him e-mails and messages on Facebook, offering finance or their resources or skills for free. So once the scripts were in place he realised that subjects like child abuse, the humiliation of homosexuals, displacement of Kashmiri Pandits, did not fall under the ambit of formula films. As such, they were unlikely to be funded by members of the film industry. So, instead of knocking the familiar doors and face rejection, he decided to raise funds for each story separately by reaching out directly to the viewers. He put up an online post about the story of each short-film, inviting people to help financially. People identified with the different stories and sent in their contributions accordingly.The first cheque Onir received from a Pune resident was for Rs 2,000 for the short film about child abuse. Having gone through a similar experience, the sender had withheld his/her identity but wanted the story to be told. Another gentleman wanted to make a contribution as a wedding gift to his wife — just to see her names in the film credits!NoneCrowdfunding, which essentially is making a donation, has so far has worked well for the smaller Indie films. In fact, it works well for all involved. For starters, investors don’t have to be millionaires to crowdfund a film. People can even fund an amount as small as Rs 500!When it comes investing in films, donations with incentives attached are the most popular way to invest in India. Besides their name in the credits, there are other perks too depending on what the filmmakers are willing to offer. It could be an invite to the film’s shooting, a special screening or a chance to meet the stars. Sometimes it is an opportunity to support a creative cause.The proliferation of formal Internet-based crowdfunding platforms like Wishberry, Ketto, and Crowdera, has helped this cause. In fact, now some crowdfunding platforms have been so successful that they have even started securing finance and actively producing the films that come to them for crowdfunding help.Interest in films as investments has grown over 2017-2018 with the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Focusing on content over stars, these platforms have essentially democratised content consumption based on market preference. Besides high concept content, regional films too are great investments for HNIs as they are made on a fraction of the cost of a regular Bollywood film and still retain a good ROI.One of India’s leading crowdfunding experts, Priyanka Agarwal, co-founder and CEO of Wishberry, has had an interesting journey in this field. After successfully running a small crowdfunding platform, Agarwal has now set up a new age film-financing studio, Wishberry Films. She is able to thereby balance the equation between art and commerce.Agarwal makes a clear distinction between the two ways films are being funded by individual investors, ""Crowdfunding and film financing have two different types of markets. Through crowdfunding, we help independent film-makers raise money for their projects below Rs 50 lakh by helping them leverage their own personal networks, including friends, family and patrons. While crowdfunding is for philanthropic purposes, film financing has HNIs treating films as a return-on-investment asset.""For HNIs, the film-finance or investment route is a lot more attractive. ""As we live in a value-conscious country, film financing definitely has more scale. People care about a bang for a buck, so scoring investments for films is a lot easier as people are always looking for assets to invest in,"" avers Agarwal.NoneAgarwal agrees that films are a riskier investment than say, mutual funds. She would rather compare film investments with investing in startups. “We target a 30 percent annual ROI. However, given a successful box-office run, you can expect a return of 50 percent to 75 percent as well. The key advantages of film investments over startups are shorter liquidity cycles - anywhere between 12 to 15 months. Whereas in a startup you have to wait for 4-6 years without a guarantee.”Although investment in films is gaining ground, there is healthy cynicism around it given the unpredictable and risky nature of the movie business. The poor track record of film-funds like the Cinema Capital Venture Fund and others that were announced but never started, has not been good for investor confidence.It is critical that companies and individuals getting into the film-finance business do the due diligence on their part. Films have many different revenue streams e.g. domestic box office, international sales, Internet and other digital rights, TV deals, music and so on. All films have different dependencies and different exploitation potential with regard to these revenue streams. Astute investors need to understand how the film-makers intend to leverage each of these streams for films they are investing in. The revenue sharing and exit-route for their funding should be clear before the individual even considers the film-investment opportunity.Says Agarwal, “At Wishberry we also incorporate LLPs per film and transfer the IP rights of the film to this LLP. We act as the designated partner and the filmmakers along with investors are general partners in these LLPs. This gives complete accountability and transparency to the investors with regards to expenditure and revenue sharing.”Given the keen interest that box-office collections generate nowadays among the general public, it is clear that interest in films now extends beyond entertainment. They are now also viewed as money-making propositions. Household discussions about whether a film will make it to the ‘100 Crore Club’ have become commonplace. Hopefully, adequate safeguards for investors in place in the future will make it easier for more film buffs to venture into investing in films and finally put their money where their mouth is."

title,Opinion | Indian Railways is headed for big trouble
datetime,2019-01-08 15:04:00+00:00
description,Looking at some of Nitin Gadkari's ideas would be a good place to start to fix railways' problems.
content,"NoneNoneNoneA critical parameter for judging efficiency – for ships, aircraft and even railways – is turnaround time.  For the railways, turnaround time worsened from 5.18 days to 5.32 days. Wagon-km per wagon per day also worsened. Freight earning also declined, if one excludes demurrage and wharfage.  What is worse is that return on capital plummeted from 6.99 percent to 1.62 percent.To understand the crisis, one must bear in mind that unlike other developed countries, Indian Railways makes its money on freight.  It is this money, which allows it to subsidise passenger traffic to a great extent. Passengers represent votes and there are studies, which show that passengers do not really pay the full cost of railway transport.NoneSince then, the railways’ attempts to regain freight market share has been a losing proposition. Thus, with freight earnings not coming in, it was inevitable that the railways would push up both passenger and freight tariffs.NoneNoneWater transport is the cheapest form of transport, followed by railways. Road transport is at times double the costs of railways on a per tonne per km basis.What this means is that customers were willing to opt for the most expensive form of transport because the India Railways was not found acceptable despite its lower costs. The railways continue to lose market share.This situation could become worse with Union minister Nitin Gadkari aggressively pushing for revival of water transport through inland waterways and coastal shipping. That means that the railways will have even more competition trying to grab its freight (as well as passenger) business.But why do people not like the railways?  One simple reason is that while roads allow for door-to-door pickup and delivery, the railways operate only from point to point.The railways have tried to address this problem, by trying to work with road transporters to pick up and delivery from the doorsteps of their customers. But that requires multiple handling and is too messy and expensive. After all, the railways are not the most efficient when it comes to loading and unloading operations.NoneMaybe, it should instead try a new method – it could learn from the ro-ro and ro-pax services that Nitin Gadkari’s ministry has been pushing both for waterways and for coastal transport. Ro-ro boats are those which allow for a vehicle – not just cars but fully loaded container trucks as well – to drive on to ships, and then drive off these vessels at the destination ports.The railways should redesign their rakes to allow fully laden trucks to roll on to trains, and then roll off at destination stations.  That way, the truck will save on fuel costs, the customer has to ensure loading and unloading of the consignment only once, and the truck offers door-to-door service in partnership with the railways.  And the railways have better capacity utilization.But this requires the railway management to be imaginative and to work with market developers – like Gadkari’s ministry has done. It must urge them to develop new vehicles, new solutions and also new packages. If the railways does not do this, it will see more business slipping away.That would be unfortunate because the railways is still the pride of India. It runs one of the largest network of railway lines in the world. And it is a very large employer in India (it employed 1.3 million regular employees at last count accounting for a wage bill of Rs.1.15 lakh crore annually. It also employs two or three times this number as contract employees).Can that be done?  Can the railways stop bleeding? Will the railways ministry provide people some answers?"

title,Hike in print media ad rates to give much-needed impetus to sector
datetime,2019-01-09 18:27:00+00:00
description,None
content,"Moneycontrol ResearchHighlights:None -------------------------------------------------There is finally some good news for print media companies that have suffered a flurry of setbacks in the past two years or so. On January 8, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) announced a 25 percent increase in the rates for newspaper advertisements by the Bureau of Outreach and Communication (erstwhile Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity- DAVP), an agency that takes care of the paid publicity requirements of all Central Government organizations. The rates will be effective immediately and valid for three years. The last revision in advertisement rates took place in 2013 when an increase of 19 percent was announced over and above the rates of 2010.Shares of leading print media companies reacted positively to the development gaining between 5-20 percent in the first half of trading on January 9.NoneEarlier, the central government was compulsorily required to tender notices in print media. The practice was stopped in FY18 through changes in General Financial Rules (GFR, 2017).  Despite this, the substantial revenue (around 15-20 percent of total revenues) of newspaper companies comes from the government. As a result, most players will benefit immensely from this move. Subsequent to the ad rate hike, we will see revenue increase and improvement in EBITDA margins for leading players. While the impact will not be visible in the coming quarter as the existing contracts carry the older rates, FY20 financials stands to improve due to the directive. Consequently, we can expect valuation re-rating of print media companies.Print sector reeling under multiple issuesThe print media industry has been saddled with multiple roadblocks in the past two years. It all began with demonetisation which disrupted the advertising revenue growth of the sector. While the sector was still recovering from the aftereffects of demonetisation, the implementation of GST and RERA caused many advertisers to cut down on their advertisement budgets again. As the second largest recipient of advertising revenue after broadcasters, print media sector was shaken by the new tax regime as print advertising came under 5 percent GST ambit. Consequently, revenue growth of newspaper industry in FY18 was the lowest in a decade at 3.9 percent as per KPMG report.Just when the sector started stabilising with ad spends reverting back to normal level, a rise in newsprint prices jolted sentiments again.But revival on the cardsSo while the print media is facing tough times, what makes us constructive on its future?  The answer isn’t quite so simple and there are multiple reasons for the same.First, upcoming elections are expected to boost advertising revenue. During the 2014 national elections, advertising revenue had risen by around 7 percent for the sector. Taking a cue from the same, we expect a rise in advertising revenue in H2FY19 on the conclusion of several state elections and in the FY20 due to national elections.Second, the biggest respite for newspaper companies comes from peaking of newsprint prices. The steep slide in crude is good news. The cost of newsprint has a positive correlation with crude prices as its production is a highly energy-intensive process. Stabilising rupee would further comfort the newspaper companies importing newsprint.Third, the operational performance of print companies is likely to improve.  Most companies have initiated cost-control measures such as curtailing circulation of less remunerative copies and optimising pagination to reduce the newsprint consumption. Also, the industry may consider increasing the cover prices. With around 70 percent of newspaper companies’ revenue coming from advertising, circulation so far has merely functioned as “a loss-leader to build audiences”.  However, with the sudden and unusual increase in raw material costs, the likelihood of increasing cover prices though small, has increased.NoneNoneFor print media companies, FY18 was an aberration and FY19 too has been a difficult year so far. While competition from digital the world is real, though much less pronounced for Hindi and regional newspapers, reports of the demise of newspaper industry seems vastly exaggerated. Multiple levers of earnings improvement in FY20 including yesterday’s rate hike announcement makes print media stocks worthy investment in an election year.Follow @nehadave01"

It has a 6.4-inch LCD screen with a hole on the top-left for the front-facing camera.NoneInside the View20's hole is a 25-megapixel selfie camera which is 4.6mm in diameter. Honor says its hole is smaller than what Samsung is offering on the A8s.The hole, however, isn’t the only thing that Honor did first. It is also the first phone to use Sony’s 48-megapixel CMOS camera sensor. The company states that the 48-megapixel f/1.8 camera can be used in two ways. It can shoot ultra-bright 12-megapixel photos with a process called as the 'pixel binning' - that combines four pixels worth of image into one.The second way is that it can be used to click photos with a resolution of 6,000 x 8,000 which results to very less amount of data when you zoom or crop a photo. The View20 has a secondary sensor called as the Time-of-Flight (TOF) which is a 3D scanner use for mapping objects in real time. The View 20 sports a laser-etched design that reflects a subtle V pattern on the back.Other specifications include a 7nm Kirin processor with 8GB RAM, a 4,000 mAh battery and storage options between 128GB and 256GB.It does carry a headphone jack. The phone has been launched in China starting at CNY 2,999 (~Rs 30,400) for the 6GB RAM + 128GB storage option and goes up to CNY 3,499 (~ Rs 35,500) for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage option."

title,Podcast | Digging Deeper: Does NFRA signal the death of ICAI as we know it?
datetime,2019-01-09 21:06:00+00:00
description,This death(?) of ICAI as we know it constitutes the topic of discussion on this episode of Digging Deeper with Moneycontrol.
content,"Most of us know chartered accountants as the guys who help us do our taxes - by “do,” I mean pay as little as possible of course. If we just paid the amount the government demanded in taxes, would we even require CAs?NoneICAI - the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India - is a statutory body that regulates Chartered Accountancy in India. Founded two years after independence, this institute falls under the administrative control of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs of the central government. Its official website claims it is the second largest professional body of CAs in the world.Anyway, the ICAI’s reputation is a bit tarnished these days. Why? Because the perception is that not enough has been done to rein in errant CAs whose actions have given the entire field a bad name. Matters deteriorated to the point that Prime Minister Narendra Modi took them to task in 2017.Speaking at the ICAI’s foundation-day even on July 1, 2017 (the ICAI was founded on July 1, 1949), Modi said, “CA is an arrangement in which the human resource development is done only by you. The curriculum is made by you only; you conduct the exam; rules and regulations are also made by you, and your institute only punishes the culprits.Now the question arises that the temple of democracy i.e. the Parliament of India, which is the voice of 125 crore countrymen, has given you so much authority, then why is it that in the last 11 years, only 25 charted accountants have been prosecuted? Did only 25 people make a mess? And I have heard that more than 1,400 cases are still pending for many years now. A single case takes years to settle…”NoneNone“An expert panel report, which not only voted for an independent regulator but also wanted to introduce competition in the institute’s non-regulatory functions, was released in late October 2017. This was followed by the notification of rules for the National Financial Reporting Authority (or NFRA) in November 2018. These ended ICAI’s oversight on auditors of listed entities and large unlisted companies. Under the new rules, the NFRA will have the power to monitor the auditors of listed entities, unlisted entities with paid-up capital of not less than Rs 500 crore or annual turnover of over Rs 1,000 crore or those having aggregate loans, debentures or deposits of not less than Rs 500 crore as on March 31 of the preceding financial year.”NoneBut it didn’t take long for matters to veer towards now-familiar accusations of overreach, if not outright evil conspiracy. One member who chose to remain anonymous said, “Like the way they want to take control of the RBI, they now want to take over CAs. If we would have been an ordinary association, it would have been a different situation. Any institution, which is established through an Act of Parliament, cannot be killed. You can regulate them, but you should not kill.”He also disapproved of the NFRA, which will be headed by a non-CA. He explained, “We are against the constitution of the NFRA itself. People who will now chair the NFRA are not experts in accounting or auditing. Right now, there is a retired IAS officer who will be the in-charge.”Retired IAS officer in-charge? Sounds familiar?What did ICAI do wrong?However much the ICAI may try to disparage the NFRA, it only ends up looking like it is desperately trying to deflect attention from its own fall from grace. Self-inflicted fall, as many have pointed out. Here’s why.As mentioned earlier, the ICAI was formed by an Act of Parliament in 1949. Over the years, the institute became synonymous with the profession of accountancy and audit. It wore multiple hats - an industry association, an educational body, and a regulatory and disciplinary authority.For example: I am certain that you all have that one friend who is working his backside off trying to pass what we call in common parlance, the CA exam - otherwise known as the CPT or Common Proficiency Test. After that comes the 3-year Articleship where our friends sacrifice all sleep for the aforementioned three-year-period. After that, they move to the Middle East and make tons of money, while we no longer smirk at them. It’s the hard-fought good life, if you will. So how did they go and mess it all up?NoneIn FY17, ICAI had 2,18,319 registered students across various stages. The disciplinary function of the institute involves a two-tier mechanism - a board of discipline, and a disciplinary committee that looks into specific types of misconduct. The law lists various types of offences that qualify as misconduct. The First Schedule deals with misconduct by practising CAs, while the Second Schedule deals with those related to CAs in service. First Schedule offences are overseen by the board of discipline.The disciplinary committee, on the other hand, has a broader mandate. But what has proven frustrating over the years is the repeated back and forth between the committee/board and the council. The maximum punishment is striking off a member from the members’ register for five years. If the council thinks the person has to be restrained for a longer period, it has to refer the matter to a high court.NoneICAI has taken some heat for its soft approach towards its accused CAs. The newspaper DNA reported that an official of Ministry of Corporate Affairs said, “ICAI has almost failed to take any disciplinary action against accused CAs who are involved in fraudulent activities and bypassed auditing rules. These will now come under NFRA.”NoneUnsurprisingly, its annual report mentions the prime minister’s presence at its 2017 foundation-day celebrations but avoids all references to his message we mentioned at the start of this podcast.On one occasion, an affected investor had moved the high court to force the ICAI to take action against an erring auditor. The investor said,  “...(the) CA institute is yet to take disciplinary action against auditors”. In 2015, a Business Standard report spoke about a case against the auditor of the now defunct Global Trust Bank that had dragged on for over 10 years.NoneNoneIn all these cases, the auditors were found to be not guilty. In November 2015, the Ministry had referred cases of 132 listed companies for examining the role of auditor and possible misconduct. These companies were suspended by Sebi for price manipulation. According to MCA, preliminary action was not initiated by the ICAI ‘despite several reminders’.NonePavan K Vijay, former president of the ICAI, says, “The issue with the institutes was the disciplinary process. The institutes are governed by an elected council. Elected members refrained from taking action against people who voted for them. If the council is divided, then there is no action. If one group within the council is stronger, then disproportionate action is taken against another group. Thus, the system has become so dirty — on the one hand there is inaction, and on the other there is vindictiveness.”And that is cue for the NFRA to step in. What is NFRA?In the wake of the Satyam Computer scandal, the Companies Act of 2013 provided for an independent regulatory body in the form of the NFRA. The ICAI has been less than enthused by the NFRA right from its inception. The continued opposition to the establishment of the NFRA has delayed its implementation. Though the act was enacted in August 2013, the establishing of the NFRA was notified only in March last year!Let’s take a minute here to understand the NFRA. The central cabinet approved the creation of a National Financial Reporting Authority -NFRA- in March 2018. It was deemed a major step forward in the regulation of the financial audit of large companies. The NFRA will serve as an independent regulator overseeing the auditing profession, somewhat akin to SEBI for the stock markets.The Cabinet also approved the creation of the posts within the regulator — that of a chairman, three full-time members, and one secretary. Former bureaucrat R Sridharan was named the first chairperson of the NFRA.The formal description of the NFRA, as we said earlier, goes something like this: It will have the power to monitor and enforce compliance with accounting standards and auditing standards, oversee the quality of service and undertake investigation of the auditors of listed entities; unlisted entities with paid-up capital of not less than Rs 500 crore or annual turnover of over Rs 1,000 crore or those having aggregate loans, debentures or deposits of not less than Rs 500 crore as of March 31 of the preceding financial year.What will the NFRA actually do? It will maintain details of particulars of auditors appointed by companies; recommend accounting and auditing standards for approval by the Central government; monitor and enforce compliance with accounting standards and auditing standards. It will also oversee the quality of service of the professions associated with ensuring compliance with such standards and suggest measures for improvement in quality of service.The NFRA can investigate professional matters or misconduct of any member or a firm of chartered accountants; it can issue summons and examine on oath; it can also inspect any book, registers and documents of any professional/firms probed; it may impose penalties and even powers to debar a member of a firm.The establishment of the NFRA means that CAs will now be supervised or audited - policing the police, if you will. Every auditor will file I-T returns with the Authority on or before April 30 of every year. Understandably, ICAI, which has functioned pretty much unfettered for nearly 70 years, is resisting this step.NoneNoneIn late October, a committee of experts appointed by the MCA as per the instructions of the Supreme Court, supported the strengthening of the NFRA and suggested that competition be introduced to the educational and development functions of the ICAI.Other major economies of the world, after experiencing corporate scandals and accounting frauds, put in place independent regulatory mechanisms. In the US, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) functions as an independent audit regulator overseeing the audits of public companies.The famous Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is the oversight authority of the PCAOB and can take action against an auditor for professional misconduct or violation of securities laws. The PCAOB sets standards for auditing, quality control, ethics, and independence. It is further vested with investigative and disciplinary powers and can also revoke registration and impose monetary penalties on auditors.The UK has a two-tier structure, which has an independent audit regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), and multiple SROs. The critical regulatory activities concerning auditors of public-interest entities are vested with the FRC, while other tasks have been delegated to multiple SROs.China regulates auditing through three authorities — the finance ministry, the China Security Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA).None What now?J.N. Gupta, MD and co-founder at proxy advisory firm Stakeholder Empowerment Services, said, “While NFRA should have come sooner, the body should also look at company secretaries who are currently governed by Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) as they have an equally important role to play in examining rule compliance.”NoneHe added, “For the NFRA to be effective, it should consist of independent experts with an impeccable record of integrity. Persons elected to ICAI’s council should be kept out...The NFRA should keep its distance from the ICAI. Otherwise, it will be yet another case of regulatory capture.”"

description,"With tremendous appreciation and massive success, the R15 has redefined the 150CC segment in India."
content,"Yamaha launched its flagship bike, YZF- R15 V3 with dual channel ABS today. This makes the R15 the only motorcycle in its segment to have such a feature. With tremendous appreciation and massive success, the R15 has redefined the 150CC segment in India.Here's why:1. Segment creatorYamaha has not only given the world a great learner’s motorcycle, but it has also practically created the sports bike segment in 150 CC. Before 2008, there was no serious consideration for a single cylinder, low capacity performance motorcycle. But after the launch of YZF R15 version 1, the world became aware of the possibilities of a stylish, cheap yet performance-oriented option to the otherwise heavy, expensive and risky superbikes.2. Unique designThe aerodynamic profile, low-slung clip on, rear set footpegs and an overall tucked in stance put the R15 in the league of high performance, track-oriented motorcycles. This, combined with the latest technologies and updates that Yamaha has showered the R15 with, has made R15 a potent track tool, as well as a practical everyday bike.3. VVAVariable Valve Actuation, or VVA, is a valve timing technology, which helps the engine produce more power. With the introduction of VVA in the third iteration of R15, which is also the first time in its segment, Yamaha has bumped up the power from 15 horses to 19.4 BHP. Yum!4. Advanced engineeringIt is most commonly acknowledged that the YZF R15 is a pinnacle of engineering and automobile innovation. Right from the first generation to the latest V3.0, R15 has proved time and again that you do not need a bigger engine to go faster. Boasting of impressive track and street records, the R15 is a force to be reckoned with.5. Legendary LineageThe YZF R15 comes from the YZF line of motorcycles, which are directly evolved from the YZR series used in MotoGP, and consists of bikes like the R1, R1M and R6, which are widely considered as the pinnacle of modern-day motorcycle technology.6.

title,Quick Take | Paper sector gets largest FDI ever; should Street cheer?

description,"With total investment of roughly Rs 24,000 crore ($3.5 billion) , Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) to set up India’s largest paper mill  with a capacity of a staggering five million tonnes per annum"
content,"Moneycontrol ResearchIndonesian paper company Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with The Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB) on January 9 to set up India’s largest paper mill in the state with a capacity of a staggering five million tonnes per annum. The total investment of roughly Rs 24,000 crore ($3.5 billion) makes it one of the largest foreign direct investments (FDI) in recent times. While this is definitely a big positive for the country, we try to decipher the repercussions it can have for the sector and leading paper companies.Implications for existing playersWith a market size of around 17.1 million tonnes as of end-FY18, India has been the fastest growing paper market globally, and has expanded at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3 percent over 10 years.Thanks to increased demand from FMCG and packaged food segment as well as rapidly growing e-commerce (likes of Amazon and Flipkart), domestic paper demand (especially packaging paper) remains buoyant. At the same time, supply constraints remain following the closure of stressed domestic capacities (Ballarpur Industries), benefiting large domestic players.The paper industry has not added any significant capacities over the last three to four years. As a result, most paper companies are currently operating at around 85 - 90 percent capacity utilisation level, while the larger companies are operating close to or over 100 percent.NoneLarge players like JK Paper, International Paper APPM have so far reaped benefits of the positive demand-supply scenario. While they are beneficiaries of a sector upturn, they also remain vulnerable to new capacity additions. APP’s future capacity additions obviously will have an impact on the supply-demand and competitive intensity of the industry. Though it will take few years for APP to hit the market, its production ramp-up could adversely impact prices and margins of incumbents in future.Implication on incremental investments Significant investments have been lined up by some of the large domestic players for capacity expansion. A bulk of these additions are in the packaging paper & board segment as high growth rate is anticipated there.NoneA majority of the recently-announced capacity expenditure (capex) plans are scheduled for completion after April 2020. The bunching up of capacity additions if not commensurate with the demand growth could weaken the financial profile (debt servicing capability) of the players that have announced expansion plans. The lumpy capacity additions planned by APP can exert downward pressure on profitability and can result in a subdued performance for the sector in future.We don’t see any near term impact on the sector due to the long gestation period involved in capacity addition. While impossible to comprehend at this point in time, APP’s huge capacity set up plans will certainly alter sector dynamics in future.Follow @nehadave01"

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2019, the trend gets better with Lapscreen, a sub-13-inch monitor that you can take anywhere because it is unbelievably thin!The display measures 11.1-inches by 8.3-inches, which also includes the larger chin that houses a USB Type-C port and an HDMI port. The Lapscreen comprises of a single USB Type-C port that can be used for connecting to your phone or laptop. The most unbelievable part of the display is the thickness — 4mm. That is as thin as a sheet of paper. Even the chin that houses the ports is comparatively thinner than other displays at just 8mm. The display is a standard full HD panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080p. The single port USB can be used for both, power and data transfer. The complete panel weighs less than 400 grams.NoneThough the thickness challenges the technology to do better, there are a few problems with this display. Because the screen is incredibly 4mm thick, there is no option for a stand behind the display panel. Even a pop-up stand found on many phone cases could have been enough to keep the display upright. The other issue is the price and availability."

title,Private healthcare players welcome government sops to set up hospitals

description,"“At the current package rates offered under Ayushman Bharat, it is not viable to put up hospitals in these places, viability gap funding (VGF) and cross-subsidisation are the way to go,” said Ranjan Pai of Manipal Hospitals."
content,"The healthcare industry welcomed the guidelines issued by the Central government that assured sops such as land, clearances, tax breaks and funding to set up hospitals in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, to support Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) or Ayushman Bharat.""It is a good move, they have to encourage hospitals to come up in tier-2 and tier-3 towns,"" said Ranjan Pai, Chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG) that runs Manipal Hospitals.The government on January 8 said it will allocate land, facilitate permissions and clearances, in addition to compulsory empanelment of the hospitals for PMJAY, timely payments for services, viability gap funding up to 40 percent of the total cost of the project and gap funding up to 50 percent of tax on capital cost.The government also assured restoration of the status of a hospital as the industry for getting the benefit of VGF.“At the current package rates offered under Ayushman Bharat, it is not viable to put up hospitals in these places, viability gap funding (VGF) and cross-subsidization are the way to go,"" Pai said.In a cross-subsidized model, the private hospital will be allowed to charge patients who can afford to pay, in order to sustain operations and make profit, even while servicing patients under Ayushman Bharat at low prices.On industry status for hospitals, Pai said hospitals are already operating as corporations.“This may allow them to access long term funding at cheaper rates, but we are expecting more clarity on this,” Pai added.Ayushman Bharat provides hospitalisation cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year to over 10 crore poor families in the empanelled hospitals throughout the country.With the scheme providing health coverage to 40 percent of country’s population, it is expected to create a huge demand for secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities that are mostly concentrated in metro cities.India has over 23,000 hospitals with around seven lakh beds, and is targeting to reach 3.6 million beds by 2034.“To really realize the potential of Ayushman Bharat, we need to think about sustainable capacity creation to serve that programme, which doesn’t exist today,” said Pushpa Vijayaraghavan, Director & Practice Lead - Healthcare, Sathguru Management Consultants.Looks the government finally realized this, she added.Vijayaraghavan said if the incentives are implemented in right earnest, it will take at least three to four years to see addition of meaningful capacity.There are others who have expressed concern over government pushing private hospitals without regulating them properly.“We have seen several examples of private hospitals, even after taking land and other incentives, failed to deliver services to people at transparent prices,” said Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator of Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD), the body representing domestic medical devices companies."

content,"NoneSales under the brand BharatBenz, which was created specifically for India, stood at 20,500 units during January-November as against 15,200 units in the same period last year. DICV sells trucks only in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment.The company’s market share marginally improved to 5.86 percent during the reporting period as compared to 5.8 percent. The industry grew 33 percent without DICV to 3.29 lakh units during January-November. DICV’s 35 percent growth last year is higher than the 28 percent clocked in 2017.DICV does not share its sales or production numbers with the auto industry’s apex lobby body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). DICV makes tippers, tractor trailers, haulage trucks and intra-city buses.NoneIn comparison, Tata Motors' sales grew 35.57 percent to 1.7 lakh units,  and that of Ashok Leyland went up 28.5 percent to 1.06 lakh units in January-November.MilestoneDaimler Trucks also reached the milestone in September 2018 with the production of its 100,000th vehicle at the Chennai plant. In addition to BharatBenz trucks for the local market, the plant in Chennai also manufactures models for export to more than 40 markets worldwide.Established in 2009, DICV makes trucks and buses having tonnage range of 9-49 tonnes under the BharatBenz and Mercedes-Benz brands. Its Chennai-based factory spread over 400 acres, has seen an investment of more than Rs 5,000 crore.The consistent rise in market share and volumes of DICV comes on the back of the exit of MAN last year, a Volkswagen group company, from India after years of fruitless operation. MAN’s sister company Scania followed suit when it said it is exiting the bus body building operation in India.“No other western manufacturer than Daimler has successfully become established in India so far,"" added Daimler in the statement.The upcoming Bharat Stage VI emission norm is putting a strain on the finances of all truck and bus manufacturers. BS-VI, which will be in force from April 1, 2020, will likely result in a 10-12 percent jump in prices of CVs translating to a rise of more than Rs 3 lakh."

title,Availing a loan for your marriage? Keep these key points in mind
datetime,2019-01-10 17:28:00+00:00
description,"Compare wedding loan offers from multiple banks and NBFCs then choose the offer that most suits you. There can be significant savings in interest, processing fees and other charges by comparing and choosing the loan scheme carefully"
content,"Millennials are keen to have a spectacular wedding for themselves but don’t generally look at its impact on their financials and future goals. We have one such instance of 26-year-old Nikunj Soni, an Ahmedabad resident who took a loan for his wedding in January 2017 from a nationalised bank.NoneHowever, due to this burden of the loan, he is now paying monthly EMI of Rs 4,758 and in two years, up until now, has paid Rs 1.14 lakh (approximately).By end of the tenure, he will end up paying Rs 2.85 lakh. Additional, Rs 85,000 (approximately) is interest on the borrowed amount. Upon seeing his financial burden, Soni realised that perhaps he shouldn’t have taken this loan.“I could have started a SIP to build contingency fund with this amount (instead of the EMI) for my ageing parents or invested for future goals instead of servicing this EMI for five years. I made a financial blunder by borrowing for the wedding”, he says.NoneThis excludes additional expenses of honeymoon that adds Rs 2 to 4 lakh due to an international trip as the first preference by millennial couples.When it comes to paying for the wedding, 42 percent wedding couples intend to contribute along with help from their parents, 32 percent prefer if their parents pay for the extravaganza, and 26 percent said they would like to pay solely from their own savings, as per the survey.With wedding costs that high, an online survey in March 2017 from Tata Capital, the financial services arm of the Tata Group, revealed that a majority—58 percent of those surveyed—considered taking a wedding loan, to partly or fully finance wedding expenses.In this survey, close to 2,500 respondents, including married, single and to-be-married individuals, were interviewed.Millennials seem to believe wedding loans are a convenient and easy way to finance wedding by borrowing from banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) or online fintech companies (includes peer-to-peer platforms).Let’s see how these wedding loans work, pros and drawbacks of this loan, alternate ways to pay for your wedding and more.NoneWedding loan is a form of a personal loan that is to be avoidedWedding loan is a part of the vast umbrella of varied personal loans offered by financial institutions and fintech companies. Some of the financial institutions offer standalone “wedding loan” scheme.However, in case you don’t find the wedding loan scheme in your bank brochure still, you can take a personal loan and specify the reason as wedding while borrowing.NoneGaurav Gupta, co-founder and CEO of the online aggregator of financial products and services MyLoanCare.in said, “Typically banks may lend up to 22 times of the net take-home monthly salary of the borrower as wedding loan.”Other eligibility parameters include age, minimum net take-home salary, credit score, reputation and size of the company working for and residence stability. In case, the borrower has a good credit history and score, the lender will offer a wedding loan with an apt interest rate analysing the profile of a borrower.Sapna Tiwari, Co-Founder and COO, Rupeewiz Investment Advisors said, “Using a loan for wedding isn’t advisable. Since it’s the most expensive way to get married. Immediately after marriage, you’ll start paying interest cost on the money borrowed which may be a burden.”Millennials and their family feel an extravagant wedding is necessary due to pressure from society, friends and family. Rachit Chawla, Founder and CEO of lending and investment advisory platform Finway said, “A wedding loan should only be preferred when the borrower has no financial obligations to pay from the past and is fully able to pay it off completely in the loan tenure.”Tiwari suggested, “Before going into a debt trap with wedding loan to afford your dream day, consider cutting costs and bring your wedding expenses in line with your budget.”Bank charges hefty pre-payment penaltyTypically financial institutions have a lock-in period of six months to one year in wedding loan/personal loan for wedding purpose. Prepayment of the loan is possible after lock-in period and bank charges prepayment penalties on early repayment. For instance, ICICI Bank has a lock-in of six months and prepayment charges are 5 percent. These charges can differ from bank to bank.Gupta said, “In case, marriage gets cancelled after taking a wedding loan for any particular reason, and borrower chooses to repay the outstanding loan. She will also have to incur prepayment penalty charges as defined by the bank at the time of taking a loan.”Not all financial institutions and fintech charge for prepayment from the borrowers. This includes Axis bank, fintech such as LenDenClub, Faircent, MoneyTap, etc.Avoid taking a joint loan for weddingA peer-to-peer lending firm, LenDenClub calculates eligibility based on the income of both husband and wife for a wedding loan. It may help them to get a higher amount in wedding loan for the marriage.However, financial advisors don’t recommend to take such joint wedding loan. Because you may end up taking a higher amount for a wedding that may not be affordable in future. Further, jointly if you can’t repay the monthly instalment regularly then it impacts the credit history of both the borrowers. Also, borrowing in future for house or car may be difficult.Key factors to keep in mind while applying for a loanEstimate the amount of equated monthly instalments you can comfortably service considering your existing savings and monthly income. Compare wedding loan offers from multiple banks and NBFCs then choose the offer that most suits you. There can be significant savings in interest, processing fees and other charges by comparing and choosing the loan scheme carefully.In case, you plan to apply for a wedding loan despite knowing the drawbacks as discussed, then look at leading private or public sector banks since they offer loans at attractive interest rates compared to NBFCs and peer-to-peer lenders.Gupta said, “Loans from NBFCs and peer-to-peer come at fairly high interest rates as compared to that of banks because these lenders charge a risk premium to lend to the borrowers.”Few alternatives to escape wedding loanBy presenting our expert opinions, we have already spoiled your grand wedding plans with loans. Just because loans are on offer, doesn’t mean you should take one.A wedding may be a dream but it shouldn’t result in a debt burden. On account of that and the fact that these loans are expensive, Moneycontrol does not recommend wedding loans. Here’s how you can make alternative arrangements to ensure you have enough cash to have a good wedding.-Cut the wedding costMillennials should use innovations to cut down their wedding cost if it’s going beyond budgeted expenses.Sanna Vohra, Founder and CEO of online wedding planning services firm, The Wedding Brigade suggested some ideas to reduce costs, “This includes online booking of big-ticket vendors by comparing their offerings and packages (for catering, photography, decoration, etc.), online shopping or renting of wedding outfits, sending online invitations to guests, and more.""-Invest smartly for your weddingIn case you have a couple of years for your marriage, then build a corpus by investing in financial assets like debt funds or corporate fixed deposits which are giving decent interest rates at present.“If, your wedding goal is more than three years away then prefer investing in large-cap or multi-cap mutual fund schemes. However, avoid equity mutual fund schemes if wedding goal is under three years since it's a risky asset class,” said Harshil Morjaria, Mumbai-based certified financial planner of ValueCurve Financial Solutions."

description,UAE moved top of the table in Group A with 4 points from 2 matches while second-placed India still remained in the hunt for a knockout berth with 3 points.
content,"India left their scoring boots and luck behind while hosts United Arab Emirates found both after a subdued opener to record a 2-0 win in the AFC Asian Cup at UAE on January 10. Khalfan Mubarak (41') Ali Ahmed Mabkhout (88') scored for the home team, entering the game in some desperation after a 1-1 stalemate with Bahrain in the tournament opener.UAE moved top of the table in Group A with four points from two matches while second-placed India still remained in the hunt for a knockout berth with three points from two outings.India had drubbed Thailand 4-1 in their opening encounter but the Thais got their campaign back on a track with a 1-0 win over Bahrain in the evening fixture.India made a positive start in both the halves and created many chances, but paid dearly for lacking the finishing touch.The Blue Tigers missed three big chances in the first half and while they created opportunities after the break too, India were denied on two occasions by the framework.On expected lines, the United Arab Emirates enjoyed possession initially but, to the surprise of many, India had more shots at goal and dominated proceedings by keeping the opposition defence busy.Sandesh Jhingan's free header off a corner by Anirudh Thapa, which was won by Pritam Kotal, went off target. India could have been 1-0 up as early as the seventh minute at the Zayed Sports City Stadium.Then, unmarked at the far post, Sunil Chhetri's header after Thapa squared it for the second highest active goal-scorer in international football, was brilliantly saved by UAE custodian Khalid Eisa.If those misses in the eighth and 23rd minute gave India the belief that they will be able to fight their fancied opponents, in coach Stephen Constantine's words, toe-to-toe, they also may have made the Blue Tigers a bit restless.And UAE, positioned 18 places above the 97th ranked India in the FIFA chart, used that to their advantage when Mubarak charged forward and latched on to a ball by Ali Ahmed Mabkhout, who ran in from the right.It was not that the Indian defence was in disarray but they would have done well to clear the ball at first instance. Thapa, the team's youngest member at 20, could not get there in time while Anas Edathodika and Jhingan also could not come in the way of Mubarak, who scored his first international goal.Entering the game after a 1-1 stalemate with Bahrain, UAE required full points, and the relief was palpable in their camp when Mubarak broke the deadlock.The joy would have been short-lived for the home team had the talismanic Chhetri's attempt not missed the target by a whisker in the 43rd minute, this after the Indian captain had the UAE defenders in splits and managed to cut one through one of the gaps with Eisa nowhere in the picture.Down by a goal at the break, India were not to be disheartened and made their intentions clear in the second half.Constantine brought in Jeje Lalpekhlua in place of Halicharan Narzary and the Mizo forward, who scored two minutes after coming off the bench in the 4-1 mauling of Thailand, nearly did an encore in the 53rd minute. Jeje's volley went inches off the post.Three minutes later, India again experienced the so-near-yet-so-far moment when Udanta Singh's shot ricochets off the bar."

content,"NoneIn its 35th year of uninterrupted production, the Omni will be replaced by its bigger and much younger cousin Eeco, confirmed a top official of Maruti Suzuki speaking to Moneycontrol.“Omni would not be upgraded to meet the next generation norms,” said RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki. On how Maruti plans to compensate the void in sales volumes, Bhargava said, “Eeco sale are going up and it is a similar vehicle.""Government rules make it mandatory for all cars to sport at least one driver airbag, a speed warning system, a seatbelt reminder for driver and co-driver and rear parking sensors as standard from July 1, 2019.This will be followed by a requirement to upgrade all existing models to meet the crash test norms from October 1, 2019. Thereafter, six months later or April 1, 2020, India will embrace Bharat Stage VI, the latest emission norm in the world.All these will put significant cost pressure, forcing companies to phase out some models. While it will be easy for some companies to phase out laggards, for Maruti Suzuki it will be a tough call.The Omni, after all, sells an average of more than 7,000 a month, which is more than the entire bouquet of models that smaller companies with 4-6 product offerings each such as Renault, Nissan, Volkswagen, Skoda and Fiat have in India.The five-seater Omni will cause a dent in Maruti Suzuki’s sales as not every customer will move to the Eeco because of the price gap. The base version of the Omni is priced at Rs 2.85 lakh while the base version of the Eeco (five-seater version) is priced at Rs 3.37 lakh (both prices ex-showroom, Delhi). Alto 800 remains the cheapest car in Maruti’s stable priced at Rs 2.66 lakh.The Omni has served a variety of customers in its decade-long career. While the minivan vanished from the garages of several urban customers it has continued to service the taxi fleet in big and Tier-II cities.In other cities and towns, the Omni has remained the top choice of customers with big families and those running small businesses."

description,The Three White Soldiers pattern can appear after an extended downtrend or a period of consolidation.
content,"Narnolia Financial AdvisorsThere are more useful and regular patterns of three candlesticks which have been identified as a very important for price action trading and trend reversals namely Three White Soldiers Pattern, Morning Star Pattern, Three Black Crows Pattern and Abandoned Baby Pattern. Here, the trading signal is generated based on three day’s trading action.Three White Soldiers PatternDefinitionA three white soldiers pattern occurs in the candlestick chart of a financial instrument when a strong green candle manages to closes above high of the prior candle, consecutively for two candles, forming strong three white candles. This pattern usually occurs during a down trend and is thought to signal the beginning of a bullish trend in the stock, commodity or currency.NoneIdentification Criteria• The green body is formed on the second & third day has managed to close above high of the body of the prior day.ValidationThe Three White Soldiers pattern can appear after an extended downtrend or a period of consolidation. On the first day, the market opens lower in the direction of the existing downtrend. The next or second candlestick in the pattern is another bullish or long white candlestick, having a body slightly larger than the first candlestick. This second candlestick also needs to have little to no shadow and closing should be above high of prior candle. The last or third candlestick is another bullish candlestick that needs to be equal or greater length of a body than the second candlestick and closing should be above second body’s high.When all three candlesticks appear as per validation, this chart pattern can be used to confirm the end of down trend and start of a new uptrend.Morning Star PatternDefinitionThis is a triple candlestick pattern indicating a bottom out and trend reversal to uptrend. It is composed of a dark candlestick followed by a short candlestick, which opens lower to form a star.NoneIdentification Criteria• The white body is formed on the third day, and it has managed to close inside or above first day’s black candle.ValidationA downtrend is in progress and the formation of a black candlestick on the first day confirms the ongoing of the downward trend. The appearance of the short candlestick with a bearish gap on the following day indicates that bears are still active and prices are getting pushed downside. However, the narrow price movement on the second day indicates indecision and creates a doubt in bear’s mind about existing down trend and its strength. The third day is a white body candlestick where price closes well into the first day’s black body.This pattern indicates reversal in trend, however strong move comes once price closes above first day’s black body’s high. Similar to Morning Star Pattern is Evening Star Pattern that indicates change in market from bullish to bearish.Three Black Crows PatternDefinitionThree black crows indicate a topping out pattern in the financial market. It is characterized by three red candlesticks moving downwards; however the opening of each day is slightly higher than previous close and prices progressively close at lower levels. This pattern usually occurs during an uptrend and is thought to signal the beginning of a bearish trend in the stock, commodity or currency.NoneIdentification Criteria• The black body is formed on the second & third day has managed to close below low of the prior day.ValidationEach of the three candlesticks in the Three Black Crows pattern should be relatively long bearish candlesticks with each candlestick closing at or near the low price for the day. This brings a sense of fear among the bulls who now consider closing their long positions causing prices to head lower. The confirmation level is defined as the third candles close. Prices should cross below this level for a sell signal to be generated.Abandoned Baby PatternDefinitionThe abandoned baby is a rare, but reliable, candlestick pattern that is useful in alerting traders to a possible trend change to the upside. The abandoned baby candlestick formation is a three bar reversal pattern that is similar to the morning and evening star formations and is a very reliable reversal signal when it occurs after a sharp drop; it is also called as “Sute Go” in Japanese.NoneIdentification Criteria• However bullish gap is formed in 2nd candle’s upper shadow and third body’s lower shadow.Validation"

description,"So far the company raised Rs 200 crore funding from investors such as International Finance Corporation, SeaLink Capital Partners and Bessemer Venture Capital."
content,"NephroPlus, which runs India's largest chain of dialysis centres, plans to raise about Rs 150 crore to fund international expansion by May 2019.In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol NephroPlus Founder and CEO, Vikram Vuppala said the company plans to open 20 dialysis centres in the Middle East and South East Asia.The company has raised Rs 200 crore funding so far from investors such as International Finance Corporation, SeaLink Capital Partners and Bessemer Venture Capital.""While we are not compromising on India growth story, we are trying to create an impact on other emerging economies, with low reimbursement setting like India; that's the challenge we are undertaking,"" Vuppala said.NephroPlus acquired Indian operations of the world’s second largest kidney care-provider DaVita for an undisclosed sum in November 2018. DaVita has 22 centres in two cities with over 1,700 dialysis patients and Rs 50 crore in turnover.The acquisition of DaVita took Nephroplus' network to 183 dialysis centres across 100 cities and 18 states.The company operates around 137 dialysis centres outsourced by private hospitals, 37 in public-private partnership (PPP) and nine standalone.Vuppala said many private hospitals have realised they weren't making money on dialysis, as volumes were low with cost structures. They started outsourcing operations of these centres to specialised players like NephroPlus.NephroPlus is frugal and uses advantage of scale to negotiate prices for procurement of medical consumables, machines and maintenance. They also rely on technology and automation. For example, the water treatment plants at NephroPlus use specialised sensors to collect data about the flow rate, the hardness of the water and other metrics. By keeping the hardness of the water low, they reduce the risk of damaging dialysis membranes and the sensors alert operations team, if maintenance is due. They also provide centralized dietitian services via Skype and also get higher output from nephrologists.NephroPlus, which was in existence for nearly a decade, broke even only three years ago when it hit volumes of 60,000 dialysis treatments per month. Now the network clocks 1.25 lakh dialysis treatments and is growing at around 35 percent.Vuppala said they are still scratching the surface, as the dialysis market size is just $300 million in India, while its potential is around $2 billion.The company plans to add 30-40 centres every year. It costs upwards of Rs 1 crore to set up a state-of-the-art dialysis centre in India.Vuppala, who worked with global consulting firm McKinsey, co-founded NephroPlus in 2009 along with partner Kamal Shah, a dialysis patient himself. Shah faced difficulties in finding quality dialysis centres and sensed the huge unmet need.""We decided we wanted to create a dialysis network that didn’t treat patients as commodities,"" Vuppala said.Death punishment and PPPsDialysis is an artificial process to filter harmful wastes, salt, and excess fluid from blood for people suffering from the last stages of kidney failure.According to data, over 200,000 patients with end-stage kidney disease get added in India every year due to rising chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. But this demand is only half met in the country with less than 5,000 dialysis centres.It costs a patient around Rs 250,000 - 300,000 excluding drugs to get dialysis treatment per annum. While group insurance schemes cover dialysis, standalone schemes exempt dialysis.The end-stage kidney disease is often a death penalty for most Indians, Vuppala said.Realising this, the Central government announced the Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme, under which all the district hospitals will have a dialysis unit, operated under public-private partnership (PPP) mode. The patients will be offered free dialysis, and the Centre will fund the treatment cost in the initial years, while states will operate the scheme.NephroPlus has been running around 37 dialysis centres under PPP mode. It has signed PPP agreements with Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It also runs dialysis centres in PPP for Employees' State Insurance Corporation, Neyveli Lignite and Singareni Colleries.But Vuppala said they are keeping away from PPP projects."

description,"The company received a boost of 2,580 new orders from three state-owned transport corporations valued at Rs 300-390 crore"
content,"NoneOn January 9, the company received 2,580 new orders from three state-owned transport corporations collectively valued at Rs 300-390 crore.“Last year, the STU numbers were 8,400 and our market share stood at 35 percent. This year, we are expecting the total STU orders to close at 10,500 with our market share reaching 50 percent,” Sanjay Saraswat, Head-Global Buses, Ashok Leyland told Moneycontrol.The Hinduja group’s flagship firm bagged orders from Institute of Road Transport Chennai, Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and Chandigarh Transport Undertaking. These orders have to be fulfilled by the end of March 2019.There has been a revival in orders of buses from STUs this year compared to last year. The share of STUs in total bus market is expected to go up to 26 percent by end of March as against 23 percent last financial year.The traditional market share of STUs in the total bus pie of India had been at 25-6 percent. It was even higher ten years ago when the transport routes were controlled exclusively by the state undertakings. After the privatisation of STUs overall demand from them dropped.“Over a period of time, purchases from STUs were coming down. But this year the number has gone up. It stood at 12,300 units in 2016-17 then it went down to 8,400 units last year and this year it has picked up again,” Saraswat said."

title,Gold available at 10% discount - should you buy?
datetime,2019-01-11 15:47:00+00:00
description,The opportunity is in the form of buying sovereign gold bond (SGB) from the secondary market.
content,"Traditionally Indians are known to be consumers of gold. Be it jewellery or bullion gold, there has always been demand for gold, keep aside phases when it dipped occasionally.Gold emerged as the best asset class with 7% returns in the year ended December 31, 2018 leaving behind Nifty 50 with 3.13% returns and short term bond funds that gave 6% returns.If this recent performance is not enough to create interest in gold buying, how about a minimum 10% discount on gold price while buying? 24 carat Gold quoted at Rs 33454 for 10 gram in spot market. What if you would have got an opportunity to invest in gold at a price as low as Rs 28220?The opportunity is in the form of buying sovereign gold bond (SGB) from the secondary market. These bonds are trading at a massive discount to the prevailing gold price. For example, SGB maturing in November 2025 (bearing symbol SGBDEC2512) traded at Rs 2822 on National Stock Exchange. This amounts to a discount of 15%.Before you jump to key in the buy order understand the investment proposition involved. For beginners, SGB are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of Government of India and track the price of one gram gold.In each issuance, RBI specifies the price of the bond at the time of issuance. The bond comes with eight years term and after five years the investors have the option to opt for early encashment.The best thing about this bond is it fetches interest income to the investor at the rate of 2.5% per year. The interest pay-out on offer makes it a compelling buy for gold investors, as no other way an investor can earn any income from gold.“For long term investors not looking for intermittent liquidity, SGB is a better investment option over gold ETF as the SGB offers interest income and there is almost no cost involved in holding these bonds. Gold ETFs though offer liquidity, do not offer any income and do charge investors in the form of expense ratio,” says Anil Rego, founder of Right Horizons – a financial advisory firm.The SGBs are listed on the stock exchanges and one can trade in them if held in demat accounts. At the time of redemption, the bonds will fetch the price of gold to the investor. To make it further compelling, there is no capital gains tax payable by the investor if the bonds are held till maturity.However, if you choose to sell before redemption, then the gains are taxed as long term capital gains if held for three years or more at the rate of 20% post indexation. The short term capital gains are taxed at a marginal rate of tax.Prateek Pant, co-founder and head of product and solutions at Sanctum Wealth Management says, “We have a neutral view on gold since gold does not generate any cashflow for the investors. If you want to buy gold from the asset allocation point of view, then it will be prudent to buy it through the sovereign gold bond.”NoneYou must be wondering by now, if all is so good about SGBs then why are they available at a massive discount?“Though SGBs are attractive means to take exposure to gold, they are not liquid in the secondary market given low investor interest,” says Anil Rego.A look at the trading volume of the SGB on the stock exchanges connotes the same. The most active series of SGB records volumes in few hundreds on a given day. Most series record volumes in double digits. That is very low for efficient price discovery. Low demand for SGBs lead to low volumes and low prices. No wonder the sellers have to settle for a price much lower than the prevailing price.Most investors may undermine this element while buying SGBs. However, it will have a big bearing on your investment return. “If you cannot hold on to your investments in SGBs and the liquidity remains low then you have to sell the SGB at a discount,” says Anil Rego.That means you cannot pocket the discount you get at the time of buying the SGB. The mispriced security will remain mispriced.NoneCan the mispricing correct?One needs to understand that the mispricing is arising out of poor liquidity. The poor liquidity is an outcome of low investor interest and low investor interest is an outcome of the dull show posted by gold over the past few years. Over past five years, gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - another financial means to invest in gold - gave 0.9% returns to investors. Gold ETFs have seen net outflow of Rs 305 crore since April 1, 2018, as per data provided by Association of Mutual Funds in India.“No one would like to hazard a guess about if and when the secondary market for SGB will turn liquid. If the gold prices see a significant up move outperforming all other asset classes by a wide margin, then the investors may come back to SGB and the discount at which they quote in the secondary market may shrink or even disappear,” says a fund manager who wished not be quoted.“If you want to invest in SGB, you should be prepared to hold till maturity,” says Prateek Pant. As the SGB nears the maturity date, the discount to the spot gold price should shrink gradually. At the time of maturity, the investor will be paid the prevailing price of gold. Holding till maturity also ensures that you do not pay tax on long term capital gains if any.If you are a long term investor in gold then this should appeal you. For short term tactical investors, gold ETF may make sense. If you intend to go for SGB in the secondary market, follow the price discipline. You have to buy in small lots given the low liquidity. One large buy order will do away discount."

description,Successful relaunches of key products of the company -- ADHO and No Marks -- along with better rural offtake have been the salient takeaways from the result
content,"NoneNoneNoneAnother key product for the company, No Marks’ restage has also been successful, with sharper rise in offtake, leading to an 8.6 percent market share in the anti-marks cream category (versus 7.6 percent last year). Strong hold was visible in its key market Uttar Pradesh, wherein its urban market share is about 12 percent.Source: CompanyThe management pointed out that raw material prices are seeing a softening trend and is expected to turn favourable from Q4 onwards. It keeps raw material inventory till February and hence gross margin improvement would be apparent thereafter.After witnessing weak offtake in wholesale channel towards the end of Q2, it has rebounded strongly in the quarter under review. This suggests that rural growth is still intact for the company. This is interesting because Bajaj Consumer Care was among the few in Q2 report to caution about a possible weakness in rural demand. Among others, launch of a smaller Rs 10 pet jar pack for ADHO has been instrumental in better penetration in the hinterland.NoneWhile international sales (three percent revenue share) growth revived, volume growth remains bleak (-2 percent YoY)NoneCanteen Stores Department (CSD) channel has been a key contributor of growth in Q3, with 4 percent revenue share and 35 percent sales growth. However, on account of uncertainties with respect to government policy on CSD little can be said about future prospects.NoneThe stock has corrected 27 percent from its 52-week high and is currently trading at 21 times FY20 estimated earnings. This makes it among the cheapest FMCG stocks available.Given the improved business context for its existing portfolio, participation in rural growth and prevailing stock price, we have turned constructive. But given the competitive intensity and limited diversification, we expect it to trade at discount to the median trading multiple of the FMCG sector."

title,IND vs AUS 1st ODI: Rohit Sharma's brilliant hundred goes in vain as India lose series-opener
datetime,2019-01-12 17:39:00+00:00
description,Sharma conjured up a magnificent 133 of 129 balls for his 22nd ODI hundred but eventually it only helped in reducing the defeat-margin as India ended up at 254 for nine while chasing a 289-run target.
content,"Rohit Sharma's individual brilliance was not enough to make up for a floundering top and middle order as India suffered a 34-run defeat at the hands of a resilient Australia in the first One-day International.Sharma conjured up a magnificent 133 of 129 balls for his 22nd ODI hundred but eventually it only helped in reducing the defeat-margin as India ended up at 254 for nine while chasing a 289-run target.Three of India's top four batsmen could not reach double-digit and lasted a mere 11 balls.With 10 fours and six sixes, Sharma reached his hundred off 110 balls, equalling Sourav Ganguly's record of 22 ODI centuries and is now behind only Sachin Tendulkar (49) and Virat Kohli (38).India were gasping after losing three batsmen at a single-digit score of four before Sharma and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (51) combined to stitch together a 137-run stand for the fourth wicket.Debutant Jason Behrendorff broke the partnership by sending back Dhoni, who became only the fifth Indian batsman to complete 10,000 runs in ODI cricket during the course of his knock that came off 96 balls.Tendulkar, Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Kohli are the other batsmen to achieve the feat. The hosts owe their 1-0 lead in the three-match series to a collective batting effort by their middle-order batsmen, specially Peter Handscomb, who switched gears in time to steer his side to 288 for five with his 73-run knock.Handscomb and Marcus Stoinis (47 not out) grabbed the momentum with their 68-run stand for the fifth wicket as Australia scored 93 runs in the last 10 overs.Usman Khawaja (59) and Shaun Marsh (54) also scored half-centuries for the hosts who lost skipper Aaron Finch (6) in a slow start after electing to bat.Young paceman Jhye Richardson (4/26) rocked the Indian middle order by dismissing India skipper Virat Kohli (3) and Ambati Rayudu (0) in space of three balls and later added wickets of Dinesh Karthik and Ravindra Jadeja in a career-best performance.First, Behrendorff (2-39) trapped Shikhar Dhawan lbw for a first-ball duck before Richardson swung into action. Kohli was caught at short square leg, and then two balls later Rayudu (0) was trapped plumb lbw, as the Indian top-order was destroyed.It put huge brakes on the scoring even as Sharma and Dhoni struggled to get going. So much so, India managed only a paltry 21-3 in the first ten overs.Their 50-stand came off 82 balls, while they took India past 100 in the 26th over even as Australia started to feel the pressure.Sharma reached his half-century off 62 balls, while Dhoni reached his 68th ODI half-century off 93 balls.Thanks to the initial caution, India were only placed at 141-4 in the 32nd over, when Dhoni was trapped lbw by Behrendorff.Sharma was starting to run out of partners thereafter as Richardson castled Dinesh Karthik in the 40th over.The run-chase came to an informal end by the 46th over as Ravindra Jadeja (8) and Sharma holed out in the space of ten balls.Marcus Stoinis (2-66) dismissed Sharma, and India's hopes perished with him for there was too much for the remaining tail-enders to do.Earlier, India spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2/54) and Jadeja (1/48) shared three wickets between them while pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/66) accounted for two batsmen.Kumar bowled Finch (6) in the third over, an inswinger slipping in through the gate.Alex Carey (24) made a good start and was looking set for a longer innings, when Yadav outfoxed him in his very first over, caught at slip off a quicker top-spinner. Australia only managed 41-2 in the first 10 overs.It brought Khawaja and Marsh together, and they put on 92 runs off 111 balls for the third wicket. In doing so, they pushed India to make changes in the middle overs.Khaleel Ahmed (0/55) had an off day as he struggled with this front-foot and control over line and length.Khawaja-Marsh pair added 50 in 61 balls as Australia crossed 100 in the 23rd over. Khawaja brought up his fifth ODI half-century off 70 balls, and opened up a bit more to play some attractive sweeps.But he perished in that manner as Jadeja trapped him lbw in the 29th over, providing a crucial breakthrough for India. Marsh carried on though, and reached his 13th ODI half-century off 65 balls. He put up 53 runs off 55 balls with Handscomb for the fourth wicket.Their 50-run stand came off only 49 balls as Australia started to show a little more urgency. Australia finally managed to cross 200 in the 42nd over, but had lost Marsh in the process as he holed out off Yadav in the 38th over.Stoinis' arrival at the crease had helped press matters as both he and Handscomb opened up with a couple sixes and upped the run-rate."

content,"The striking BEST workers' union and the Maharashtra government Monday failed to reach an agreement before the Bombay High Court to end the stir.The high court Monday said it would pass appropriate orders on Tuesday on the 7-day-old BEST bus strike if the union and state authorities failed to end the deadlock.A bench of Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice NM Jamdar also said ""things cannot continue as they are"". The high court bench Monday directed the high power committee, constituted by the Maharashtra government last week to negotiate with the striking union, to submit a report in a sealed cover clarifying its views on some of the urgent demands of the union.The bench has been urging the union, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the state government and BEST undertaking to resolve issues in a ""congenial environment"" and ensure minimum inconvenience to the public.Over 32,000 employees of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) are on strike since Tuesday last week and 3,700 buses in its fleet are off the roads.The high court has been hearing, since last week, a PIL filed by lawyer Datta Mane urging the court to pass interim orders directing BEST workers to call off the strike immediately.Following the high court's intervention, the state government constituted a committee headed by the chief secretary and held meetings with the union and all other stakeholders.On Monday, the state and the BMC told the bench that while they had proposed several solutions to resolve the issues being faced by the BEST workers, the union was still adamant on not withdrawing the strike.Appearing for the state, Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni reiterated before the bench that the strike was ""illegal"" in view of the state's laws on essential services and a previous order of the Industrial Court in the city.""The strike has no legal sanction. The union has made its point by calling the strike and all concerned authorities, including this court, have taken a serious note of their demands. Therefore, the strike must now be called off and the union must enter into negotiations with the committee with an open mind,"" Kumbhakoni said.The union's counsel Neeta Karnik, however, told the bench that the workers were most concerned about the pay grade of around 15,000 junior-level employees who earn less than Rs 15,000 per month.And they would think about going back to work only if they were convinced that the authorities were going to address the above issue on a priority basis, Karnik told court."

title,'Damaging mistake': Porinju’s bet on LEEL goes awry as stock tanks 80%

description,EQ India Fund & PMS clients of Equity Intelligence India Pvt Ltd hold 8.38 percent stake. The firm held 7.9 percent stake in the quarter ended June
content,"NoneThe stock lost more than 80 percent of value since 2018 till date. The stock fell from Rs 287.60 recorded on December 29, 2017 to Rs 47.65 on 11 January 2019.According to September shareholding data, EQ India Fund & PMS clients of Equity Intelligence India Pvt Ltd held 8.38 percent stake. The firm held 7.9 percent stake in the quarter ended June.Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the letter.In a rare admission, the Kochi-based investor, in a letter to investors said: ""Our investment in LEEL has witnessed a significant capital erosion and I admit that in hindsight it looks a mistake. My assumption that siphoning off in a changing regulatory environment would be difficult appears faulty.""""LEEL share price is nearly 80 percent low from the cost in most of the accounts. While we cannot rule out a possibility of eventual recovery in the share price, the damage has already been done. Rare but costly misjudgments like LEEL resulting in permanent loss of capital are humbling and thought-provoking for us in our pursuit to create wealth for our investors through long term value investing,"" he said.However, he further added that ""such flawed investments though big enough to be a drag on our investment journey, I am confident, would not deter us from creating wealth going forward.None5 reasons for investing in LEEL as highlighted in the letter:• The company had received Rs 1,550 crore cash from the sale of Consumer Durable (CD) division to Havells and was trading at Rs 1,000 crore market cap (Now Rs 200 crore).• The company had a good long-term operating track record in air conditioning and white goods space, having successfully created and divested the ""Lloyd"" brand of appliances.• The company had just sold the brand ""Lloyd"" along with associated intangible assets and had retained the operating assets including 8 manufacturing facilities in India and abroad and was set to continue its business of being an OEM supplier to other major manufacturers.• Post demonetisation and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), corporate governance standards, law enforcement and business culture in India was improving and it was getting tougher to siphon off from public listed companies. Also subsequent to the Companies Act 2013, and various SEBI initiatives, the minority shareholder rights were getting stronger. Under these circumstances, the likelihood of LEEL promoters siphoning off the cash received from the sale of CD division was low.• Given the opportunities that the space in which LEEL operates and being cash rich, the most logical path for the promoters who have been in the business for around three decades, would have been to take the company to higher orbits and thereby creating wealth for all the stakeholders involved.What really happened?Porinju in the letter said that his firm had accumulated nearly 5.4 percent of the company by October 2017. The company reported Rs 946.43 crore profit from the sale of CD division in Q218 results in November 2017, in line with the investment thesis.Strong Quarterly Results:Q318 results published in February 2018 also confirmed the same Rs 946.43 crore profit figure and we continued to buy LEEL. By end of February 2018, we held nearly 8 percent of the company’s equity.Management change with the demise of promoter:Meanwhile, in December 2017, the promoter of the company Brij Raj Punj passed away and his son, Bharat Punj took over the reins of the company.Throughout our interactions with Bharat Punj and other senior management in various occasions, they sounded optimistic about the business and future of the company, in line with our investment rationale.Company wrote back the profit from the sale of CD division:On May 30, 2018, to the shock of minority shareholders, the company arbitrarily wrote back the profit from the sale of CD division in FY18 annual results to Rs 663 crore, triggering a selloff in the stock.Diversion of funds to promoters:The company also diverted nearly Rs 340 crore to promoter entities including the listed debt-laden entity Fedders Electric Ltd. as capex and loans for buying land and factories of their own plants. The stock fell from Rs 215 to Rs 127 in five days and the liquidity in the counter dried up.Exploring legal remedies:A complaint was filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), seeking a forensic audit of books of accounts of LEEL Electricals, without which the suspected fraudulent actions of the promoters and senior management to siphon off company’s wealth for personal enrichment cannot be proven legally.Management exits -- a cause of concern:In the two months after a complaint was filed with SEBI, there has been several high levels exits from the company including many from senior management like the group CFO, Company Secretary, and VP Finance, Operations Director etc.Fall in value:"

We cater to the patients surrounding 5-7 kilometres, people these days don’t like travelling,” said Dr Vikram Shah, CMD of Shalby.He declined to name the hospitals, as the talks are still on.These two hospitals are in addition to the Rs 160-crore capital expansion undertaken by the Ahmedabad-headquartered hospital chain to add 538 beds.Part of this expansion plan includes setting up multi-speciality hospitals in Nashik and Vadodara with a total capacity of 263 beds.Rest of the additional beds will come from two hospitals in Mumbai that the company plans to take over.In the first one, the healthcare provider has taken over operations and management (O&M) of 50-bedded Zynova Hospital in Ghatkopar, Mumbai, and is adding another 100 beds to make it a 150-bed hospital.Shalby also entered into an agreement to takeover O&M of 110-bedded Asha Parekh Hospital in Santacruz, Mumbai which was shut down in February last year due to losses. Shalby is further expanding Asha Parekh Hospital by adding 65 beds.Present networkShalby started by Shah, an orthopaedic surgeon in 1994, has emerged as a market leader in joint replacement surgeries in India, with around 15 percent share among private hospitals, according to Frost & Sullivan.Around three-fourths of its Rs 3,923 revenue in FY18, came from joint replacement surgeries. The rest from other specialities such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, bariatrics, liver and renal transplant.Shalby mainly operates in western and central India. The company operates dozens of outpatient clinics in India, Africa and UAE to feed its hospitals.At present, Shalby has a network of 11 hospitals with 2012 bed capacity, of which around 50 percent are operational.Eighty percent of its overall revenue and close to 100 percent of EBITDA came from four mature hospitals Vijay Shalby, SG Shalby and Krishna Shalby in Ahmedabad and Shalby Vapi.Shah said the hospital chain will be going for one more round of fundraising this year. The promoters will be diluting 10 percent stake through a qualified institutional placement (QIP)“We have to do another dilution in a year’s time because we have not done 25 percent dilution as planned. We have done only 17-18 percent,” Shah said.The promoters of Shalby led by Shah, his family members and associates hold around 79.41 percent stake. The company has a market capitalisation of Rs 1,570 crore as on January 14.Shah said the government decision to cap the prices of knee implants actually helped them, as more people were able to get knee replacement surgeries with prices coming down."

title,Look before you leap: Pure term insurance versus return of premium plan
datetime,2019-01-16 09:32:00+00:00
description,"Though term plan with return of premium policies promise to give you back premiums at the end of the policy tenure, there’s a cost: high premiums when compared to term plans."
content,"It’s natural for investors to ask ‘how much will I get in return?’ Many of us tend to do this on our insurance products as well. The general tendency of the common man is that any financial product one purchases, they want return from it. But how do you contemplate earning from an insurance policy that is, well, meant to insure you?In April 2018, Delhi-based Sridhar K Maji, 30, took advice from his friend and bought a life insurance policy. But he didn’t buy a pure term life insurance policy. He bought a return of premium (TROP) policy with sum assured of Rs 1 crore for a term of 30 years. The policy requires him to pay Rs 21,000 a year for the next 3 years.“The insurance agent who sold me this policy told me that my family ‘will get protected right from day#1’. So, if I die before I reach the age of 60, my nominee will get a lump sum amount,” says Sridhar.Unknown to him though, Sridhar walked into a trap. The agent elaborated that not only will his nominee get a lump sum in case Sridhar dies, but Sridhar “would not be making a loss.” Here’s how. A pure term plan pays the nominee an amount, only if the policyholder dies during the policy’s tenure. But an ordinary term plan policy doesn’t pay anything to the nominee if the policy holder - Sridhar in this case - doesn’t die. The policy that Sridhar bought was a Term Insurance Return of Premium plan (TROP). This plan pays back all the premiums that the policyholder would pay throughout the policy’s tenure.He knew that the TROP wouldn’t pay any interest. In simple words, his agent explained to him, it would mean that Sridhar would make “no losses”.Sridhar TROP policy entailed him to pay a premium of Rs 21,000 per annum. The policy term was of 30 years. As per the policy conditions, if nothing happened to him, he would get Rs 6.3 lakh (excluding taxes and other charges) back in the year of 2048; the sum total of all the premiums he would pay till the time the policy matures. That looks like a big amount. But did he miss the woods for the trees?Return of premium is zero percent returnIf a financial instrument returns the exact same amount that you invest in it, then your financial product has given you zero percent returns. Still, you might think its okay because you haven’t made a loss. Think again.If he would have purchased a pure term plan instead of a TROP policy, the pure term policy would have cost him the premium of approximately Rs 9,000 for a cover of Rs 1 Crore for 30 years. Instead, Sridhar has paid Rs 21,000 on his TROP. Hence, he paid extra Rs 12,000, per annum, for the same cover while buying TROP policy. Over 30 years, Sridhar will end up paying a total of Rs 3.6 lakh.Moneycontrol ran some numbers to see if you really didn’t make a loss. Not only he paid an extra premium but he also missed out on the opportunity cost. The extra premium of Rs 12,000 could have been invested towards retirement planning product like Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Pension Scheme (NPS) or any G-sec funds.If he would have invested Rs 12,000 every year in an equity mutual fund scheme, he would have got back around Rs 32 lakh at the end of 30 year, assuming an equity fund grows at a compounded rate of 12%. That is Sridhar’s real loss.Amol Joshi, Founder, Plan Rupee told Moneycontrol that company charges a higher premium as they segregate the amount between the basic premiums and remaining, they invest basically in G-sec to earn higher interest. However, people should ideally create their own insurance and investment plan. They should buy pure term insurance instead of buying TROP policy and they should invest the remaining amount in various investment avenues like Public Provident Fund (PPF), Fixed Deposits (FD), National Pension Scheme (NPS), G-Sec and mutual funds and try to manage their investment amount by themselves. Thus, this way one can make more money at the end. “Moreover unlike in TROP policy, people are not bound to make huge payments till the policy term. They can invest this extra amount as per their financial goals,"" he said.Why TROP policy comes with a higher rate of premium?As we know that the sole purpose of a term insurance plan is to get financial cover in the event of the death of the insured. As there is no investment component and only the death benefit is paid on the death of the life insured, a pure term plan has very low premiums. However, under a TROP Plan, if the insured survives the policy term, a sum of all premiums paid (less applicable taxes, rider premiums, underwriting extra, if any) or a higher amount depending upon the plan and insurer is paid.Mahavir Chopra, Director - Health, Life & Strategic Initiatives, Coverfox.com says that as the insurer is accumulating the premiums received on behalf of the insured person and is going to pay the same amount back at the end of the policy term, a higher premium is charged to meet the administrative charges, TROP premium management expenses. “These additional expenses and the promise of returns make TROP demand a higher premium making it roughly 2 to 3 times costlier than a pure term plan,” said Chopra.Joshi says that TROP policy superficially gives you an idea of getting your premiums back. In reality, it is not the way you think of it. Every product comes with a cost, and let say, if a company will return you the same premium as charged against pure term plan then what will they earn at the end. “Hence, to manage the base premium expenses of the policy (which is the premium amount of a pure term plan) and recovering that amount throughout the policy term, insurance companies charge a higher premium in case of TROP policy,” he said.What should you do?Instead of opting TROP, you should always go for a pure term insurance plan. However, while planning to purchase this pure protection product you need to keep few things in mind.When you decide the cover amount think about your life stage and the number of family members who need to get protection. Understand their lifestyle and accordingly, decide the policy cover. Thus, this cover amount should determine your family needs. Also, if you have any liabilities like short term loans, personal loans, car loan, or home loan add that amount with overall life cover. This will prevent the burden of EMI repayment from falling on your family against the uncertainty.So when it comes to finally decide on what plan you need to purchase, irrespective of the type of insurance company you select to take pure term insurance cover, go with an insurer having higher claim settlement ratio. Higher the claim settlement ratio, better are the chances of availing the sum assured.NoneAlso, keep in mind that you should plan your after retirement days too. As we have seen Sridhar was only bothered about protecting his family till retirement. But, what about after retirement when you won’t get regular income and your household expenses will remain the same? Hence, it makes sense to choose your term plan wisely and plan it in such a way that your family get well protected even after retirement.Priyesh Shah, Certified Financial Planner, CoinBazaar.in told Moneycontrol that one should smartly select the plans when it comes to term insurance. “If you follow wrong advice, your family might have to pay the price if the policy had some terms which would affect the claim & if you follow professional advice you get the appropriate insurance for you which will certainly secure your family,” he said."

content,"When Indian films started embracing technology in the last few years, it gave rise to high concept films.NoneNoneNoneWhile 2018 was a year of small films, industry insiders believe that big screen spectacles are huge contributors in increasing admissions to theatres. They also regard such projects as event films due to their high production value and eye-catching visuals. They are also of the opinion that these films are the way ahead for the Indian film industry.But the question remains whether such large budgets can be justified especially when these films tank at the box office.NoneNoneWhile Hollywood offers many big budget spectacles in a year, Bollywood restricts itself to seven to eight such offerings. They are mostly produced by big banners that ensure a balanced mix of small medium and big-size films. This means that it is a mixed bag for them at the end of the year in terms of profits and losses.“In 2019, most of the big budget films are being made by Karan Johar, Yash Raj Films or Sajid Nadiadwala. These are the three filmmakers that are traditionally known to make big budget films. Except of 1-2 failures they have done so well all this while,” Tuteja said.On whether the industry learnt its lesson after the lacklustre performance of two major films, Tuteja said that “the industry learnt its lesson in 2016-2017 and that is why there were so many good films that came in 2018.”However, there still remains certain aspects that the industry needs to work on. First is high star remuneration that eats up a big portion of the budget which is not the case in Hollywood. Modest salaries give better opportunities to work on important factors like visual effects, sets and an experience that cannot be viewed at home.No matter what the size of the budget is, film experts opine that for every film, a strong storyline is a must.In addition, experts say that there is no denying that with bigger budgets come bigger risks but when the risks are calculated it will guarantee success.Shortcomings in the exhibition space is a huge hurdle for big screen spectacles. India works with 8,000 odd theatres divided between single screens and multiplexes. This poses a big a problem as there are not enough screens to draw maximum profits especially for big-budget films."

title,How to use home loan and rental outgo to save income tax
datetime,2019-04-18 07:07:00+00:00
description,"A taxpayer can claim deduction of the amount paid towards repayment of the home loan from his income. Such loan must have been borrowed from specified entities like the government, bank, LIC, entities engaged in housing finance or specified employers. "
content,"Sanjeev PanditHome sweet home, we all say that. All of us wish to own the house we live in. With escalating prices of the real estate, it makes sense to borrow money to acquire the house and pay interest instead of rent.This is particularly true when one is comparatively young. While the value of the house goes up over the years, the loan liability goes on decreasing with repayment of the loan. With the increased income, the burden of interest and repayment of loan seems lighter.However, when rentals and real estate prices are stagnant, one should consider if renting a house is a better option. Nonetheless, in the initial years, the burden is heavy and a homeowner wants to lighten it in every possible way. Let us look at ways to do that.NoneOnce the house is complete and is occupied or rented out, the taxpayer can claim deduction of interest paid on the home loan. Interest paid during the years when the house was under construction, is allowed equally over five years from the year in which house is completed. If the house is self-occupied, the deduction is limited to Rs 2 lakh per year. If the house is given on rent, deduction of the whole of interest is permissible.In the initial years, often the interest outgo is far higher than the rent received. Till recently, the resultant loss could be adjusted against other income. The law has been changed and now in a year the set-off loss for the year is limited to Rs. 2 lakh and the loss in excess of that is carried forward to be set off in the subsequent 8 years only against income from house property.It is interesting to note that in the subsequent years if there is sufficient income from house property, there is no restriction on set-off of the quantum of loss that has been brought forward. Once the loan is repaid, the taxpayer may have sufficient property income for setting off the loss.In order to mitigate the hardship caused by limitation of deduction of the interest or restriction on set off of loss, the taxpayer may consider acquiring the house along with the spouse. In such a case, if both the partners contribute, borrow and make repayment of loan and payment of interest jointly, then each owner will be entitled to claim the deduction towards repayment of loan, payment of interest up to Rs 2 lakh in case of a self-occupied house and set-off loss of Rs 2 lakhs against other income. This is possible where both, husband and wife, have sufficient income.NoneA taxpayer not receiving HRA or who is not a salaried employee can claim deduction for the rent paid for his house. For claiming this, the rent paid should exceed 10% of the total income. The deduction is limited to lower of Rs 5,000 per month and 25% of the total income for the year.If the employer follows ‘cafeteria approach’ where the employee is given freedom to structure his compensation within certain limits, the employee can choose to bifurcate the remuneration appropriately between basic salary, HRA and other allowances to maximise the deduction/exemption available. Sometimes, if the employer takes the house on rent and allots it to the employee as a perquisite, the value of perquisite may work out to be substantially lower.One must take care to have proper documentation for claiming the deduction/exemption. In some of the states, rental agreements, lease agreements or leave and licence agreements need to be stamped and duly registered. It is advisable to comply with these provisions. While there is no restriction for renting a house from a relative, it is necessary that the arrangement is bonafide. It may be difficult to claim the deduction if you are paying rent to your wife or parents and they are staying with you in the same house."

description,The Master Blaster in an interview on his official app 100MB also spoke about how other team members are performing well and urged fans to support newcomers
content,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni's vintage theatrics in the second ODI against Australia at Adelaide brought him many a laurel but one of the best ones has come from batting Sachin Tendulkar. The middle-order batsman won India the match with a six in the last over.Perhaps going through his worst patch of form, Dhoni still has a commanding strike rate of 68. 10 and Tendulkar feels the the batsman can play an anchor-like role in batting.The Master Blaster on 100 MB app, said that “Dhoni from now, will be more like an anchor who will control the game till the end”. Tendulkar mentioned that he noticed the change in Dhoni’s thought process. Sachin said, “In the first match, MS was a bit rusty and was not able to hit the ball where he wanted to, and that can happen to anyone.”Tendulkar further said that MSD was taking his time in the second ODI by playing dot balls and analysing the bowling and play shots accordingly. Sachin also praised Karthik’s performance and called him a great finisher for complementing Dhoni during the final overs of the match. He cited that it would be difficult for the team management to include Rishabh Pant into the playing 11, especially when Dhoni and Karthik are playing so well.Dhoni has drawn flak for his poor performance as a batsman. Dhoni scored 252 runs in ODIs during 2018, averaging only 25.20. It is the second time that the former captain scored below 40.00 in ODIs, his worst after averaging 27.80 in 2016. However, fans of MSD came forward to shut critics after his performance against Australia during the second ODI in Adelaide. Dhoni scored 55 off 54 balls while chasing a target of 299 and had a crucial role in India’s win against the Aussies. He had critical partnerships with Virat Kohli and Dinesh Karthik that led India to a last over victory against the host by six wickets. Many cricketers came forward and tweeted praises for MSD’s calm composure and shot selection. Sachin Tendulkar too was one of the many cricketers who applauded Dhoni for his performance.“It is good to have Pant in the side, but we already have two wicket-keeper batsmen who are performing very well. Including Pant into the squad will mean the team will have to exclude one batsman at the lower middle order or a bowler and I don’t think we can remove a bowler. If he replaces an all-rounder, then it will cost us a lot”, he said."

title,What else can you get instead of the Honda CB300R?

description,The Honda CB300R is expected to be priced at a sub-3 lakh mark but it will be considered a rival for most sub-400cc motorcycles.
content,"Honda revealed its plans to launch the CB300R, a naked retro-modern sports bike, essentially a smaller CB1000R. It is expected to be priced at a sub-3 lakh mark but it will be considered a rival for most sub-400cc motorcycles. Keeping that in mind, here is a list of competitors for the Honda CB300R.KTM 390 Duke One of the obvious choices, the 390 Duke has set a benchmark in the Indian market as a low-cost, high power alternative to the otherwise seemingly rich culture of motorcycling. After three generations, the 2018 390 Duke has become the pinnacle of technology for sub-400cc naked bikes, what with the inclusion of slipper clutch, switchable ABS and Bluetooth connectivity.Kawasaki Z250Seemingly an underdog, the Z250 might have a smaller engine than the rest, but it is in no way a bike which will stay behind. Carrying the title of ‘World’s First 250cc street-fighter’, the Z250 is a potent, twin-cylinder powered machine, which makes almost the same power figures as the Honda CB300R. Naturally, this bike is not giving up without a fight.Benelli TNT 300While not being the most agile horse in the stable, the Benelli TNT 300 packs a solid punch, being the only other twin cylinder in this segment. Weighing in at a whopping 196 kg (Wet weight), this bike is not easy to handle. But once accustomed to, the low centre of gravity and the sticky Pirellis which come as standard make sure that the bike follows the desired path.Husqvarna SvartpilenThe Svartpilen comes bearing the 390 Duke's engine and that puts it in the same league. The Husky is set to hit the road soon, almost at the same time period as the Honda. Though, it is expected to be priced significantly higher, and that could be one of the prime deciding factors for this motorcycle.Bajaj Dominar 400"

title,Here’s how India is benefiting from the AI revolution
datetime,2019-01-17 10:23:00+00:00
description,"Apart from engaging with customers and optimizing operations, AI is also making healthcare more accessible and affordable. "
content,"India has the highest penetration of artificial intelligence skills among the workforce. AI is the fastest growing skills set and increasing exponentially, said Anant Maheshwari, President, Microsoft India, while addressing an event at the company’s R&D centre in Bengaluru.He also said that today the GDP component impacted by digital technologies in India is 8 percent which will increase to 60 percent by 2021. This confidence is powered by India’s adoption of AI solutions to create breakthrough innovations and accelerate the digital transformation of the country. According to Microsoft, over 700 business and government organizations have adopted its Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. Over 60 percent of these AI customers come from large businesses in manufacturing, financial services. There is no denying that the Indian consumer is one the biggest beneficiaries of recent advances in AI. When a customer at Future Generali uses the AI chatbot REVA to either get policy status, or premium due date, or make renewal payments, it signals that Indian consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI. According to Gartner, 25 percent of all customer service and support operations will integrate virtual customer assistant or chatbot technology across engagement channels by 2020, up from less than 2 percent in 2017.Maheshwari in his address also said that the use cases of AI is growing in India and that will be a game changer for the country. Talview, an AI enabled talent assessment technology provider, saved an upward of 9,000 hours of time of a customer in identifying, sourcing and screening talent. And it does this by using its automated video interviewing solution which helps customers hire from the untapped talent pool from multiple cities across the country. Apart from engaging with customers and optimizing operations, AI is also making healthcare more accessible and affordable. But how? One example of this is Narayana Health which has implemented real-time data analytics and predictive insights across their operations running on Microsoft Azure, SQL Server and Power BI.With the help of AI solutions, the hospital chain can predict better cost of surgeries, reduce the time spent by patients in the ICU or monitor consumables and antibiotic use. In 2018, Microsoft partnered with Apollo Hospitals to use AI for early detection of cardiac diseases. SRL Diagnostics is applying Ai for more accurate diagnosis in digital pathology and early detection of diseases such as cancer. NITI Aayog is working with Microsoft and Forus Health to roll out a technology for early detection of diabetic retinopathy as a pilot project. In the report National strategy for artificial intelligence, Niti Aayog said that 3Nethra, developed by Forus Health, can screen for common eye problem. It is a is a portable device.Integrating AI capabilities to this device using Microsoft’s retinal imaging APIs enables operators of 3Nethra device to get AI-powered insights even when they are working at eye checkup camps in remote areas with nil or intermittent connectivity to the cloud, the report further said. The resultant technology solution also solves for quality issues with image capture and systems checks in place to evaluate the usability of the image captured. Microsoft will also provide farm advisory services to Niti Aayog which will help increase crop yield, pest detection and pest incident predictions as part of projects across locations identified by NITI Aayog. Adoption of AI for healthcare applications is expected to see an exponential increase in next few years, said Niti Aayog in its discussion paper on National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. "

Whether Aprilia uses the same engine or bumps it up to stiffen the competition against the Yamaha R15 V3 is anybody’s guess at this point.The sturdy perimeter frame, USD forks and ABS is expected to be carried over and that will considerably increase the stability and comfort for the rider. However, whether ABS will be single or dual-channel is yet to be seen and considering the bike to be a premium offering, we are banking on the dual-channel."

With its sleek, design, and a roomier cabin, the Elite i20 is a viable option to the Wagon R.Renault KwidThough the French car maker has had a rough patch for a while, its budget hatchback, the Kwid fared fairly well in the Indian markets. Becoming one of the highest selling hatches, the Kwid will surely make its presence felt.Volkswagen PoloThe German giant Volkswagen does not seem to believe in less power. So the entire lineup of the Polo, including the GT and the Golf, has a lot of hatchbacks with serious power figures. That, combined with a rugged body, could pose as a threat.Tata Tiago"

The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2018, aims to give employees the right to refuse work-related calls and emails beyond work hours.It is aimed at reducing work-related stress among employees and improve work-life balance. The bill also proposes to set-up an Employees’ Welfare Authority that will provide counselling and access to digital detox centres.With a dismal track record of PMBs, it remains unclear as to when these bills will be taken up for discussion.NoneWhat is a Private Member’s Bill?A Member of Parliament (MP) who is not a Minister in the Union Cabinet is called a Private Member. Bills introduced by such members are called Private Member's Bills. A PMB can be introduced in either the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Bills introduced by ministers are called Government Bills.Generally, the 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm slot on alternate Fridays during sessions are reserved for discussion on PMBs.There are no restrictions as to what a PMB should be about. The scope of a PMB is same as that of a Government Bill. These bills can deal with any issue and can also be a Constitutional Amendment Bill.Unlike a Government Bill, a PMB is not discussed by the Council of Ministers internally.NoneThe procedurePMBs are drafted by MPs themselves or by their staff. These bills are, however, scrutinised and checked by the Parliament Secretariat for technicalities and legal consistency.The member has to provide a one-month notice along with a copy of the ‘Statement of Object and Reasons’. Through the statement, the member is required to elaborate on the bill.In case there are multiple PMBs being proposed at the same time, a ballot system is used to determine the sequence of bills for introduction.There is also a Parliamentary Committee on Private Member's Bills and Resolutions that goes through all PMBs. The committee classifies these Bills based on their urgency and importance, which in turn, determines which would be discussed first.Track recordNoneNoneIn fact, only 14 PMBs have become laws in India since independence. No PMB has become law since 1970.The Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 was passed by the Rajya Sabha after a gap of 45 years.NoneWhy do they fail?Over a period of time, governments have been averse to lending support to a PMB.A successful passing of PMB is perceived by many as incompetence on part of the government and intrusion into the respective ministry’s domain.Governments in the past have also at times cut short the path of PMBs. If such a bill is seen getting support in Parliament, the government requests the MP to withdraw it and promises to introduce it as a Government Bill instead. The member who had tabled The Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 was requested by the government to withdraw it."

content,"None --------------------------------------------------NoneNoneNoneKey Positives-Petrochemical segment's topline grew 37 percent YoY, with higher realisation and improved volumes in fibre intermediates and polymer products.-Weakness in the polymer margins was offset by strong polyester margins during the quarter.-Gross refining margins at $8.8/bbl were $0.7/bbl lower compared to the preceding quarter due to weak crude oil prices, in line with the global weakness in GRMs. Still, GRMs were substantially above the global Singapore benchmark, indicating a healthy inventory management during the quarter.None-Refining business saw a healthy volume growth.-Jio revenues topped Rs 10,000 crore, up 12 percent QoQ. Operating profits improved on higher margins with expanding customer base (280 million).-Despite strong competition, Jio posted a solid growth in subscriber base (up 11 percent QoQ) though there was a slight reduction in churn rate.-Retail segment revenues nearly doubled YoY, driven by healthy festive season sales and rapid store additions. Higher operating leverage lifted margins by 160 basis points YoY.-Media business saw a healthy 23 percent YoY growth on improved advertising revenue, profits in movie production and healthy growth in subscription income. Strong performance in regional channels and operating leverage drove the segment’s profitability.Key Negatives -Interest cost nearly doubled YoY primarily due to higher borrowings for petchem projects and digital services. Jio’s interest costs spiked nearly 9 percent QoQ. However, the increase in finance costs was lower compared to growth in revenue and operating profits.-High fuel prices, higher production, and expanding network expenses led to a noticeable expansion in other expenses.-Upstream oil and gas business continued to be an overhang on profits.-While Jio’s subscriber base continued to expand, the pace of the growth moderated primarily due to base effect and increased competition.None-Discounts and offers (to protect as well as gain market share) kept the ARPU of all industry players under pressure and Jio’s ARPU witnessed a marginal decline.OutlookRIL is steadily moving from a commodity driven business to a more consumer oriented business which we believe would aid a rerating for the stock. With the full commissioning of the petchem units, we expect great vertical integration and higher margins for the petrochemical business which is already witnessing increasing demand and posting aggressive growth.Reliance retail and Jio are now at the core focus for expansion and are expected to drive the revenue growth in the coming quarters.Jio’s strategy of deeper and wider market penetration would continue to disrupt the entire value chain. The company is planning to make further inroads through various strategic tie-ups and partnerships (Disney, DEN, Hathaway) and roll-out of new services (JioGigaFiber).Aggressive store additions, improved customer engagement and strong distribution network will drive rapid expansion in the retail segment. Impetus towards operational efficiencies, expansion of margin-accretive private label brands and economies of scale should help improve profitability of the segment in the coming quarters.The company has key ingredients to emerge an integrated telecom, retail and energy giant on the back of its strong financials, execution capabilities, spare capacity and the huge unmet potential available in India."

The study attributes the reflection to a methane rainfall event, followed by a probable period of evaporation.""It's like looking at a sunlit wet sidewalk,"" Dhingra said.This reflective surface represents the first observations of summer rainfall on the moon's northern hemisphere.If compared to Earth's yearly cycle of four seasons, a season on Titan lasts seven Earth years.Cassini arrived at Titan during the southern summer and observed clouds and rainfall in the southern hemisphere, researchers said.Climate models of Titan predicted similar weather would occur in the northern hemisphere in the years leading up to the northern summer solstice in 2017, they said.However, by 2016, the expected cloud cover in the northern hemisphere had not appeared. This observation may help scientists gain a more complete understanding of Titan's seasons.""We want our model predictions to match our observations. This rainfall detection proves Cassini's climate follows the theoretical climate models we know of,"" Dhingra said.Additional analyses suggest the methane rain fell across a relatively pebble-like surface, she said.A rougher surface generates an amorphous pattern as the liquid settles in crevasses and gullies, while liquid falling on a smooth surface would puddle in a relatively circular pattern."

description,An overview of the reports and rumours of a ban on two-stroke motorcycles.
content,"Two-stroke engines can be considered the pioneers of modern-day motorcycling technology. The smoke-spewing, road ripping engines were small, compact and yet packed a powerful punch. Unlike the electronically aided setups of today, two-stroke engines were complete mechanical marvels. So not only was it relatively easy to maintain them, the adaptability of the engine lured many into tuning them into potent race machines. Right from the ""well of death"" in circuses to quarter-mile drag strips on the highway, two-stroke motorcycles have always made their presence felt.NoneHowever, the existence of these motorcycles could be in peril, if the Karnataka government has its way. It had proposed a ban on two-stroke three-wheelers from April 1, 2019. However, considering the sheer amount of auto rickshaws on the road, the deadline was extended to April 31, 2020. This was done to allow RTO officials to renew fitness certificates issued to these rickshaws. (Image: Wikimedia Commons)"

Additional lever which has helped the company is its investment behind brands and visibility (Advertising cost at 12.4 percent of sales). We are also encouraged by company's recent M&A deals and expect that company’s emphasis on food and refreshments business could be next strategic growth lever.

It provides same-day courier delivery in the city, live tracking of orders and door-to-door service. The app is listed on the Google App Store and has over 10,000 downloads.Mehta got inspired to set up the courier service after he forgot some of his books at his uncle's place, which is far away from his residence. Tilak realised there aren't many apps or startups that offer delivery of goods on the same day, which is when the idea struck him. But, implementing such an idea in a big city like Mumbai was a challenge.This is where the Mumbai Dabbawala Association came in. Tilak approached these dabbawalas, who deliver food to over 2 lakh people in the city everyday for decades, and asked them their service range and fees per delivery. The dabbawalas came on board with Tilak’s company as their work could be done simultaneously and it would increase their income.To develop the logistics and technology to back Paper N Parcels, Tilak worked with his relatives to grow his business. The company now works with known pathology labs, known shipping agencies and their associates. The teenager's startup now employs 300 dabbawalas, who deliver 1,200 packages every day.

In the remaining 50 acres, it shall invite major national and international manufacturers as ancillary units, she said.Chairman Hero Cycles Pankaj Munjal said he hoped that the hi-tech cycle valley at Ludhiana would act as a catalyst for the overall development of the area, giving further impetus to the industrial development of Punjab.Hero Group was alone producing ten million cycles annually, which accounts for 7.5 per cent of the world production, he added.The upcoming cycle valley project would cater to 50 per cent demand of cycle production in India and Europe, said Munjal.Hero Cycles has invited globally reputed manufacturers with high end technology to set up ancillary vendor units in the industrial park, said Munjal.The company has been allowed to utilise land not only for industrial purpose but also for other allied operations covering warehousing, logistics, research and development centres and skill development centres.The Hi-tech cycle valley being set up by PSIEC would help in decongestion and relocating industry from Ludhiana, and encourage setting up of an anchor unit in the sector specific fields of cycle industry.Apart from investment of Rs 300 crore on infrastructure, the project would attract an estimated additional investment of Rs 1,000-1,500 crore."

This will add a third engine option for the Ciaz, apart from the Fiat-sourced 1.3-litre DDiS (Diesel Direct Injection System).As this engine is an addition to the line-up, Maruti Suzuki will not be discontinuing its current diesel engine. However, it can be safely assumed that the 1.5-litre variant could act as a replacement for the existing diesel engine in the future.Apart from a turbocharger, the new engine does not have any other supplements, like the SHVS (Smart Hybrid Vehicles by Suzuki) technology. It will, however, get a new six-speed manual transmission.The 1.5-litre inline-four engine delivers 95.1 PS of power, and 225 Nm of peak torque. It will reportedly be called DDiS225 and is claimed to return efficiency of 26.82 kmpl.

content,"On September 7, the Reserve Bank of India extended the tokenisation guidelines to card-on-file tokenisation (CoFT) services and said tokenisation of data should be done with explicit customer consent. This is being done to allow seamless recurring payments through tokenisation framework.What is card-on-file tokenisation?Card-on-file tokenisation is helpful for recurring payments as it can store payment information. In this scheme, multiple entities does the tokenisation. This includes payment gateway providers such as VISA, Mastercard, etc., payment aggregators and merchant outlets.What are the benefits of card-on-file tokenisation?It enables consumer payment details to be refreshed instantly when a card is lost, stolen or expires. The consumer does not have to login to online shopping account, over-the-top (OTT) platforms, etc. for updating the card details.What is tokenisation?Tokenisation of cards is a process by which your card details remain secure and do not get stored or revealed to the merchant. Only your card network and your card issuing bank knows them. The 16-digit number on the card gets replaced with a unique alternate code, also known as ‘token.’""Currently, card details shared by a customer while making card transactions are stored at the merchant’s end, which makes them susceptible to hacking or data theft,"" said Naveen Kukreja, CEO and CO-founder of Paisabazaar.com.NoneThe RBI has now made this feature formally available to all card networks. This feature is only available for purchases if you buy through your mobile phone or tablet. Tokenisation needs three elements to be present; your device, a token requester (TR) and a credit card. But how tokenisation help and what exactly do you have to do to be able to do shopping using this secure feature?How tokenisation works and customers could initiate it?To appreciate how tokenisation secures your vital information, let’s visualise how a normal credit card transaction.NoneEnter tokenisation. The firm that enables you to make a card (credit or debit) payment- in this case, Samsung, has to become the token requester (TR). Once you key in your card details on your Samsung phone, it generates a token from the card network whose card you use. For instance, if you register a VISA card (it doesn’t matter which bank’s credit card you use), then Samsung Pay will request for a token from VISA on your card. VISA will, in turn, issue a token that acts as a proxy to your card number. Now, whenever you use your card to buy a product, your card number will not travel through the payments system. Just select the card image that is stored and the TR will generate a token and complete the transaction.Let's go back to the shop from where you originally bought some goodies using your credit card. Once you swipe your Samsung phone (that has Samsung Pay on it and your credit card image stored on it), the acquirer sends your token to the card network. The card network has your original card number as well as your token. But your issuer bank only has your card number. Hence, it sends the card number to the issuer bank for payment authorization. Your bank authorizes it and sends the details back to the card network, which in-turn sends the acceptance to the acquirer. In all this, the only entity that knows your card details is the card network (VISA) and your own bank (card issuer; HDFC Bank).Tokenisation will be particularly useful when you buy something on an e-commerce website like Amazon or Flipkart. At present, many of us opt to store our card number and details on these websites. This speeds up our shopping as we merely have to select our chosen card at the time of check-out. But what if the e-commerce website is hacked into and our card details are lost?Tokenisation ensures that just our card image is stored. If the e-commerce website chooses to become a TR, every time we buy a product on an e-commerce website, we have to just select our card (image, since our card details need not be stored then) and the TR will generate a token and complete the transaction.What if you have multiple cards and more than one mobile phone? The token that your card network issues is unique to your card (credit or debit), the device and a token requester. If any of these three factor change, there will be a new token that gets generated.How soon can you secure your card?Although tokenisation is not new to India, it isn’t as wide spread. At present, Samsung Pay and a handful of other issuer wallets use tokenisation. But after RBI’s circular, online shopping and e-commerce platforms that otherwise store your card details, will also be allowed to offer tokenization request. These platforms, though, would need to become TRs. Industry officials say not everyone would rush to be TRs as they would need to comply with stringent RBI guidelines as well as spend money to develop the infrastructure. However, small e-commerce platforms may not find it feasible to adapt tokenisation.""A significant investment is required by a merchant to adapt tokenisation. It also requires technical know-how to be able to store these tokens and process this tokenisation transactions, said Sreemoyee Mukherjee, Head-Unsecured loans, BankBazaar.Also, according to RBI guidelines, customers will be allowed to decide whether they want to adapt tokenisation for payment through their mobile / tablets or continue with traditional methods of using physical card to swipe at a store or by storing card details online / on third party apps to complete the payment transactions.In case card is lost, there is lengthy process to get a reissued card from the bank also risks are of misuse by a theft. Where for consumers using tokenisation there is an added benefit of convenience. TR Ramachandran, Group Country Manager, India and South Asia of financial services company Visa explained, “Tokens tied to lost, or stolen mobile devices, can be instantly reissued – without the need to change the consumer’s primary account number or reissue the plastic card.”In guidelines, RBI said the tokenisation should be performed by the authorised card network which includes Visa, MasterCard, RuPay, American Express and Diners Club. Tokenisation facility will only be offered on payment transactions through mobile phones and tablets.According to guidelines, no charges should be recovered from the customer for availing this service."

content,"The year 2009 saw the introduction of Yamaha’s small capacity sports bike, the R15. What followed next was a battle of sheer power and speed. Mounted on a Deltabox frame, with a 149cc single cylinder engine, the baby R1 was a potent track tool, and technologically it was miles ahead of its generation.Becoming the icon of sports bike enthusiasts in India, the R15 grew through the years. In 2014, the R15 resurfaced with an all new avatar. This R15 V2, as it was christened, was an effort to make the R15 even more track focused. This was the reason that the V2 got a beefier set of tires, a split rear seat, and a steeper riding posture.NoneHowever, that did not satiate the entire fan club of the R15, which led to the introduction of the R15-S, which had the perks of the V2, but came with a single seat, like its predecessor. Continuing through the years, the R15 remained a stable and robust competitor to all the bikes in its class.NoneBy the time 2017 came, the world had realised the potency of the bike, as well as the opportunities it presented. Hence, manufacturers like Aprilia, KTM and Honda, came up with their 150cc contenders. But Yamaha, known to not give up without a fight, answered with the third iteration, the R15 V3.0. Armed with a slipper clutch, USD (upside down) forks, LED lights and most importantly, VVA.None"

title,The Zerodha story: How the Kamath brothers built India's largest retail broker
datetime,2019-01-18 14:26:00+00:00
description,"Zerodha started its journey in 2010 with a team of five people. Today, it employs over 1,300 people"
content,"Bengaluru-based online discount brokerage firm Zerodha’s aim has been to make trading barrier-free since it was founded in 2010 by brothers Nithin and Nikhil Kamath. Hence the name Zerodha; it comes from the words 'zero' and 'rodha', the latter Sanskrit for obstructions.Their work has finally paid off as the firm dethroned long-time market leader ICICI Securities to become the largest brokerage firm in India, with nearly 8.47 lakh active clients. The platform sees two to three million trades every day which makes it the largest retail brokerage firm across the world. It adds 50,000 to 75,000 accounts every month.Zerodha brought many firsts in India's broking industry when it entered the market in 2010. It is India's first 'discount brokerage' firm.A discount broker is different from a full-service broker in that it does not offer research services to its client, such as buy or sell recommendations. The cost it saves by not having a full-fledged research team, it passes on to customers via a low brokerage.Zerodha applied a flat fee of Rs 20 for every trade, irrespective of its size with no brokerage fee, which was deemed as quite disruptive by experts at that time in the market. Compared to that, other brokerages used to typically charge a percentage of the traded amount.The startup kicked off with a team of five people, which has now gone up to an employee count of nearly 1,300 today.Credibility and transparency are crucial for any financial services business, Nithin Kamath told Moneycontrol.""It took a long time, it was a slow transition that happened over the last eight years. In our first year, we opened 3,000 accounts. When the cost of any product or service is less, people automatically question the quality. That was a big challenge for us right from the start. We were able to build a community around us, which helped in the long run. Even today we don't spend any money on advertising,” he said.The focus on building a community helped because initial skepticism towards Zerodha’s discount broking model stemmed from the fact that retail investors, who are often clueless about what stocks they should or sell, were not offered any research services.To counter this, Zerodha launched Varsity, a learning module, which has become immensely popular. It also runs TradingQ&A, an active forum were traders and investors, can discuss stock ideas. Then there is ‘Z Connect’ an interactive blog.Nithin invested in a lot of tech startups in a hope to make relations with budding technologists.""The problem we are trying to solve with this is how to grow the capital market ecosystem in India. It can only happen through educating people on a platform which has content and engagement both,"" Nithin said.Over time, Zerodha has used technology heavily to differentiate itself. Its trading platform Kite on web and mobile accounts for more than 10 percent of all retail trading turnover in India. It recently launched Coin, an online platform to buy direct mutual funds.It has also invested in a host of promising financial technology startups. These include Smallcase, which allows thematic investing – for instance, it offers you a readymade portfolio of companies expected to benefit from the electric vehicle revolution. Or Sensibull, an options trading platform."

content,"The mega Kumbh Mela, which began on January 15 and will continue till March 4, is expected to generate a revenue of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for Uttar Pradesh, says apex industry body Confederation of Indian Industry.Although the Kumbh Mela is spiritual and religious in nature, the economic activities associated with it generate employment for over six lakh workers across various sectors, CII said in a report.The Uttar Pradesh government has allocated Rs 4,200 crore for the 50-day Kumbh Mela this time, which is over thrice the budget of the Maha Kumbh in 2013, making the mega pilgrimage perhaps the costliest ever.The hospitality sector aims at employing 2,50,000 people, airlines and airports around 1,50,000 and tour operators around 45,000. The employment numbers in eco-tourism and medical tourism are being estimated at 85,000, says a CII study.Apart from this there will be around 55,000 new jobs in the unorganized sector comprising of tour guides, taxi drivers, interpreters, volunteers etc.This will lead to increase income levels for government agencies and individual traders.Attracting a massive number of foreign tourists from various countries like Australia, UK, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, New Zealand, Mauritius, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, the Kumbh is a festival of the world.""The 'mela' is expected to generate a revenue of Rs1,200 billion for Uttar Pradesh, the state where it is being held, while neighbouring states like Rajasthan, Uttarkhand, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh will also benefit from the enhanced revenue generation with a large number of national and foreign tourists expected to explore other destinations.The Uttar Pradesh government has allocated a hefty amount of Rs 4,200 crore for the Kumbh Mela held in Allahabad, which has become the costliest pilgrimage till date.""The UP government has allocated Rs 4,200 crore for 2019 Kumbh Mela. The previous state government had spent around Rs 1,300 crore for the Maha Kumbh, which was held in 2013,"" state Finance Minister Rajesh Agarwal told PTI.The area of Kumbh Mela has also been doubled to 3,200 hectares as compared to 1,600 hectares in the previous melas.The Kumbh is a unique and massive gathering of both rural and urban population and also has a huge dispersal factor as people travel long distances across the country.In order to house this multitude, authorities have erected a mini-city of more than 4,000 tents. The city is being lit by installing over 40,000 LED lights, say local authorities.Overhauling of key infrastructure is being done, including upgrading nine railways stations and construction of a new airport terminal in Allahabad.The setting up of this new city in the huge Mela area involves 250 km roads and 22 pontoon bridges, which will make it the largest temporary city in the world.The Kumbh, a sacred Hindu pilgrimage, is thus expected to generate direct and indirect business activities, the fruits of which would hopefully benefit the economy not only of Uttar Pradesh, but that of India as a whole, the CII document says.The Kumbh at Sangam city Prayagraj, as Allahabad is now known, dates back to a hoary past, whose first mention of was made some 2,000 years ago by the Chinese traveler Hsuan Tsang who visited India during the reign on King Harshvardhana.Based on a complex astrological calculation, the alignment of the stars determines the time and place of the ‘Kumbh' in one of the following four river-sites: Haridwar, Prayagraj, Nasik and Ujjain.It is a celebration of an ancient tradition — a dip in the holy waters where the mythical Saraswati, Ganga and Yamuna meet.These riverside festivals and the city that springs up around them are attended by millions, making the ‘Kumbh Mela' the largest religious gathering, perhaps the oldest, and the largest temporary city in the world.Learned seers believe that a dip in the waters would endow an individual with religious merit.Masses of devotees gather on the riverbank to attain spiritual enlightenment, some in the belief that doing so will lead them worldly success, others simply to purify their souls.The Kumbh Mela gets its worldwide reputation as a mega-event not only because of the sheer number of people who attend the fair but also for a widespread display of cultural traits of a nation, which is bound by ties of faith and traditions.Around 12 crore people are expected to visit the Kumbh between now and Maha Shivratri on March 4, when the Mela will come to a close on Maha Shivratri day."

content,"Amid the political turbulence in Karnataka, former chief minister and senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah found himself in a fresh controversy after media reports emerged that he had been ""gifted"" a Mercedes-Benz car by his party legislator.The car claimed to be worth over Rs 1.5 crore was allegedly ""gifted"" by Byrathi Suresh, an agriculturist-cum industrialist and a realtor who is one of the richest politicians in Karnataka. Suresh had declared assets of Rs 416 crore in the affidavit filed by him for the 2017 May assembly polls.Latching on to the reports, the state BJP questioned Siddaramaiah and accused him of having ""made enough and more money"" during his ""10 percent government"".The 10 percent barb refers to alleged commission that the party claimed used to be paid during Siddaramaiah's chief ministership. ""Congress MLA Byrathi Suresh gifts Sri @siddaramaiah a Mercedes-Benz car worth 1.5 crore. Wears spectacle costing 2 Lakh. Wore 80 lakh worth hublot watch.Siddaramaiah vere looks like you have made enough & more money during your 10% govt, "" the state BJP tweeted. Refuting media reports, Congress leader and minister D K Shivakumar said Siddaramaiah has not been gifted the car by Suresh, but given for his traveling purposes. ""There is no gift or anything. We sometimes take our friends' vehicle to travel. There is no issue. Is there any record that he has received a gift or anything? Nothing, no record,"" he said.In June 2018 also, Siddaramaiah was at the vortex of controversy after the then minister K J George allegedly gifted him Toyota Land Cruiser with fuel coupons for a year. George, then, had deflected the charges by saying that he had lent the vehicle as Siddaramaiah was uncomfortable traveling long distances in his Innova car.Earlier in February 2016, Siddaramaiah had been mired in controversy over a Rs 70 lakh worth diamond-studded Hublot watch gifted to him.Siddaramaiah later handed over the watch to the then assembly Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa amid an uproar in the House, declaring it a state asset.Both opposition BJP and JDS members had staged a dharna in the well of the House then. Countering the allegations, Siddaramaiah had said the pre-owned ""HUBLOT BIG BANG-301-M"" wrist watch was presented to him by his Dubai-based NRI friend Dr Girish Chandra Varma in July last at Bengaluru as a personal gift."

Cities that will offer the best opportunities for this trend, include Bengaluru, NCR and Mumbai, followed by Hyderabad and Chennai, the property consultant said in a report.According to Anarock data, all major co-working deals in 2018 happened around the CBD (central business district) areas of cities.Nearly 30 percent of the acquisition of co-working spaces in 2018 happened in the size range of 50,000-1 lakh sq ft, followed by 20 percent each of those sized between 10,000-50,000 sq ft and 1 lakh to 2 lakh sq ft area.Puri said the consolidation of co-working spaces too started in 2018 with major acquisitions like One Co.Work acquiring IShareSpace and AltF CoWorking acquiring Noida-based Daftar India.""Breaking all conventional norms, even the big daddies of the corporate world are now scouting for more flexible and cost-effective work spaces so as to cater to the evolved needs of their new workforces,"" he added.On challenges for this sector, Anarock said co-working can also expose organisations to several risks.

We continue to see good recovery in our Banking, Financial Services and Insurance vertical; our BFSI business accelerated further this quarter, growing 8.6% compared to 6.1% in the prior quarter. Growth was led by Energy and Utilities which grew 18.1%; Life Sciences and Healthcare at 15.7%; Communications and Media which grew 10.8% and the Retail cluster grew at 10.5%. Revenue from digital engagements made up 30.1% of our revenue, growth of 52.7 YoY.and India and Latin America grew 9.7% and 7.6% respectively.Coming to Products and Platforms, they continue to do well. Let me first talk about ignio™, our cognitive automation software. Two very important market trends are driving strong demand for ignio™; First, customers are increasingly taking a Machine First™ approach to operations, and moving from point deployments to enterprise-wide adoption of automation. Secondly, customers are moving away from robotic automation to intelligent automation. Having established a very strong client base and references within the first three years of its launch, ignio™ is very well placed to capitalize on these trends. We had 10 new wins in Q3, spread across North America, UK and Europe.In addition, Digitate won several pilot programs, that should hopefully result in larger engagements in the future.TCS BaNCS, our flagship product suite in the financial services domain had 5 new wins and 5 go-lives during the quarter.Our Advanced Drug Development platform had two wins in Q3:of adverse events or pharmacovigilance.in the regulatory space.world’s largest recruitment exam on behalf of the Railway Recruitment Board in India, assessing over 18 million candidates, they had several new customers signing up. Most importantly, the deal sizes are going up and some of the large iON deals are huge even by global standards. One of the contracts signed by iON recently had TCV of over $0.5 billion.Our customer-centric model has meant that we stay very focused and finding newer and newer opportunities to add value to our customers by looking at our customers business in a holistic way. Our full stakeholder services strategy and our deep contextual knowledge of our customers businesses has allowed us to deepen our relationships and gain share. Those of you who follow our client metrics know that quarter after quarter, year after year, there is a steady migration of customers up the revenue buckets.At the end of Q3, we had 45 clients in the $100 million+ revenue band, 8 more than what we had last year same time. Likewise over the last year, we have added 5 clients in the $50 million+ bracket, bringing the total to 99, 8 clients in the $20 million+ bracket, bringing the total to 211, and 55 clients in the $1 million+ band, taking up the total to 996.Let me now cover the financials briefly. Despite the currency volatility during the quarter and slight increases in the cost of doing business in the major markets, our operating margin has been very resilient at 25.6% which is up 0.4% YoY.Aided by a higher other income, our net income margin remained expanded by 0.6% YoY to 21.7%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%. Accounts receivable was at 70 DSO in dollar terms. The net cash flow from operations was ₹86.8 billion which is 23.3% of our revenue and 107% of our net income. Free cash flow was ₹81.5 billion and invested funds as at 31st December stood at ₹438 billion.The board has recommended an interim dividend of ₹4 per share.organization. The proportion of women in the workforce rose further to 35.8% in Q3. Likewise the number of nationalities represented workforce has gone up further to 151.million learning hours on our digital learning platform in Q3. As of December 31st, we have trained over 292,000 employees on Digital technology and over 318,000 employees on Agile methods. These ongoing investments in organic talent development, our empowering and energizing workplace and progressive HR policies have resulted in industry-leading talent retention rates at TCS. Our last twelve months’ attrition in IT services was 11.2% in Q3.trends.Nonedriven by increased spending by banks on areas like next-generation customer experience using micro-segmentation, rearchitecture of data for delivering insights and the adoption for micro services for greater business agility.transformation driven by top line concerns, and the need to participate across multiple segments. Every enterprise is reimagining multiple aspects of its business, some of them more profoundly than others, and looking to leverage technology to differentiate itself in a Business 4.0 world. It is not very hard to see why they are doing it. Technology-based challengers are disrupting multiple industries and causing upheavals. Retail is a sector which has been in the throes of this for some period of time. We have seen that impact on many long-established retail brands whose businesses have eroded and some of them have faced financial stress or even liquidation.Our approach to industries going through such turbulence is to participate very aggressively in our customers’ growth and transformation agenda while remaining vigilant. However, we do have the risk that if something unexpected comes around, like I said - any such stress, we would take some impact from such events, but we believe that the larger opportunity is worth that risk.More importantly, if you look at the strategic responses from the incumbents, there has been a massive ramp up in their technology investment. They have been steadily investing in building up online channels, integrating them with the physical store and the more ambitious ones are looking at how to tweak their business models to leverage their phygital presence to build moats around their businesses and differentiate themselves from pure eCommerce players.initiatives and putting in place operating models and digital architectures that will help them accomplish the goal. We have Pratik here, and for those of you who would like to understand this further, Pratik would be happy to get into more details.The important thing is that whether it is Retail, BFSI or any of the other industry, our participation in the growth and transformation initiatives did not happen by accident or in a day or suddenly. It has been the outcome of a long process of evolution that we have gone through, and it has been enabled by the customercentric organization structure that we adopted in 2008 and which we have been doubling down over the course of the last year.Significant investments have gone into building the necessary capabilities. We have been systematically investing in our research and innovation program and integrating the CTO function closer and closer with our overall business operations.themes across various industry verticals and come up with innovative solutions that we have been showcasing to customers at our innovation centers and customizing them to meet their specific needs. In many of these cases, the outcomes are various forms of intellectual property, some of them which are getting productized and others which are getting integrated into a solution as accelerators and frameworks, but all of which help customers reduce risk as well as time-to-market. So, our service portfolio, enhanced by our R&I capabilities and our IP portfolio, are an integral part of a complex service delivery and service architecture that we are putting in place and allowing us to participate in a very differentiated way in our customers’ growth and transformation agenda.The other element of it is that while the R&I agenda and integration of the CTO side is happening, in many cases the most impactful innovation does not necessarily come from the formal structure. It comes from within TCS teams working with customers at their location. These teams often possess very deep contextual knowledge of the customer’s business that we have been talking about multiple times in the last year or two, and which is often unparalleled even within the customers own organization given the continuity and the longevity of many of our relationships. It is the incremental little innovations that come up on a daily basis in a collaborative, agile workspace, rather than one big idea, that ultimately creates value for customers and ensure that our ability to stay relevant to the customers continuously increases. This flows through into the metrics that you see in our client portfolio and the steady mining that we are able to achieve here.Then there are our alliance partnerships. In addition to close relationships with virtually all the major technology providers, we have been systematically investing into our Co-Innovation Network (COIN™) where we partner with start-ups with promising new technologies that we jointly take to market or embed into the solutions that we build.partners and customers. We are partnering Red Hat to build verticalized cloud native solutions. We have launched a solution for using drones for testing of railway assets and their maintenance in partnership with SAP. Similarly, we have partnered with a customer, Singapore Airlines, to launch a jointly developed solution that transforms airlines’ ground operations using digital technologies. We have also recently partnered with Honeywell and they were speaking about it in the aerospace marketplace that has been built. So, there are multiple instances where we are becoming very strategic partners in this digital business transformation that many of our clients are going through.knowledge, our portfolio of intellectual property and our Business 4.0 Thought Leadership framework are critical differentiators which have helped us gain significant market share as well as mind share. To further strengthen our positioning in this expanding opportunity, we have launched a new sub-brand called TCS Pace™ in the December quarter, which embodies all these differentiated capabilities.showcases, co-innovation network, start-up accelerators, TCS Think Spaces, Academic Research Spaces, Agile Workspaces, etc., which are all designed to ignite collaborative experimentation, research and rapid product prototyping alongside customers, partners and academia.are seeing is on account of our ability to participate in our customers’ growth and transformation initiatives. It shows up not just as industry-leading growth and digital services and strong overall revenue growth in the quarter gone by, but also in our deals and in the pipeline.We had very strong deal closure this quarter, giving us the biggest order book year till date in FY’19. The total value of contracts signed in Q3 was US$5.9 billion. Importantly, the order book has expanded in every segment – whether you look at North America or BFSI or Retail. Our deal pipeline is also looking quite strong, giving us an excellent start into the new year.With that I want to open up the line for questions.NoneNoneNonemacro and its timeframe. Our approach is that that is not a factor that we can control. So, we will participate aggressively in the demand that we see. We are investing to participate and anticipate the pipeline that we have, and pretty much that is the element that you see reflected in our margin picture also.When the demand came about, our intent is to always participate as much as possible. And towards that, the immediate response to it has been to hire into the subcontractor pool – which is the flex pool that is available. If you look at the COR - SG&A breakup, you will find that that line item has expanded by about 60 basis points.additions. In aggregate, we have now hired 27,000 people in the last one year on a net basis. This compares to a net addition of about 7,000 last year. So, we are investing in our own people, we are investing in the flex capacity, and we are investing in making sure that we capture the demand that we see, while keeping an eye out on the overall market. But we see strong momentum and we are going to back the sales team in making sure that we capture it.NoneNoneanybody else. In fact, if anything we are better situated than most participants in that market, whether it be competitors or customers to actually have a better structure and that should result in multiple elements in the market, whether it be pricing or cost rationalizing over time.So, to your question, it’s difficult to say, but we are not wedded to any artificial margin. We will participate aggressively in demand and we will optimize. We do not see a structural challenge to our overall margin perspective, and that is the medium-term view.negative for us. So, we grew 1.8% on constant currency but in rupee terms the growth is about 1.3%. So, the currency impact, both on the revenue line as well as on the margin line has been a net contraction.NoneNoneNoneNoneSpecifically during the quarter, I think IoT, Intelligent Automation, Artificial Intelligence-based Automation, and Blockchain – these are areas where we  have seen lot of new deals. And these are fairly secular in terms of both verticals, as well as across existing customers and new customers. There are new customers who have just signed up with us, specifically for automating their operations and then bringing in intelligent automation into their operations. So, it is fairly secular. The demand pipeline for intelligence automation itself… the whole set of offerings that we have come up with under the Machine First™ approach, with the Machine First™ delivery model, has received very good traction, I should say.Noneonline/offline or omni-channel retail have actually gone up significantly higher, the highest in the last six years. This is a very good testimony that the offline retailers which has a very strong online presence are doing extremely well and are probably taking market share out from the online-only retailers. The good thing is that we participate with lot of these large retailers who have this online/offline presence. Hence, while there are one or two blips here and there, and that will continue, we do see good demand going forward. Thank you.NoneNoneNoneOur commentary is that we see structural stability in our business model and if that business model’s structural stability is not impacted – it can get impacted typically only by competitive pressure coming either from a customer side or from another competitor side or replacement side. Replacement side which had been spoken about can we participate in digital, will we get disintermediated by automation? I think we have more than established that we are actually on top of those curves. In overall relative competitiveness terms, I think if anything we are stronger today than what we were in the past. So, that is where the confidence about being able to maintain stable margin bands is coming from, rather than one-off commentary about some impact that we see or some changes that we see in the market.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNonequarter last quarter. It swung back up, but it is still too complicated to give you a very trend-line based theme. 5G is one big component of the spend that will come, but even that one will take time and it will get manifested not necessarily in CMI alone, but across multiple industries. So, we are well positioned to participate, whether it be 5G, whether it be fiber rollout, whether it be the virtualization of various business models inside the CMI space. But the sector is likely to remain volatile in the foreseeable future.NoneNoneNoneThat is the biggest differentiator and earlier on as I mentioned, the combination of service portfolio that has been constantly invested on to keep it relevant and close integration with both domain assets, intellectual property assets, our product portfolio and very close working with alliance partners and an ecosystem, that is allowing us to participate in complex deal structures.NoneNoneSome of them will be cost-heavy in the beginning but how quickly we can move into a situation where we will be able to draw down depends on how quickly we are able to deliver some of the early milestones. Any of these large projects, one of my own personal experience is that if you do not miss the first three milestones, then the rest of the things will work like a clock.governance that we put in place, and the right level of connects with the right operating, as well as management leadership at the customer side – all these are critical success factors.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneincrementally any new ways to answer it, but let me put it this way; if ever we get to a point where size is the only reason we are not growing, we can very well split ourselves into two companies of equal size, and then continue growing. It is not a basis.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneIncreasingly, among clients there is a greater realization that that is not an easy task to execute on. And if they try to execute on it, they are also participating in the same market with a much lesser capability to actually build the talent pool required for it. So, rational decision making will prevail and some amount of market forces will come into play. But as you rightly mentioned typically these things take time. There is a lag impact to it.So, we are very focused on one thing – we will capture demand and we will bet on our ability to be executing better than others, and our ability to rationalize these cost structures over a medium to long term period.NoneNoneNow different industries in different parts of the cycle, how will decision-making be across industries and across individual companies and industry. That abstraction I think you guys have better access to data to think that through. But retail is a great example of the reality of what we just spoke about.NoneNoneNoneon and trying to see how to make sure that we share with you something that we are confident about, rather than speculating on what is there. But first level answer is, we do not see lengthening or shortening of the deal cycles.NoneNoneNoneYou see that manifest itself in various things – vendor consolidation, cleanup of a lot of maverick spending. All of that gets cleaned up and we participate aggressively in those kinds of scenarios. So, you see the retail kind of scenario where macro headwinds and as the stress result in technology spending, you will see consolidation coming and flight-to-quality in stressed environments, and we participate on both sides of the table.NoneNoneWith that I want to thank you all for joining us on this call today and once again wishing all of you a very happy new year and great weekend."

title,Lucky 7! Companies that jumped into large-cap category from midcap in last 6 months of 2018
datetime,2019-01-21 10:18:00+00:00
description,"During July-December 2018 period, eight companies fell into the mid-cap category from largecap, 13 moved from small-cap category to mid-cap category"
content,"AMFI, in consultation with SEBI and stock exchanges, came out with its half-yearly list of stocks, based on the data provided by Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (MSEI). The list has highlighted seven companies that have entered the largecap segment.According to AMFI, seven companies jumped from the mid-cap category into the large-cap category, based on listed companies’ average market capitalisation (cap) data in the six months ended December 31, 2018.NoneDuring July-December 2018 period, eight companies fell into the mid-cap category from largecap, 13 moved from small-cap category to mid-cap category; and 15 moved from mid to small-cap category.Large-cap stocks which were the clear winners of 2018 are likely to remain on top of the list for investors in 2019 as well, suggest experts. Investors should use the opportunity to get into quality largecaps, they say.“We continue to believe that largecaps is the space we should invest in currently with higher exposure as compared to mid and smallcaps. This largely given the undergoing risk mentioned in the near term even though valuations have corrected,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.“Currently, we are suggesting a mix of portfolio - with 82.5% for largecaps and 17.5% for mid & smallcaps, which can be increased in the future as risk subsides,” he said.Nair further added that this portfolio can focus on stable domestic stories with leadership qualities in industries like consumption, IT, chemicals and export-oriented companies. Value buying stocks in Pharma, NBFCs, Cement & Infra should also be added.NoneNoneAccording to SEBI circular, the first 100 companies in terms of six-month average market capitalisation are considered as large-caps, while the ones that fall between a 101st-250th place in terms of full market capitalization are considered mid-caps, and any company which secures a place above 250 in terms of market capitalisation are considered small-caps.Subsequent to any updation in the list, mutual funds would have to rebalance their portfolios (if required) in line with an updated list, within a period of one month.According to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), assets under management (AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry came in at Rs 22.86 lakh crore in December 2018 as against Rs 24.03 lakh crore in November 2018, a fall of 4.87 percent on a month-on-month basis.The decline likely reflects a quarter-end phenomenon wherein companies tend to redeem assets for advance tax payments. Data shows that in the last 21 quarter-end months, AUM has declined on 19 instances.AUM under Equity (including Equity Linked Savings Schemes, or ELSS), Balanced, and other ETFs came in at Rs 10.73 lakh crore, up 2.84 percent MoM and 6.40 percent YoY.“The mutual fund industry witnessed net outflows of Rs 136,951 crore in December 2018 as against net inflows of Rs 142,359 crore in November 2018. Liquid/money market category saw outflows of Rs 148,906 crore in December 2018 as against net inflows of Rs 136,135 crore in November 2018, ICRA said in a note.“Inflows are cyclical for this category and outflows reflect withdrawing of money by companies, banks and financial institutions at the quarter-end for paying advance taxes,” it said.The Income category’s outflows decreased to Rs. 3,407 crore in December 2018 from Rs. 6,518 crore in November 2018. Inflows in Equity funds (including ELSS) declined 21.49 percent MoM to Rs. 6,606 crore amid volatile capital markets.In terms of sectors, MFs showed interest in utilities, oil & gas, banks and capital goods. These sectors saw a MoM increase in weight.On the other hand, technology, automobiles, healthcare, metals, consumer, telecom and cement saw a MoM decrease in weight, added the report.The top 10 stocks which fund managers bought ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Bharat Electronics, and NTPC witnessed highest buying interest in the large-cap space during December 2018.In midcaps, stocks like Oil India, NBCC, SJVNL, Reliance Infrastructure, and REC witnessed highest buying during October 2018."

datetime,2019-01-21 12:06:00+00:00
description,"Most technical experts feel that it is better to avoid catching the falling knife at current levels, as the stock is in continuation of a downtrend and technically there is no evidence of near-term bottom formation."
content,"NoneHigh valuations, corporate governance issues as well as product recall in the US have posed as headwinds for the company. The pharma major hit a fresh 52-week low on Friday and chances are that it may even slide further.December quarter data suggests that the value of Sun Pharma holding with fund managers declined by nearly 20 percent, Morningstar India data showed.The recent issue which led to a sudden fall in Sun Pharma stock price was a Moneylife report alleging fresh whistle-blower compliant made to market regulator, Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Also, a recent report suggested that Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is voluntarily recalling 13,918 cartons and 1,39,180 vials of Vecuronium Bromide for injection, used as part of general anesthesia, due to the presence of a particulate unwanted matter.NoneThe stock has corrected from Rs 634 on October 1, 2018 to Rs 390.75 on January 18, 2019. It has been in a downtrend for some time now without any meaningful recovery. But, does this fall make it a ‘contra buy’?Well, most technical experts feel that it is better to avoid catching the falling knife at current levels as the stock is in continuation of a downtrend and technically, there is no evidence of near-term bottom formation.Historical price behaviour of Sun Pharma is suggesting that it had the worst phase during the year 2000 when it topped out at Rs 25 only to hit a bottom at Rs 7 with a deep cut of 72 percent. Time-wise it took 13 quarters to consolidate and initiate a fresh bull run.“The current phase is pretty much looking similar to what it did way back in the year 2000. Right now, this counter is in a strong bear grip after hitting a major top around 1200 in April 2015,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.“Since 2018 this counter appears to have resumed its down move from the highs of 678 as it breached the critical support of 435 recently and Friday’s price damage registered a new swing low of 375. Hence, around these levels there doesn’t look like any contra buying opportunity unless it swiftly recovers and stabilises above 435, as it breached all critical supports and heading lower,” he said.Mohammad further added that if 375 is breached, we will not be surprised to see this stock heading to much lower levels with a target of Rs 316. For the time-being, it looks prudent to avoid this stock.The stock is clearly in a downtrend. It closed 6.9 percent lower in October, followed by 15 percent cut in November, another 12 percent fall in December, and so far in the month of January 2019, the stock is down by about 7 percent.The index is finding selling pressure at higher levels. Last month, it consolidated at its long-term support zone in the range of Rs 400–420 and witnessed a modest recovery. However, the said recovery was short-lived as in the last two sessions we have seen a sharp plunge on downside breaking the mention support zone with ease.""The stock is now in continuation of a downtrend and technically there is no evidence of near term bottom formation in the stock. As far as levels are concerned, previous support zone in range of Rs 400–420 can now act as a hurdle on any bounce back,” Rajesh Bhosle, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.“We generally say ‘avoid catching the falling Knife’; we would recommend investors avoiding hunting for the bottom in this stock and instead, any bounce should be used to exit long positions. Investors can instead focus on outperforming stocks within the space, like Biocon, Divi’s Laboratories, which may provide better returns in the near-term,” he said."

The maker of street bikes and dirt bikes is owned by the chief promoter of Austrian brand KTM which in turn is nearly half-owned by Bajaj Auto.“We have half a dozen models coming under Husqvarna. The brand, in our view, will become even bigger than what KTM has become for us,” Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto said while addressing the media on the sidelines of a brand promotion campaign launched in the national capital.Chakan, the Bajaj factory based near Pune that produces Pulsars, will accommodate Husqvarna models also. The plant also exclusively makes KTM range of bikes for Indian and overseas markets.Likewise, for Husqvarna, its parent has decided to shift production of two models Vitpilen 401 and Svartpilen 401 to Chakan with production slated to begin in late 2018 or early 2019.Both the Husqvarna bikes are powered by the same 373cc, 44bhp, single cylinder engine that powers the KTM Duke 390 and the KTM RC 390. Both these KTM bikes are among the six produced by Bajaj Auto from India.“KTM was struggling when it joined Bajaj in 2007. Today, the company has overtaken Harley Davidson in premium motorcycle segment worldwide. But I believe Husqvarna will be even bigger than KTM,” added Bajaj.KTM clocked sales of over 270,000 units last year."

title,Bajaj ready to roll out Qute as 'almost all states' approve quadricycle's sale
datetime,2019-01-21 21:05:00+00:00
description,Qute is essentially a low-cost version of the modern-day taxi whose pricing would be between that of a three-wheeler and the cheapest passenger car.
content,"NoneThis development is a shot in the arm for the Pune-based motorcycle and three-wheeler manufacturer as the company had been pushing for Qute's launch for the past six years.Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said: ""At the policy level, the Qute has got all clearances. We are in the last mile of bureaucracy where the state transport comes into the picture, for instance, what will be the registration fees, etc. So it is really the tail of the elephant that is left. Almost all the states have approved it and rest of the documents should be laid to rest by March. So Qute should be seen on the roads from March onwards.""An electric version of the Qute will be made ready in the next couple of years alongside the launch of an electric three wheeler, confirmed Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, on the sidelines of  unveiling a new brand campaign 'World's favourite Indian'.The Qute is essentially a low-cost version of the modern-day taxi whose pricing would be between that of a three-wheeler and the cheapest passenger car. The government gave the permission for the creation of a new segment following Bajaj's aggressive and sustained push.A few months ago, Bajaj Auto dealers in Kerala and the North East had already placed orders for the four-wheeler as it considered those markets where it was 'technically' possible to offer the Qute for sale.Last year, the central government cleared the policy to permit quadricycles for commercial use after the Supreme Court asked Centre to look into the issue.Several public interest litigations (PILs) were filed by various entities to stall the commercial launch of the quadricycle. The Qute could potentially replace the three-wheeler (commonly known as autorickshaw) where the market leader is Bajaj Auto.Unable to sell the vehicle in India, Bajaj began exporting the Qute to Latin America, Europe and Africa in 2015. The vehicle is powered by a five-speed, 216cc engine that develops a peak power of 13.2 PS and has a maximum speed of 70 kmph. It can seat three passengers and a driver.Bajaj has created a capacity of 60,000 units per year for the Qute at its manufacturing facility in Aurangabad. According to senior Bajaj officials the production capacities for three-wheelers can be used to produce the Qute as well."

title,'Playing the market on Budget day is like taking the Kiki challenge'

description,"A week before the budget, start watching sectoral movements. Zero in on liquid sectors (Nifty, Bank Nifty and Nifty IT as on date) that are witnessing voluminous buying with the rise in prices"
content,"Sunil V TinaniPlaying the markets on the Budget day is like doing a Kiki dance alongside a moving, driverless truck. Either you’re crushed under the tyres, or arrested for being a menace to the society.Yeah, Budget days are extremely dicey to initiate a trade. Check how the markets behaved on budget days up to 2017, and therein lies a tale of wars that were lost and of pyrrhic victories.You’d notice that 2018 is missing from the numbers below, and that’s because 2018 post-budget was a horror show.NonePost Budget day in 2018, the Sensex lost 800+ points intraday. The Nifty lost 250 points, and the resultant crash lit funeral fires beneath many portfolio holdings.NoneFortunately, all that is behind us.We are now in an election year and, naturally, a whole lot of goodies are expected from the budget.What if these goodies are not announced?But what if the goodies are announced and yet the fiscal deficit gets kayoed? Point is, we are uncertain as to what is contained in the Finance Minister's budget briefcase.Therefore, to stay safe on Budget day trading, here are some pre-Budged days strategies that will help you stay profitable or financially unharmed on a fateful day:CALL SPREADS IN INDICESInformed analysts analyse massive volumes of data and place their short-term bets before the Budget.Retail investors do not have access to such data and, therefore, the thing to do is to become street-smart and game the big boys.Here’s what you should do:NoneNoneNoneFor example, if you witness buying in the banking sector, and if the spot price is 27,300, then buy a BNF 27,500CE for the nearest expiry and sell a BNF 27,700 CE for that same expiry.NoneFor example, if you witness selling in the banking sector, and if the spot price is 27,300, then buy a 27,100 PE for the nearest expiry and sell a 26,900 PE for the same expiry.The number of lots you trade in depends on your trading style.If the trade goes your way, you will pocket the difference in premiums. If it goes against you, you will lose the premium difference.Either case, the loss or profit will be limited. You will get your fill of trading thrills and yet not lose megabucks. Most likely, you will gain because you have spotted the trend in advance. Remember to square both positions at the same time.STOCK OPTIONS STRATEGYThis is a repeat of the strategy listed above except that it is played for individual stocks that are part of illiquid indices such as Nifty PSU Bank, Nifty Private Bank, and a few others.You need to check trending sectors (as suggested above) and pick on stocks that are witnessing heavy volumes with the rise in price or stocks that are witnessing a fall in price accompanied by heavy volumes.After shortlisting a couple of stocks, you should apply the same strategy as above.For example, if you feel a stock is bullish, buy a near CE and sell a far CE. If you feel a stock is bearish, buy its near PE and sell a far PE (on the lines of the example mentioned above).SECOND GUESSING THE BUDGET PROPOSALS:It’s a no-brainer that in an election year, every FM showers goodies and subsidies on businesses that are not doing well.Therefore, you need to make educated guesses about business sectors that are hurt by an economic slowdown and make educated guesses.As on the date of writing this article, it is well known that the agriculture, exports, and the MSME sectors have been pummeled by the economic downturn.The MSME sector stocks are typically listed on the SME boards of NSE and BSE and these are highly illiquid stocks. And you cannot be playing in illiquid stocks.Therefore, relatively safe sectors to pick on this year seem to be agriculture and exports.NoneNoneNow, before you invest on Budget day, know that the full impact of the Budget is analysed a day after and that analysis sets the trend for the market.Going by the historical data, and experience, investing in stock on the budget day can be a bad idea. Therefore, short-term players should work with options, and medium and long-term investors should enter after the trend is set a day or two later.NIFTY & BANK NIFTY LONG-STRANGLE OPTIONS STRATEGYThe Nifty and Bank Nifty swing wildly on Budget day and a 100-point swing happens in the usual course of business.It makes solid sense to enter into a long-strangle trade for both these indices.A long strangle implies buying equidistant out-of-the-money CEs and PEs and waiting for volatility on a budget day to swing the trade in your favour.For example, if Nifty is 10,900 a day before the budget, you can buy an 11000 CE and a 10,800 PE and hope for massive volatility on budget day. Likewise for Bank Nifty, where you can buy CE and PE that is ±200 points from the spot price.TECHNICAL SETUP FOR BUDGET DAYThere actually is no ideal technical setup for the budget day and it would be very risky to trade on lower time frames because trends can change with every announcement.Still, here is set up on the 1-hour charts:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneLet us assume that January 18 is the budget day and plot this setup on the charts:NoneHow to play the strategy:Buy when the price on the 30-minute charts crosses above the VWAP so long as the volumes are above the 10-MA. This indicates a rise in price is accompanied by a rise in volumes (bullish).Sell when the price on the 30-minute charts crosses below the VWAP so long as the volumes are above the 10-MA. This indicates the fall in price is accompanied by a rise in volumes (bearish).Use the VWAP as the primary signal and the pivot points as confirmatory signals. So, if the price crosses above VWAP with the rise in volumes, it is a buy, and when it crosses Resistance 1, it is confirmation of the trend and then can work as the target level, and so on.Despite this technical setup, my advice to you would be to stick to options spreads or strangles on budget day. Also, stay away from making investments on budget day. Understand the impact, watch the trend on the next day, and then buy.Therefore, trade on the budget day by second-guessing the trend and sectors before the budget day, make your moves (options) a day in advance.Now you can dance the Kiki.Sunil V Tinani is a Chartered Accountant and Investor who has been investing in the equity markets since 1985.

datetime,2019-01-21 17:28:00+00:00
description,The government wants to complete the process of privatisation before Lok Sabha elections 2019 and thus have invited bids till February 14
content,"NoneAccording to the report, German airport operator, AviAlliance; Australian AMP Capital; Canadian Brookfield Asset Management and PSP Pension fund; Sydney based Macquarie Group; French airport operator, Aeroports de Paris; and Italy’s Atlantia group have bought the bid documents for six airports.Centre has decided to privatise and have a public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement at airports in Jaipur, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru. These are being privatised after Delhi and Mumbai airports were last privatised in 2006.According to the request for proposal (RFP) floated by the government last month, the concessionaire will be responsible for “operations and management of the existing airport assets, as well as for designing, engineering, financing, construction and development of the further/additional air-side, terminal, city-side and land-side infrastructure for the airport”. The bidding criteria has been decided as the per-passenger revenue fee.Also read: Global Aviation Summit 2019: Setting pace for exponential growth in India's aviation sector“Global infrastructure funds tend to invest in single, reasonably mature operating assets where no capital expenditure is required. The six airports are already mature properties. With metro airports choked, these airports could see a strong growth drawing bidder interest,” executives from global PE investors told the daily.According to government’s Vision 2040 document for aviation sector, passengers count in the next two decades will touch 1.1 billion from current 187 million annually. This comprises around 821 million domestic passengers and around 303 million international passengers (to and from India).To cater to such huge passenger traffic, Indian aviation sector will have to bank on newer airports as incumbent metro airports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru) will saturate. This, according to the document, will push airport count to 200 from 99.According to the report, the six airports on the bidding block are mature airports, handling “wealthy, middle class” passenger traffic in developed cities, which makes them a “safe bet” for global investors.“Weak balance sheets of Indian infrastructure firms are an opportunity or the deep pocketed investors as they are lured by the prospects of acquiring properties at deep discounts,” another executive told the paper.According to the report, as domestic infra-developers are reeling under the burden of excessive debt, global investors will “exploit the opportunity” by bidding aggressively for these airports. This is also the reason why government owned National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) might bid for the airports.Also read: Centre to invite bids for privatisation of six airports by mid-December“We are talking to infrastructure companies that want to bid for the airports but do not have the financial leverage. But our condition is that we are not going to be passive investors,” a senior executive from NIIF told the paper adding that it was planning to raise “a third fund worth $2 billion to invest in infra projects”.The government wants to complete the process of privatisation before Lok Sabha elections 2019 and thus have invited bids till February 14. The deadline, however, has not gone down well with the investors who feel that “such huge investments need board approvals which is a long process”.“This bidding date is aggressive… We asked the government to push the deadline ahead but they have refused,” executives from the firms told the daily."

Similar services are active in Konkan (Dabhol-Dhopave and Dapoli-Bankot), Goa and Kerala.The government plans to launch a seaplane service for Mumbaikars to travel to some famous travel destinations in Maharashtra. These planes have the capability to land or take-off on water.Though potential routes have not been disclosed, it is said that the seaplane will also be used for offshore oil rigs and emergencies. Officials said the airlines wanted to focus on remote areas.Popular spots like Pawna lake in Lonavala, Aamby Valley, Shirdi Mula Dam, Chakan and Talegaon near Pune, Dhoom Dam in Mahabaleshwar could be accessible by these seaplanes in minutes if not within a couple of hours.Recently, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari took a seaplane ride from Mumbai Airport to Girgaum Chowpatty and covered the distance within seven minutes.Coastal RoadMumbai Trans Harbour Link"

datetime,2019-01-23 16:09:00+00:00
description,This will be a major shot in the arm for the Indian company as it will negate the vagaries in foreign exchange
content,"NoneThis will help negate the vagaries in foreign exchange for the Indian entity as around 60 percent of its current royalty payment is made in yen.Speaking to Moneycontrol, RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki, said, “As new models get launched, the rupee denominated royalty payment to Suzuki will rise. By 2022, all models will get covered under this (rupee).”All new models such as Brezza, Ignis, Swift and Dzire have moved to the rupee system. Since the next generation Wagon R features a new platform, it will also join the rupee pay system for royalty. Other models such as Alto, Eeco, Baleno, Ciaz, Ertiga and Gypsy will progressively move away from yen.A single percent appreciation in the yen hurts Maruti’s earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 1.2 percent, analysts said. As of Q2 end, the company paid 5.7 percent of sales in royalties.Maruti is the single largest profit generator and the highest revenue contributor for Suzuki Motor Corporation. In addition to royalty, the parent also receives dividend and a share in the profits due to its 56 percent stake in the Indian subsidiary.In addition to moving away from yen denominated payments, Maruti is simultaneously boosting its local R&D spends. This will help reduce dependence on the parent company for technology in not just product development but in new engine and transmission technology as well.While a lower royalty would look like negative news for Suzuki, which is making a multi-crore investment for new capacities in India, ever-growing sales in India and exports from here will provide a boost to its topline.For the record, Maruti is targeting sales of 2.5 million units a year by 2023, up from 1.77 million units clocked in 2018. It has consistently pushed new models into the market and simultaneously expanded its retail reach to accommodate its expanded line-up.Suzuki is pushing for hybrid and electric vehicles in India and other parts of the world, riding high on its partnership with fellow Japanese giant Toyota Motor Corporation.The two companies are sharing powertrain and vehicle development technology with a special focus on driving down the initial cost of acquisition of electric and hybrid vehicles."

description,Nissan Kicks launched today at a price of Rs 9.5 lakh and goes up against the likes of the Mahindra Scorpio and Hyundai Creta.
content,"Nissan’s latest entry in the crossover battle, the Kicks, has finally launched today. Loaded with features and driver aides, the Kicks promises to be a tough contender against existing SUVs such as the Hyundai Creta and Mahindra Scorpio. But how does it fare against the competition on paper? Let’s find out.DimensionsThe Nissan Kicks shares its B0 platform with the Renault Captur. This puts it at a length of 4,384mm, which is slightly bigger than the Creta at 4,270 mm long, but considerably smaller than the Scorpio which is 4,456mm long. Regarding boot space, the Creta and Kicks are tied at 400 litres, which are undermined by the massive 460 litres in the Scorpio.Driver AidesThe Nissan Kicks has several segment-leading features including a 360-degree camera. Apart from that, Nissan Intelligent Mobility aides, such as Hill Start Assist, and Vehicle Dynamic Control give it a considerable edge over the rest. Nevertheless, its competitors are also armed with features such as touchscreen infotainment, although the Scorpio does not support phone app connectivity. And though cornering lights and LED DRLs are present in all, Creta and Kicks offer them as standard.SafetyApart from standard safety features such as ABS and EBD, Nissan Kicks also comes with Vehicle Dynamic Control, which takes control of the car in situations of emergency. However, Creta leads the segment regarding safety, as it comes with six airbags as opposed to two which come standard in the Kicks and Scorpio.Engine optionsThe Nissan Kicks shares the Captur’s 1.5-litre engine, in both the petrol and diesel variants. Hyundai’s Creta comes with three engine options including a 1.4-litre diesel, 1.6-litre petrol and a 1.6-litre diesel. The Scorpio on the other hand is available with only a 2.2-litre diesel engine. The Hyundai Creta also features an automatic gearbox for its petrol as well as its diesel variants.Price"

datetime,2019-04-18 07:06:00+00:00
description,Remittance of the salary already deposited in a foreign bank account to bank account in India is not receipt of salary in India
content,"Sanjeev PanditNon-resident Indians, who have an income in India, have to pay the tax also in the country. Under the Income Tax Act, in case of a non-resident, income that is received or is deemed to be received in India or income that accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise in India is chargeable to tax in India.A person employed abroad or deputed by his Indian employer on a foreign assignment or a person employed as a crew on a ship may become non-resident under the income tax act. Such a person may request the employer, whether Indian or foreign, to deposit the salary in his Non-resident (External) bank account (commonly known as NRE account). A question arises whether such salary of a non-resident assessee is chargeable to tax in India.By and large, it is a settled position that salary accrues at the place where services are rendered or employment is exercised. So when services are rendered by a person outside India, the salary accrues to him outside India even though the contract of employment/appointment letter may have been signed in India or the employer may be Indian.If such salary, is deposited in an Indian bank account, does it become chargeable to tax in India for the reason that it was received in India?NoneRemittance of the salary already deposited in a foreign bank account to a bank account in India is not receipt of salary in India.However, where on the instructions of the employee, the salary is deposited for the first time in the NRE bank account, the taxability of such salary has been a subject matter of dispute between the Tax Department and tax-payers.In some of the cases, the appellate authorities have held that when a non-resident earns salary outside India, such salary is available to him or is under his control outside India and that is a constructive receipt of the salary outside India. On that count, the appellate authorities have held that such salary cannot be taxed in India because it is deposited in the NRE bank account.On the other hand, there are decisions of the Income Tax Tribunal holding that if the salary is received for the first time in the NRE bank account of the assessee in India, it is chargeable to tax in India.This issue often arises in cases of persons who are members of crew of the foreign-going ship. Representations were made to the government for clarifying this issue. The Central Board of direct taxes (CBDT) issued two circulars in April 2017 and clarified that in case of a non-resident seafarer, salary accruing outside India will not be chargeable to tax in India merely because it is credited in the NRE account of such person.The circulars, although refer only to cases of seafarers of foreign-going ships, the circulars may be relied upon in case of other non-residents earning salary for services rendered outside India and crediting such salary to their NRE bank accounts in India. Even in their case, such salary should not be chargeable to tax in India only because it was credited to the NRE account in India.NoneAnother aspect that may be kept in mind is that India has entered into agreements with various countries for avoidance of double taxation. If the provisions of the agreement between India and the country where the person has become resident are more favourable than the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the non-resident has the option to choose to be governed by the provisions of the agreement.Taxation laws are never simple and one may unwittingly get taxed or get caught in litigation. While the circulars issued by the CBDT bring some clarity, if a person is going to be a non-resident for a reasonably long period of time, it may be a good idea to open a bank account in the foreign country and deposit all the foreign earnings in such bank account and then remit the required amount to the NRE account in India.This will avoid the controversy as to whether the salary received for employment exercised outside India is chargeable to tax in India if it is credited to the NRE account."

The court had said that it was essential to ascertain how the funds collected from home buyers and financial institutions have been utilised by the embattled company and ascertain if money collected for construction was diverted.Grant Thornton has been asked to examine all documents and bank account details of the companies, promoters and directors from 2006, sources told Moneycontrol.Last week, advocate Pawanshree Agrawal --  also amicus curiae -- said that out of the 74 construction projects as many as 61 were incomplete.

The return flight would depart at 2.45 am and will reach Tokyo at 2.55 pm, the airline said.This will be India's first flight to the east Asian country via any southern city.""Launch of non-stop flights from Bengaluru to Tokyo (Narita) will herald a new era of more strengthened economic relation between Karnataka and Japan. With this development not only will tourism flourish in Karnataka and Japan but also many new businesses will be established; thereby creating lots of new opportunities,"" said Takayuki Kitagawa, consul-general, Japan said in a statement.He said that relaxation of visa norms from January would help boost connectivity and movement of people between the two countries."

description,"Lenovo hopes to manufacture over 200,000 units of the new Moto Razr smartphone."
content,"Motorola is reviving the once-popular Moto Razr phone with a foldable screen. This new foldable smartphone might be called the Moto Razr V4 and is unlikely to be a feature phone. Motorola is planning to adopt the same flip design of their old Razr feature phone to create a new full-fledged foldable smartphone with a similar flip mechanism.The Motorola Razr phone first made its debut in 2004, long before the days of the smartphone. The Moto Razr, then an ultra-thin flip phone with a futuristic design, was seen as a status symbol touted by celebrities. The Razr revived a failing Motorola and allowed them to once again compete with the likes of Nokia and Sony Ericsson. The Moto Razr marked the beginning of the ultra-thin, flip phone revolution; a revolution that ended in 2007 with the release of the first iPhone.The Lenovo Group, which bought Motorola Mobility handset business from Google in 2014, has announced a partnership with Verizon Communications Inc. on an exclusive deal to begin the selling new Razr devices in the US. It is unclear if this new breed of smartphone will be sold outside the US; one can only hope and wait. Verizon is partnering with several smartphone manufacturers in the race to release smartphones compatible with faster 5G networks."

title,Havells India Q3FY19 review – Strong performance across all business verticals
datetime,2019-01-23 17:34:00+00:00
description,None
content,"NoneNone ------------------------------------------------- NoneNoneKey positives- Favourable revenue base along with a strong consumer demand across all its business verticals drove the overall topline growth for the quarter.- Revenue growth of 31 percent in the Cables & wires segment was largely volume driven (up 24-25 percent YoY) aided by strong demand from infrastructure and power sectors.- New product launches (water purifier, water heaters etc.) along with market share gains in some of its existing product categories aided the growth in the Consumer durables segment.None- Lloyds’ business posted a robust quarter on the back of higher TV and AC sales. Havells through its brand development and distribution is trying to reposition Lloyds from a mass brand to a mass premium brand.- The management expects the growth momentum gained in previous quarters to continue into Q4. Further, metal prices have cooled off in recent months and should support a recovery in margins in the coming few quarters.Key negatives- The operating profits grew 12 percent, despite the topline growth in excess of 20 percent, as the high commodity costs led to a 160 bps contraction in margins. The same, however, improved slightly on a sequential basis.- The management has indicated a slight contraction in consumption (in certain pockets) due to liquidity crisis emerging from IL&FS issue. The liquidity situation continues to improve and demand should normalise over the next couple of months.- Inventory for Lloyd’s business continues to remain at elevated levels. A weak Q1 (unseasonal rains in most regions of India in summer), followed by a sluggish Q2 (due to monsoons), has caused an AC inventory build-up across the trade channels.- The company has witnessed a sharp jump in intangibles after the acquisition of Lloyd’s business. The balance sheet at the end of December 2018 shows intangible assets worth Rs 1,473 crores, which is near twice its FY18 net profits.Other DevelopmentsNoneOutlook and recommendation- A strong quarterly performance on almost all fronts reinforces our faith on the execution capabilities of the management.- Over the past couple of years, Havells has gained a strong foothold in the sector with the launch of new products and gain in market share across segments. The company seems well positioned to benefit from an expanding distribution network and increased brand visibility.None"

title,Job-hopping a common trend among Indian employees: Survey
datetime,2019-01-23 17:14:00+00:00
description,Employers consider job-hopping as a display of lack of loyalty.
content,"NoneThe survey said that women employees are less likely to hop jobs in the short term when compared to their male counterparts.""The growing trend is more visible amongst the millennial workforce, with 56 percent of respondents having job-hopped in a short duration at least once,"" the survey added.About 85 percent of those who hopped jobs said that they would add a job to their resume regardless of how long they had stayed in that role.The survey said that while job hopping is not a new one, the Indian workforce is seeing a climb in project-based work and contract work, which is fuelling a willingness to switch roles more readily.Why do they switch jobs?The most popular reasons for leaving a role in a short period of time were that the job did not live up to expectations (30 percent), it was an unhappy work environment (29 percent), or they were offered a better role elsewhere (38 percent).As per the survey, 49 percent of respondents saw job hopping as an opportunity to learn new skills and over 43 percent stated job hopping could help boost their resume or identify greater job prospects.The trend is more visible in mid-sized companies with 200-500 employees, in comparison to smaller organisations. Interestingly, ‘stickiness’ seems to be higher in traditional sectors of manufacturing with 49 percent of respondents in manufacturing & utilities having never voluntarily left a role after a short period of time. This is in comparison to 40 percent of respondents working in the IT & telecom sectors.Employers despise job-hoppingIn contrast to the attitudes of job seekers, employers continue to believe that frequent job movements are indicative of indecisiveness in a candidate and demonstrate a lack of loyalty.About 87 percent of employers surveyed stated that they had chosen not to interview a candidate in the past due to a history of short-term jobs. It therefore comes as no surprise that people who job hopped more frequently felt that they were missing out on jobs.In the survey, 69 percent of respondents who had changed jobs twice in the last five years stated they had been overlooked in roles they were qualified for, due to their history of job hopping.However, whilst employers may take a different view towards job hopping, staying in the same role does not always indicate the right job fit. Although 44 percent of respondents stated they have never job-hopped in the past, 7 in 10 respondents also reported that they had stayed in roles longer than they wanted to in order to avoid being perceived as a job hopper.""The millennial workforce is an interesting cohort and the world is always curious about their next move. Employers need to devise ways in which they can retain and continue to attract this talent pool,"" said Sashi Kumar, Managing Director, Indeed India.Those surveyed considered a short period of employment to be 16 months or less."

content,"NoneThe company has already developed an electric version of its existing range including the Tiago and Tigor but stopped short of going ahead with a full-scale commercial launch because of the limited charging infrastructure in the country.The electric version of Tiago, Tata Motors' top-selling model, was set to debut in 2017 but was put on the backburner.A senior Tata Motors official hinted at the possible launch of a fully electric vehicle in 2020.“You might see us launching an electric vehicle in 2020. We are not committing to it at the moment,” Guenter Butschek, Managing director, Tata Motors told Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the launch of premium sports utility vehicle Harrier in Mumbai on January 23.NoneIndia’s second largest car maker Hyundai will launch an imported electric SUV in a few months.NoneTata Motors' reluctance to launch an e-car stems from the fact that the charging infrastructure remains grossly underdeveloped in India giving rise to issues such as range anxiety.Tata Motors showcased at the Auto Expo in Greater Noida last year the electric Tiago is powered by an 85-kilowatt motor that makes 200nm of peak torque. The car can accelerate from 0-100kmph in 11 seconds and has a top speed of 135kmph. It has a range of 100 km.Tata Motors has switched to a two-product architecture model from the earlier six-platform model. While the architectures are flexible to provide the company to spin off 12-14 products they are also capable of hosting hybrid and fully electric powertrains."

The company caught the attention of value buyers as the remaining entity, with an established track record of manufacturing, was available at near zero valuations, taking into account 30 percent tax deductions on the gross sale amount.NoneNoneNoneThe balance sheet at the end of March 2018 showed a sum of Rs 313 crore against capital expenditure in a number of promoter group entities with unrelated business interests -- Himalayan Mineral Waters Pvt (Rs 120 crore) and Fedders IT Technology Pvt (Rs 59 crore). However, as per the latest balance sheet, no progress was been made on these investments over a six-month period.NoneNoneThe first and most important learning from this case study is that the management remains the single most important variable that drives all business activity. Although this has been reiterated umpteen times, investors (as minority shareholders) should give utmost importance to the people at the helm and changes in key management personnel needs to be monitored closely.A deeper look in the financials and accounting policies of a company can reveal much more about the company and its future intentions. In case of LEEL, reversal of gains was a presage of deteriorating corporate governance standards and should not have been ignored in first place. The events that followed were rather unfortunate and resulted in significant destruction in shareholders wealth.Also, following the footsteps of large well-known investors can turn out to be hazardous as an individual can easily replicate a portfolio position, but their conviction and risk appetite are often difficult to replicate.NoneFollow @Sach_Pal"

Arsenal had to be content with a 2-2 draw in that fixture, despite twice taking the lead.Since then, Manchester United have parted ways with Mourinho and have appointed former striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as caretaker manager. The return of their 'Baby-faced Assassin' has reinvigorated the club with Solskjaer enjoying a record start to his managerial stint at the club.Solskjaer equalled a record achieved only by Carlo Ancelotti (Chelsea) and Pep Guardiola (Man City) - winning six consecutive Premier League matches at the start of their managerial reigns. If United beat Burnley at the end of the month, then Solskjaer will set a new Premier League record of seven straight wins since taking charge.Arsenal manager Unai Emery overcame back-to-back defeats in his opening two Premier League games to lead the Gunners to a 22-game unbeaten run, which came to an end after they lost to Southampton in December. Since then, he has seen his team get knocked out of the League Cup by arch-rivals Tottenham and suffer embarrassing defeats to Liverpool and West Ham in the League. Arsenal bounced back with an encouraging 2-0 victory against Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium and Emery will be hoping his team can replicate that form against United.Team News                                                                                              United will have to wait to see whether Luke Shaw, Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo are declared fit to compete against Arsenal.

Since most reporters were not aware of the exit from other C-Wing, all waited for CBI officials at B-Wing only.When some journalists tried to enter the office from the B-Wing, they found it locked from inside, even though all the action was going on in the C-Wing.A few staffers of the group were also present inside the office. When asked one of them told PTI that he is an employee but has not been paid for the past four months.Another man said he works in the pantry and claimed to know nothing about the raids."

description,The ISRO said it would take about 90 minutes for the fourth stage to reach the desired orbit.
content,"India successfully launched Microsat-R, a military satellite on board its Polar rocket PSLV C44, from the spaceport here on Thursday, in the first mission for the ISRO in 2019.The Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) blasted off from the first launchpad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at 11.37 pm at the end of a 28-hour countdown.In a textbook launch, the 44-metre tall, four-stage PSLV-C44 soared into the clear and starry night sky majestically and injected the 740-kg Microsat-R into orbit precisely 13 minutes and 30 seconds later.ISRO scientists broke into celebration at the mission control centre here, about 130 km from Chennai, as the Microsat-R was released in a 274-km polar sun synchronous orbit, marking another success story for the space agency.Former ISRO chairmen Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan and AS Kiran Kumar were among those who witnessed the launch.The fourth stage of the rocket with co-passenger Kalamsat, a students' payload, would now be moved to a higher circular orbit, around 450 kms from earth, so as to establish an orbital platform for carrying out experiments.The ISRO said it would take about 90 minutes for the fourth stage to reach the desired orbit.Microsat-R, an imaging satellite, is meant for military purposes, but the ISRO did not give any details about it.Built at a cost of around Rs 12 lakh, the Kalamsat is an experimental satellite for studying the communication system of nano satellites, which can be useful in many fields, predominantly disaster management.The PSLV C44 is the first launch for the country's space agency in 2019.The PSLV-C44, assembled in 30 days, was the first mission of a new variant of the PSLV, called the PSLV-DL, as it was equipped with two strap-on configurations, the ISRO said.Usually, PSLVs were launched without any strap-ons (boosters) or were equipped with six strap-ons fixed around the rocket, but the ISRO, for the first time, used only two boosters for the mission, an official of the space agency said.He added that for the first time, the ISRO placed a satellite -- Microsat-R -- in a lower orbit, at around 274 kms from earth.Contributed by college students and the members of a Chennai-based organisation -- Space Kidz India -- Kalamsat is the first to use PS4 (the fourth stage of the vehicle) as a platform to orbit around the earth.""We have been working on the project for over six years now. These students are from various backgrounds and the youngest one is studying B.Sc Physics,"" Space Kidz India CEO Srimathy Kesan told PTI.Kesan said Kalamsat was the lightest ever satellite to be launched by India.Space Kidz India aims to nurture young scientists.With this, the PSLV, basically a four-stage vehicle with alternating solid and liquid stages, has launched 54 Indian and 269 satellites of international customers.Speaking after the launch, ISRO Chairman K Sivan said PSLV C44 was not just another PSLV. ""There are many firsts and innovations in this mission. First of all, a new variant of PSLV with two strap on is introduced in this mission to enhance payload capability of PSLV beyond core alone configuration.""Second, the PS4 is made out of aluminium tanks in order to reduce cost of (the) PSLV. Another major change, this is the mission having orbit in the lowest altitude where (the) PSLV has flown so far. Yet another innovation, is making PS4 working after it does its function,"" Sivan said.Saying that ISRO's highest priority at present is Gaganyaan, Sivan said the human space mission would be done by December 2021. ""ISRO has taken a major responsibility for placing a man in space by an Indian vehicle launched from Indian soil. It will happen by December 2021."""

description,Gill will take over as the MD and CEO of Yes Bank on March 1.
content,"NoneOn January 24, Yes Bank announced that Deutsche Bank India chief Ravneet Singh Gill will be their new MD and CEO from March 1 onwards. It was a close competition between Gill and Yes Bank’s senior group president Rajat Monga.The bank said that Gill was the number one priority candidate in the submissions made by them to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on January 10.""It was decided that it would be more appropriate to have a fresh set of eyes to review the functioning of the bank,"" said a source. Monga has been with the bank since its inception in 2004.Yes Bank vs Deutsche BankIn October 2017, Yes Bank reported a divergence in gross bad loans of Rs 6,355 crore for FY17. Divergence refers to the difference between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s inspection report and the bank's own report.Following this, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) penalised Yes Bank for ‘violations of various regulations issued by RBI in the assessment of non-performing assets (NPAs). A penalty of Rs 6 crore was imposed on account of asset classification issues and a delay in reporting a security incident across its ATM network in the previous year.In FY16, Yes Bank had reported just a sixth of the bad loans assessed by the banking regulator. During the year, it had reported gross NPAs worth Rs 748.9 crore as on March 31, 2016, while the RBI had asked the lender to classify gross NPAs worth Rs 4,925.6 crore.Gill, too, has been no stranger to controversy. In 2015, the Germany-based Deutsche Bank’ co-CEO Anshu Jain stepped down after a Libor manipulation controversy with the bank also being fined USD 2.5 billion.This was followed by appointment of a new CEO globally for Deutsche Bank. Speculations were rife that the next big step was to reduce retail operations in markets like India. Gill, who was the head of corporate market coverage during that time, did face a lot of questions on this development. Finally, this plan was shelved.Further, the corporate banking experience of Gill was also a reason for him being considered for the Yes Bank position at a time when its asset quality is being closely watched.Loyalty mattersGill who had been associated with Deutsche Bank since 1991 was regarded as a stable candidate for the position. Having worked across various functions till he came the India head in 2012, his track record has been blemish-free.""His re-appointment as CEO of Deutsche Bank India meant that his credentials were minutely reviewed by the Reserve Bank a few months ago. This also gave us the confidence there would be no roadblocks to his approval,"" said another official.Both the external as well the internal panel was of the view that an official who had served at an organisation for atleast one to two decades would be ideal since they would bring more stability to the position. This was coming from the fact that outgoing MD,CEO Rana Kapoor also had been serving in this position for almost 15 years.""Ravneet has handled global corporate clients at a closer level. So, the idea was to get his international expertise to use to help the bank manage its corporate accounts in a more efficient manner,"" the official quoted above said.Internal versus external candidateThe search firm as well as the search panel did face the dilemma of whether an internal candidate or external candidate would be most suitable for the job. Monga was the top contender internally.""We not only look at the legacy of the banks and its strengths-weaknesses, the management changes among peers in the industry were also closely observed. Gill fit the box in all parameters,"" a source explained.From an initial shortlist of about seven candidates consisting of public sector, private sector and foreign bank chiefs, Gill was among the top ones in the list.Later, a formal communication was sent to the shortlisted candidates to gauge their interest. Post that, the shortlist was narrowed down for the committee to do a detailed inspection of the candidate's track record. Here, Monga and Gill emerged as top contenders. A consensus was that an outsider would be the right fit at this juncture.NoneTimelineNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone"

In addition, over 19 percent of the funds released by the government altogether.The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme was commissioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 22, 2015 with the qualitative aim of “changing mindsets regarding the girl child” and the quantitative aim of “addressing the declining sex ratio”. The scheme required three Union ministries to work in tandem — Women and Child Development, Health and Family Welfare and Human Resource Development.According to the answer provided by Virendra Kumar, Union MoS for Women and Child Development in the Lok Sabha, the government has allocated a total of Rs 644 crore for the scheme. Out of this, only Rs 159 crore has been sent to the districts and states.NoneEven though the disproportionate allocation of funds paints a bad picture on the Centre’s seriousness on the issue, Virendra Kumar rejects this argument. In fact, he announced that the government has planned to expand the scheme to all 640 districts in the country.However, the data pointed out by the report tells another story on the intermittent success of the scheme. For instance, in the 53 of the 161 districts covered in the first and second phases of the implementation of the scheme, the child sex ratio has actually declined since 2015. In the remaining districts, the child sex ratio has increased."

When there is less rainfall, the groundwater levels go low until the levels are restored.“Our research shows that groundwater systems take a lot longer to respond to climate change than surface water, with only half of the world’s groundwater flows responding fully within ‘human’ timescales of 100 years,"" Mark Cuthbert, lead author and research fellow at Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Ocean Sciences and Water Research Institute said.He also stated that in many parts of the world, changes in ""groundwater flows due to climate change could have a very long legacy.” He described this situation as an environmental ""time bomb"" because climate change will impact the recharge cycle not only now, but also in the future affect the base flow to rivers and wetlands a long time later.Cuthbert mentioned that the researchers used hydrologic datasets coupled with groundwater model results to analyse on how long the groundwater systems might take to respond to the climate change.He mentioned that Amazon and Florida Everglades, where the groundwater levels are higher, and the climate is humid, maybe the first ones to experience recharge/discharge problems sooner while arid locations like the Sahara Desert might take longer."

Pareek also indicated that some of the existing products of Tata Motors would also be discontinued owing to the BS-VI norms.However, he did not specify the other passenger vehicles that would be discontinued. On the BS-VI vehicles, he said it was a challenge for auto makers as the Supreme Court guidelines do not allow car registrations other than BS-VI after April 1, 2020.""Basically today we (Tata Motors) have 5 or 6 products (in passenger vehicle segment). They will be refurbished and modified. For Industry is the biggest challenge. BS-IV stock should become zero by April 1, 2020,"" he said.

While the industry grew by 4.4 percent.Three years back Tata Motors had market share of 2.8 percent in passenger car segment and it has not reached to nearly seven per cent. Currently it caters only 60 per cent of the car market and aims at covering 90 percent by launching new products by 2021-22.According to him, the lastfestival season was not good in terms of car sales in the country as therewas ""stress"" in the liquidity marketand as a resultpeople getting loans has become ""slower"".On the Electric vehicles, he said though they have technology to develop EVs, there is no enough charging infrastructure available in the country. Pareek on January 24 launched ""Harrier,"" the new SUV from Tata Motors stable in the Telangana market."

He had then helped the BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls.""Former Chief Minister of Gujarat Shankarsinh Vaghela will join NCP in presence of party president Sharad Pawar and senior leader Praful Patel,"" Gujarat NCP president Jayant Patel alias Boski said.""Vaghela ji is a dynamic leader who knows the pulse of state and the country. I welcome his entry into the NCP and it will give a boost to the party in the state,"" he said.The former Union minister is likely to join the NCP on January 29, the party sources said.However, Vaghela has so far neither confirmed nor denied that he will join the NCP.Vaghela's entry into the NCP can lead to a three-way fight on a few Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat if the Congress fails to enter into a pre-poll alliance with Pawar's party.The state has 26 Lok Sabha seats and all of them were won by the BJP in the 2014 general elections.Vaghela had left the Congress before the 2017 state assembly polls, after he and a few MLAs supporting him voted against Congress candidate for the Rajya Sabha, Ahmed Patel and backed BJP nominee Balwantsinh Rajput.Vaghela, however, did not join the ruling BJP and put up independent candidates in the state assembly elections held in December 2017. All his candidates had lost polls.Recently, Vaghela had toured various places, including Delhi, and declared that he will fight for removal of the BJP-led government at the Centre in 2019.In 2017, the Congress and the NCP had fought assembly elections separately. The NCP was able to win just one seat in the 182-member assembly.If in 2019, both the parties fail to reach a seat- sharing agreement, then it will be a three-way fight on some Lok Sabha seats where Vaghela and his supporters will contest as NCP candidates, the party sources said.Vaghela is a prominent OBC leader, who started his political career with the BJP.After the BJP came to power in 1995 in Gujarat and chose to make Keshubhai Patel chief minister instead of him, Vaghela engineered a split in the saffron outfit and became the CM in 1996 with outside support of the Congress."

description,A journey of Samsung's Galaxy series smartphones
content,"Samsung is releasing its next Galaxy S Series smartphone on February 20 before the Mobile World Conference. This will be the 10th edition of the premium smartphone, and we look at how the smartphone evolved over the years.NoneNoneThe first ever Galaxy S smartphone was released in 2010. It was nothing like today’s large, smaller bezel screen but a smartphone with a small form factor and big bezels. It ran on Android 2.1 and had an 800 x 480 4.3-inch Super AMOLED display. The phone had a single-core 1 GHz processor with just 512MB RAM. Talking about the camera, the front facing camera was 0.3 MP while the rear camera was 5 MP.Galaxy S2NoneThe second generation of the S series lineup was refreshed in April 2011. It had the same screen as its predecessor but got a processor bump to dual-core 1.2 GHz. The rear camera saw an upgrade to 8 MP while the front camera was a 2 MP camera. The RAM was upgraded slightly to 1GBGalaxy S3NoneNoneGalaxy S4NoneThe fourth Generation Galaxy S was launched with a 5-inch Full HD display with a bump in the processor. It had a 1.9 GHz quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM. The rear camera was upgraded to 13 MP.Galaxy S5NoneLaunched in April 2015, the S5 featured a slightly bigger screen with a 5.1-inch display that was brighter than the previous generation. The processor too was bumped up to 2.5 GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM while the rear camera resolution increased to 16MP.Galaxy S6NoneThe first Galaxy S device to offer two variants was the Galaxy S6 which had a regular version and an edge variant. The standard Galaxy S6 featured a 2560 x 1440 Quad HD Super AMOLED display, measuring 5.1-inches. It was powered by an Octa-core processor where four cores clocked 2.1 GHz while the rest clocked 1.5 GHz. This phone had a 3GB RAM. While the rear camera remained the same as S5, the front camera was upgraded to 5MP.The edge variant of the S6 had the same internals but where it differed was the sides of the display that were curved and used to wrap around the phone to give the illusion of no bezel.Galaxy S7NoneThe standard variant of the S7 was an incremental upgrade to the Galaxy S6. It was launched with two options like its predecessor and saw some changes in the camera and software. The camera got a dual-pixel setup which improved the picture clarity under low-light conditions. It was the first phone to get Samsung’s own payment system, Samsung Pay.The screen on the Galaxy S7 edge was increased to 5.5 inches and had the same dual edge Full HD AMOLED display.Galaxy S8NoneThe first Samsung smartphone to have an Infinity Display, meaning edge-to-edge display with no bezels. It did have tiny bezels on the top and the chin of the phone. The two variants of the phone were different only in terms of screen size and battery. The smaller S8 was a 5.8-inch display and a 3,000 mAh battery while the larger S8+ had a 6.2-inch display and a 3,500 mAh battery. The phone had 4GB RAM and Snapdragon 835 processor and Samsung’s Exynos 8895.Galaxy S9The latest offering from Samsung for its Galaxy S lineup looks the same as its predecessor. However, there were a few changes here and there.The biggest change was in the camera where the S9+ got a dual camera with a dual aperture setup. It was the only smartphone to offer two different apertures at f/1.5 and f/2.4 making it one of the best cameras for low-light conditions.Samsung Galaxy S10None"

content,"Honda’s CBR650F was well-received upon launch in 2015 and managed to pull through for three years when it received an update. However, with an increased gap between the demand and supply of the motorcycle, Honda had to pull it off the shelves before it was appreciated fully. Honda does not intend to leave its place empty though and replacing it is the latest CBR650R. The all-new sports-tourer is slated for launch in India soon.The Honda CBR650F was a sports-tourer and the new gen CBR650R continues with that.

description,Chanda Kochhar’s resignation has helped draw the line under the ructions that held back the lender’s stock price
content,"NoneNoneThis is the latest move in the series of events that have untraveled so far at ICICI Bank after the controversy around Kochhar first surfaced in March last year.Kochhar has been caught up in allegations of corporate misconduct and quid pro quo in sanctioning of loans to the Videocon group. The board, which initially backed its CEO, acted belatedly but appropriately, constituting a committee headed by former Supreme Court Judge BN Srikrishna to probe the matter. While Kochhar’s term was scheduled to end in March, she went on leave in June last year till the probe into her conduct was completed by an independent agency (Srikrishna committee) but finally resigned in October 2018.The latest twist of CBI implicating the former CEO & MD of ICICI Bank shouldn’t come as a shock to investors.The allegations against the former CEO, though unproven, are no casual accusations and are being probed by multiple agencies, including the CBI, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Income Tax authorities, in addition to the internal enquiry instituted by the bank. Possibility of getting an unequivocal clean chit from everywhere is remote.NoneThe FIR also names current ICICI group officials, including CEO Sandeep Bakshi, who were part of the credit (loan sanctioning) committee. While the same may be a part of investigation process, questioning decision takers on a business call gone wrong gives an impression of witch hunting. As a result, CBI’s action can impact incremental credit decisions in the banking industry.That said, merely being named in FIR does not debar Bakshi and other key employees from holding their positions. As such, it will not impact bank’s functioning unless any individual named in the FIR is convicted.The enquiry and CBI’s action is against an individual associated with the bank in the past and not against ICICI Bank or its lending practices. Hence, Kochhar’s resignation allayed investor concerns around corporate governance at ICICI Bank. The positive stock reaction following the announcement of Kochhar’s permanent exit from the bank in October 2018 corroborates this argument.ICICI Bank’s shares underperformed the Nifty since Kochhar’s troubles began at the end of March and continued till her going on leave around mid-June. After her exit on October 4, 2018, the stock has significantly outperformed the Nifty till date.NoneDespite the outperformance, ICICI Bank is still the cheapest corporate lender in the private sector, trading at 1.4 times FY20 estimated book. Investors focus should be on the bank’s earnings trajectory, which will be the key driver of the stock price. With a potential improvement in return ratios on receding asset quality issues, the stock can re-rate sharply over a period of time. Implication of the former CEO doesn’t alter the growth path of the bank. Hence, correction in the stock price, if any, following the negative news flow around Kochhar presents a great opportunity to investors to accumulate the stock.Follow @nehadave01"

description,"The maker of Swift and said average discounts per vehicle in the December quarter stood at Rs 24,300, 30% higher than second quarter "
content,"NoneThe Delhi-based maker of Swift, Dzire and Baleno said average discounts per vehicle for the December quarter were at Rs 24,300 or 30 percent higher than the second quarter when average discount per vehicle was Rs 18,750.“The average discount per vehicle during the nine months ended December was Rs 19,200. Discounts during the third quarter were Rs 24,300 per vehicle. But competition discounts were higher than what we were offering. Q3 was an exceptionally challenging period,” Ajay Seth, Chief Financial Officer, Maruti Suzuki said, speaking to analysts post the announcement of quarterly results.Owing to lesser-than-expected retail demand during the festive period Maruti Suzuki reported just a 1.3 percent rise in domestic volumes to 405,597 units. This is the reason why the company hiked discounts significantly during the third quarter to get rid of high inventory.Officials further said retail demand has not picked up even with the start of a new calendar year.“Markets remain under pressure. Few streaks of optimism which we can see are that being election year people will be spending more given the higher MSP (minimum support price) plus monsoon of last year had been good. Fuel prices have also come down from their peaks. (But) overall pressure continues and growth is still subdued,” said RS Kalsi, Executive Director Sales and Marketing, Maruti Suzuki.At the start of the current financial year, Maruti Suzuki had forecast double-digit volume growth. However, it had to revise projections and settle for high single-digit growth. During nine months so far, the company has clocked 8 percent domestic volume growth at 1.32 million units.Maruti’s growth has beaten the industry growth rate of around 4 percent as against the forecast of 8 percent. The industry is expected to close the year with a 4.5 percent growth compared to last financial year.The silver lining for Maruti Suzuki is the robust booking numbers it has received for its two new launches – Ertiga and Wagon R. As per the management, cumulative bookings for Ertiga has surpassed 55,000 and for Wagon R the bookings have crossed 14,000.“Both the Ertiga and Wagon R have been well received. The waiting period on the Ertiga is 28 weeks. There is no production constraint on the Ertiga, we will gradually scale up its production,” added Kalsi."

The exhaust is also high-mounted on the side.'The Scalpel'The 790 Duke's suspension is handled by a 43mm open cartridge split-function WP fork up front and a gas-assisted WP monoshock with 12-stage preload adjustment at the rear. Stopping power comes from a pair of 300mm discs in the front and a 240mm one in the back. The bike is equipped with switchable dual-channel ABS which also includes a ‘Supermoto’ mode that disengages ABS at the rear wheel. All of this figures in to give the 790 Duke sharp, precise handling leading KTM to nickname it, 'The Scalpel'.KTM India pricingKTM has announced that it will not be manufacturing the 790 Duke in India, although it will be brought to the country via the CKD route and assembled at the Chakan plant. KTM officials have stated that the bike has been developed for easier CKD operations. Also, several components like the LED headlight, TFT screen, suspension, brakes, wheels, tyres and the swingarm can be localised to cut costs."

title,DATA STORY | Tourism accounts for 10% of India's GDP. Here's what helped attract tourists

content,"NoneNonePerception about tourism has changed in recent times, as more people are now looking at travel as a relief from the monotony of everyday life and take regular breaks through the year instead of one long holiday. This apart, measures by the Ministry of Tourism too has helped promote tourism within the country.NoneNoneNoneNoneHistorically, India has not been a favoured destination for foreign travellers, mainly due to bureaucratic processes and poor infrastructure. There has been improvement on both fronts over the last few years.Electronic visa processing has made life easier for foreign tourists visiting India. The e-visa policy, launched in November 2014 for 44 countries at nine airports, has been extended to 166 countries, 26 airports and three seaports. These e-visas are available for tourism, business, medical purposes and conferences.The visa policy played an important role in attracting higher tourist footfalls into India as reflected in a healthy growth in foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) using e-Visa.The number for foreign tourist arrivals in India jumped 16 percent to 8.8 million in 2016 from 7.68 million in 2014.NoneJanuary-November 2018 were 9.3 million, up 5.7 percent over the same period in 2017.International tourist arrivals in India are forecast to rise to 30.46 million, generating expenditure of $46.71 billion, an increase of 5.5 percent per annum.> Development of tourism infrastructureThe government has been giving priority to developing tourism infrastructure so that travelers have a better experience.Under the Swadesh Darshan scheme, the government has sanctioned close to Rs 6000 crore for 73 projects across 30 states and Union Territories in the country till date.Nine of the above projects were inaugurated between August to December 2018 in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.Facilities such as tourist facilitation centres, eco log huts, craft villages, toilets have been developed at these tourist spots as a part of the above projects.These moves comes amid a growing awareness within the government about the potential of tourism in generating foreign exchange and jobs. Foreign exchange earnings (FEEs) during January- October 2018 stood at $22.37 billion up 12 percent over the same period the year before.Over the past ten years, the travel and tourism sector is known to have created one in five of all jobs across the world and, with the right regulatory conditions and government support, nearly 100 million new jobs could be created over the decade ahead, according to the WTTC report.Alongside, the government has also been working in collaboration with Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under ""Adopt a Heritage Project"", to provide world-class tourist facilities at the various natural/cultural heritage sites, monuments and other tourist sites.> Incredible India website NoneNone"

title,Transcript| Kotak Mahindra Bank Q3 FY19 Earnings Conference Call
datetime,2019-01-30 13:45:00+00:00
description,This is the verbatim transcript of Kotak Mahindra Bank management call with analysts.
content,"This is the verbatim transcript of Kotak Mahindra Bank management call with analysts.Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I am now glad to hand the conference over to Mr. Uday Kotak. Thank you and over to you, sir.NoneOn the big picture, as I look at the situation, I do believe that overall the broader economy in the last quarter has been slower which is reflected in the numbers as well, compared to what appeared in the first half of the current fiscal. There is some sort of overall slowing economic impulse which was particularly visible in the October-December quarter. I do believe the economic impulses in the private sector continue to be slower than what one would like to see at this point of time. And an economy in the private sector which is primarily driven by consumption and very slow private investment despite increasing capacity utilization is something which should be a concern about on a macro basis. But I do feel at the same time with the broader current account in reasonable shape and as long as oil behaves itself, we should hopefully see a more benign interest rate environment in 2019.for the residential piece has also come from the NBFC and the HFC sector. Therefore, I think we need to watch those segments carefully as we go into 2019.And the third of course is the SME segment where I think it is still in the correction phase and with the approach of the government and RBI to find solutions for the SME business; we should hopefully see that play out during the current year.Therefore, these are the three inter-connected segments because there is a fair amount of SME lending also which happens through the NBFC sector as well. So, the real estate, the non-banking financial sector and the SME sector are the ones I would watch closely in terms of credit book of banks in particular.From Kotak Mahindra Bank’s point of view, I am happy to share with you that we are seeing a reasonably robust loan growth and stability after a long time to see a better realization of our risk adjusted margin approach to lending and we have actually seen our NIM expand after a long time in this quarter. We are also able to price our loans in that context more efficiently than we did in the earlier quarters and with an ability to grow the book simultaneously. If you look at our overall bank numbers, they have been pretty robust, our continuing focus on the quality of our book is paying ongoing results with our net NPA now down to 0.71%. I just hope that no new shoe falls in 2019, something which we currently may not be able to look at. Considering some of the uncertainties which we will go through in 2019 we continue to be alert while being open to growing our business at a pretty rapid trot.Our overall revenues in addition to growth in NII, and banking services in particular despite a slowdown in mutual fund distribution has shown a very significant growth, and we are quite pleased with that in terms of the core banking business beginning to sort of drive wealth.Mahindra Bank, if you see, and Jaimin will take you through greater detail, there is very high focus on granular retail deposits and broadly three big areas of focus are CA, SA and Retail TD deposits below Rs.1 crore and they are continuing to grow at very rapid pace compared to the other parts of the deposits. Therefore, the bank’s reliance on wholesale deposits is consistently coming down.on to see how we are able to tighten ourselves on the overall operating cost side as we go forward.third quarter was probably a blip that there was no booking of most of those revenues, we shall see that in the quarters ahead particularly the advisory fee. Of course, capital markets side is dependent on markets so that is more external.On the pure broking businesses, of course, with the overall market volumes, it is reflective of that. But it is something which has been slower than we would like.On the Car finance subsidiary, the car sales and car volumes have been mixed and as a part of our conservatism and prudence both our NBFCs have had a very comfortable journey through this volatile period which the NBFC sector saw between September and December and we were therefore well stacked up on liquidity and some of that liquidity had negative carry which had an impact on the revenues and profits of the two NBFC subsidiaries as well. And of course, in the NBFC subsidiaries, we have been cautious in growing our real estate lending book for the reasons which I have already highlighted to you. But all in all, I do believe our continuing focus on some key health parameters of our financial business and the banking business is the reason why we feel pretty good about the health of our business and continuing momentum in the core banking business. We also see the life insurance business continuing to grow in a much tougher environment while our margins are very much protected and in fact we are feeling good about the level of margins which our life insurance business is having.The Asset Management Company has seen a sharp jump in profits, because we may be seeing some moderation in the whole distribution model where distributors used to be taking disproportionate front end fees which have stopped especially after SEBI circular of October 22nd. So, this is the overall picture.The health of each of our business is in good shape. The financial strength of the balance sheet of the subsidiaries and the parent continues to be in good shape. The overall stress levels in the balance sheet is under control. We feel the growth on the loan side in the 20s as we have guided seems to be very much in place with hopefully improving margin situation which has been reflected in our October-December quarter.With that, I hand it over to Jaimin to take you through the presentation and the specifics.communication we have got from RBI, we have been following that consistently.In this quarter, what would have happened is assuming we sold the same security say at Rs. 98, the other income shows a negative of the two but the other aspect is reversal of provision and as a result the reversal of provision itself is a big negative number. The provision and contingencies as we have explained on Slide #3 of the ‘Earnings Update’ the provision on investments is a negative number of Rs.287 crore which includes Rs.271 crore and in a normal accounting would have taken it as other income. If we do that adjustment, the other income itself has grown up by about 22% and the overall operating profit would show a growth of 23% on YoY basis. Of course, the provisions and contingencies would be higher at Rs.256 crore. The cost-to-income if I make that adjustment would then show up a number of 47.1% as against 50.3% based on the current number.cost has gone up on QoQ basis.again hitting us there, but as Uday mentioned we are keeping that under lot of focus in terms of the other opex. NIMs for the period at 4.33% as against 4.27% in the same period last year.With regards to segmental, this is as defined by the RBI where everything beyond Rs.5 crore sanction goes into corporate banking. The corporate bank clocks PBT of Rs.867 crore for this quarter. The retail bank is Rs.446 crore; retail bank being hit both on the advertisement and the retiral provisions the largest. The treasury and BMU segment clocking Rs.658 crore PBT for the quarter this year. The advances in the bank at Rs.1,96,000 crore overall, about 23% rise the same period a year ago. We have seen growth on YoY basis in the corporate bank, clocking about 26%. The commercial vehicles, construction equipment continuing to grow at 36%. The small business; personal loans, credit cards again showing a robust growth at 36%. The home loan and the LAP business at 24%. The one business which continues to remain flat is the business banking segment which has been flat both on YoY and QoQ basis. Our SMA-2 number at the end of December at Rs.344 crore which is about 0.18% of our overall advances book. Our gross NPA at Rs.4,129 crore which is about 2.07% of our overall advances book and our net NPA at 0.71% of the overall advances book. This was 1.09% a year ago and in effect improved the coverage ratio from 53.5% a year ago to now 66.2%.Our exposures on some specific segments has come down on a sequential QoQ basis. The NBFC exposure, the home finance exposure has come down. Commercial real estate other than the LRD business has also come down; now it is about Rs.4,000 crore, about 1.6% of our overall exposure book.On the Deposit front, as Uday mentioned, we run a pretty strong book there; our CASA at the end of December at 50.7%, this is not including the TD Sweep which is another 6.7% of our deposit base. Our TD below Rs.1 crore, now stand at Rs. 53,000 crore showing about 27% growth on YoY basis. Our average savings account which is daily average of savings account versus the same daily averages for the last year show growth of 34% on YoY basis and the current account on the same lines showing a growth of 19% on YoY basis. At the end of December ’18, we had 1,453 branches. We end the quarter with the balance sheet size of Rs.2,94,000 crore. At the bank level, capital adequacy overall at 18.1% and tier-1 of 17.6%.Just taking some of the digital initiative which we did, we did launch India’s first AI-powered voicebot in the banking sector which is called “Keya” which is now integrated into mobile apps and also on Google Assistant. We also during the month of December had 3 lakhs users on WhatsApp and got about 10 lakhs opt-ins. We are also live now on the Ripple blockchain platform for inward remittance transactions.If we look at the recurring deposits, almost 89% of our recurring deposits are now sourced through the digital platform as well as 68% of our fixed deposits are now coming through the digital platform.Mobile Banking growth in terms of volume on YoY basis showed a growth of almost 200%-plus and in December we recorded the highest UPI transactions in a month which is 31 million for the month. Our transactions on Kay Mall which is both (mComm and eComm) grew almost 200% on YoY basis.The Aadhaar-enabled payment systems, again, the volumes have grown. Salaried personal loans, digital share was 35% whereas the home loans which are also acquired through the digital means have grown significantly.At the Subsidiary levels, Kotak Securities mobile banking cash ADVs have grown 37% during the period. At Kotak Life, large number of policies being sourced through the “Genie” which is a tablet-based end-to-end solution. And in the General Insurance business, the digital volumes have shown almost 90% growth on YoY basis.whereas the securities business brought in about Rs.99 crore for the quarter.Our consolidated advances at the group level at Rs.2,32,000 crore, about 19% rise on YoY basis. As Uday touched upon, the growth of both the auto business as well as the commercial real estate in the subsidiaries has been lower than what has been growing in the bank. Net worth at the group level at Rs.56,000 crore with the book value per share now at Rs.291.On the Life Insurance business, Rs.890 crore of new business premium for this quarter against Rs.831 crores last year. Our ULIPs now share is 23% for the nine months this year versus 35% last year. Our AUM in the Life business is over Rs.25,000 crore and the solvency continues to be a healthy 3.1%.Kotak Securities that we touched upon, lower volumes, lower realization, we therefore had a smaller profit this quarter and recognize that in the last year this quarter there were six transactions which in the ECM category a mix of QIP, IPOs and OFS.At the Group level, our assets under management now crossed Rs.2,00,000 crore as at December end. The asset management company has now got close to Rs.1,40,000 crore as assets under management. The share on both the equity AUM as well as the overall market share has improved during the quarter and we improved our rankings in the overall ratings.Prime and Kotak Investments, as Uday talked about, slower growth on loans, as well as the fact that we had negative carry on the liquidity amount which we had tanked upon, and to that extent we had slightly lower profit this year compared to the last year on both NBFCs.Those were the broad highlights. Open to taking questions.Nonewould be working capital? Secondly on your opening remarks, you did mention about business banking being cautious. So what will make us positive or change our view?Noneterm and short term oriented book. So that was your question on the corporate side.Noneright in the coming quartersNoneNoneNoneNoneof time but maybe future could be little uncertain?NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneis always possible for us to look at. But keep in mind that we are obsessed with building a stable and low-cost liability franchise, that is our obsession number one, over everything else. And we think there is a long way to go for us on that, and at some point of time if it makes sense we can always take that call. And we are also watching at the bank our credit deposit ratio where our mix has changed, but we need a lot more throughput of that retail deposit flow to come to sustain a higher growth and make our credit deposit ratio much more robust for us to be taking that next move.NoneNonemeantime if we do get confirmation that the revised Aadhar Bill gets passed by the Parliament, then it is great, then it is business as normal. On the operating cost, since we really did not do any significant acquisition, those costs have been saved.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNonemy sense is, if we think about banking as looking at a block of one, two, three years at a time rather than three months at a time, we will take decisions which are consistent for a sustainable growth. And on the liability side, I do not think it is even a two, three year picture, it is like how are we going to transform who we are. And then on the asset side we have the ability to get our risk based pricing and be more competitive and aggressive if our stability is stronger. And if there is one thing which the last three or four months has shown, is a deep value of low cost and stable liability over everything else.NoneNoneNoneNoneNonethrough that, but there is lot of volatility out there, so how should we look at it? Like Kotak Mahindra Investments was going steadily in terms of the earnings, all of a sudden, we had seen a dip, same is the case with Prime as well, maybe in terms of the one-off it is largely other income.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNonemoves?Second question on the asset side, any thoughts on the external benchmark which RBI proposes to introduce for retail, mortgage, MSME, personal loans, given not applicable on the corporate loans, relatively larger part of your loan book could be exposed to that? Any thoughts on that side please.NoneNoneAnd as you saw the deposits growth, the TD growth, bulk of it is coming digital now. Therefore a smart branch strategy combined with digital gives us a huge ability to expand the productivity of our low-cost liability and deposit base. And there is a culture, a culture which has been created which is highly focused on liability franchise, is something which takes a long time to build and which is a very different culture from pure distribution culture which is trying to make quick money on mutual fund distributions and insurance sales alone. What was the next question?Nonethe credit deposit ratios of most banks, they are inching up, which is where we are focused on the liability strategy as a very important component of the overall banking strategy.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNonehave moved better.Yes, broadly that is how the real-estate is. But overall if I look, overall view if I take, housing does continue to be slow. The commercial is where we are seeing most cities reaching unutilized, I mean available commercial space is low and we are seeing demand for commercial going up.are quite comfortable at this Rs. 300-odd crore SMA-II book on a loan book of Rs. 1.96 lakh crore, 0.18%. So we are watching it carefully, but at this stage we do not see that as an early sign of something major.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneproposed, the chances that your confidence level of that getting accepted, what could be as investors we could expect out of that?NoneNoneNoneNonejust give some rough proportion mix?NoneNoneNoneNoneNone"

title,Technical Classroom: How to make actionable trading plan using ROC Momentum Oscillator

description,"The price rate of change indicator (PROC) or simply, rate of change indicator (ROC) is a price based technical oscillator which can be displayed along with price chart."
content,"Shabbir KayyumiThe Rate-of-Change (ROC) indicator, which is also commonly referred to as ‘Momentum’, is a pure momentum oscillator. The price rate of change indicator (PROC) or simply, rate of change indicator (ROC) is a price based technical oscillator which can be displayed along with price chart. It calculates the percent change in price between different periods.What is a ‘ROC Oscillator’?Momentum in technical analysis is the rate of change of security prices or indices. There are several indicators based on momentum indicator; however ROC is given highest priority. It is used as a trend identification indicator as well as used to measure divergence in the momentum and price.NoneAs with all oscillators, the ROC can be used to time the market entry into a trend. However, it really becomes most effective when confirming signals or conditions is identified by an additional technical analysis.Construction of ROC OscillatorUnderstanding underlying formula used for construction of ROC helps traders to take prudent decision, while trading complex scenarios. As the name suggests, the ROC oscillator measures the rate of change in price, based on the look-back period. Based on the configurations used, the ROC indicator measures the current price with the price for the look-back period. ROC indicator is calculated using the following formula:NoneIn simple language, ROC takes the current price and compares it to a price ""n"" periods (user defined) ago. The calculated value is then plotted and fluctuates above and below a Zero Line. Usually, closing prices are used to calculate momentum.Working of ROCLike the most momentum oscillators, the ROC appears on a chart in a separate window below the price chart. The ROC is plotted against a zero line that differentiates positive and negative values.Trading Technique:Usage of Trend lines & Divergences is the most effective way while trading with ROC.The practice of drawing trend lines on a stock chart is as almost as old as buying stock itself, but professional traders draw trend lines on the indicators too. Drawing a support and a resistance level at the same time creates a channel of action that helps measure the trend's current strength. One can use trend line breakouts to justify buy or sell signals too.NoneDivergence is common to all oscillators, regardless of what name they go by. A bullish divergence forms when a security records a lower low and the ROC forms a higher low. The lower low in the security affirms the current downtrend, but the higher low in the ROC suggest existing trend is exhausted & about to end.Trend lines and Divergence together are used to develop trading strategy. Key points about it are as below-Buy Signal:-Buy signal is generated after a ROC trend line break out as indicatedOne can use multiple ways to book profit & exit, like ROC again in over bought zone or price trend line breakdown or ROC trend line breakdown, ROC below center line.Sell Signal:-Sell signal is generated after a ROC trend line break down as indicatedOne can use multiple ways to cover short sell trades, like ROC again in over sold or price trend line break out, ROC above center line or ROC trend line break out .(The author is Head - Technical & Derivative Research, Narnolia Financial Advisors)"

title,Zoya sees glittering future for luxury jewellery market
datetime,2019-01-26 21:47:00+00:00
description,"The new boutique of India’s homegrown luxury brand spreads luxuriously over 4,600 square feet."
content,"The luxury landscape is experiencing strong evolutionary undercurrents with changing consumer profiles, government policy and the way luxury players operate, said a 2016 Assocham report.One such luxury player in this space is Zoya, a diamond boutique from the House of Tata that is looking to expand to cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Pune.Currently, Zoya has three stores — two in Mumbai and one in Delhi. It has reopened its flagship store in Delhi, now located in South Extension neighbourhood.Talking to Moneycontrol, CK Venkatraman, CEO, Jewellery Division, Titan Company, said, “Jewellery is no longer about savings. It is no longer about investment. It is about an expression of yourself it is about your individuality.”The new boutique of India’s homegrown luxury brand spreads over 4,600 square feet. Zoya’s 6299 Hollywood Blvd jewellery collection has a unique take on jewellery by drawing its panache from the undying glamour of three iconic Hollywood eras.According to the Assocham report, “Jewellery to suit the needs and wallets of the upper middle class and high net worth individuals is aplenty begging for choice. Innovations reign and design is the king”.Another collection was inspired by the poetic beauty of Kashmiri seasons and its picturesque locations, while ‘Musee Du Luxe’ or Museum of Luxury is a collection that pays ode to the sublime architecture, the rich culture and the inherent joie de vivre of Paris. It blends a modern style palette with vintage charisma, while summery whites paired with Zoya’s PezzoD’Arte, make for a versatile line of 37 pieces inspired by rich Italian history and style. The report also pointed out that designer or luxury jewellery is in great demand in India as the gold jewellery has lost its sheen as an investment vehicle. “Earlier, people would have opted for luxury cars. But now you have homes, holidays, all of which are creating a second lifestyle of luxury, and jewellery is very much a part of it,"" said Venkatraman.""So clearly that is the way that this country (India) will go because of the significant association of jewellery with tradition in India and weddings, but it has remained underdeveloped,"" he added.The rising price of gold is also attracting consumers towards luxury diamond jewellery, and Venkatraman can confirm the trend.  “The more affluent and more discerning customers that Tanishq itself attracts the share of diamonds is much greater. The 20 percent share that we have today is across the Tanishq brand. If I have to look at more affluent and more discriminating segments within the Tanishq’s overall customer branching it would be the share of diamonds,” said Venkatraman. A recent 2018 Assocham study said that India’s luxury market is expected to expand five-fold in next three years and the number of millionaires are expected to multiply three times in five years. "

content,"Dev AshishIn recent years, investing via Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) has become very popular.But SIP isn't a perfect strategy.No matter what you have been told by those who sold you mutual funds, it isn't a risk-free strategy to invest in equities.But nevertheless, it's a fairly good option when it comes to practical utility.Markets don't go in a straight line. They move up, move down, move sideways and what not.So if you invest a lump sum amount, and get your timing right, then you would enter the market at lower levels and have the option of exiting at higher levels.Obviously, the return, in this case, would be maximized. This is the perfect strategy - Buy Low, Sell High. Simple.But the problem with this perfect strategy is in its implementation. You can never be sure of whether you are really buying at a low or will the markets go down even lower.Let’s take a small example to highlight this:Now if someone were a perfect market timer, then they would have known that the bottom of the last real bear market (2008-09) would be set in March-2009.So if this investor had invested Rs 12 lakh in one go in March-end 2009 in the Sensex, its value by December 2018 would have become Rs 44-45 lakh.But this kind of return would have been available only if the investor had the ability to time the market perfectly.Now compare this with the other investor who also wanted to invest Rs 12 lakh. But he got his timing almost ‘perfectly’ wrong and invested all the money in December 2007, i.e. near the peak of the bull market of 2003-2007.The result?The value of his investments by December 2018 would have been Rs 21-22 lakh. The difference between the perfect and imperfect market timing is clearly evident.So buying low is fine if you want to make super returns. But how can you be sure whether you have the skill, the time and the knowledge (and wisdom) to perfectly know when the ‘low’ is.And that is the problem with this theoretically perfect idea of Buy-Low-Sell-High.If you are lucky and invest at the lows (and exit at the highs), your returns will be maximized. But if you aren’t lucky, then you will enter near the market peaks and witness the fall thereafter.To avoid such situations, the concept of investment phasing had been devised. You call it the SIP. And it does reduce the risk of perfectly mistiming by spreading out the investments over a period of time.Continuing our earlier example, imagine that unlike the previous two lumpsum investors, there is a third investor - who too wishes to invest Rs 12 lakh but not in one go.Instead, he opts for Rs 50,000 monthly SIP for 24 months (total investment again being Rs 12 lakh = Rs 50,000 x 24).He begins in Dec 2007 and continues investing till Nov 2009.Any guesses what would be the portfolio value for this investor by Dec 2018?The answer is Rs 32-33 lakh.And what were the values for perfect and imperfect timers?Rs 44-45 lakh and Rs 21-22 lakh respectively.This is exactly why SIP is a practical approach for most common people.They can neither time the market ups and downs perfectly nor bring in the large one-time investment amount.So what’s left for them is to invest smaller amounts regularly- this way, all the investment doesn’t go into the market at just one market level. So the risk of being completely wrong is avoided to a large extent. Of course the opportunity of being perfectly right is also missed. But that is fair given everything that is on offer.And here is a tabular depiction of all 3 investors we discussed above- with portfolio value at the end of each year in between. Spend some time on the table and you will understand the crux of the story:NoneTo put it very simply, the actual value of SIP is not in mathematics but how it disciplines the investor. It is the simplest way of investing regularly without having to worry about whether it is the right time to invest or not.Many feel that since SIP is far from perfect, it can be optimised further by making it start/stop, increase/reduce based on some factors like valuations, market falls, etc.It is true that it can be done. A simple strategy like value averaging would ask the investor to increase SIP amount when markets are down and reduce SIP amount when markets are rising.But varying the SIP instalments is theoretically easy, but putting it in practice is difficult for most investors (unless aided by smart tools). It sounds interesting but it does add a layer of complexity (trying to time the market from within SIP framework) whereas SIP itself was about simplifying investing without the need to time the markets. For most people, the simple SIP is better suited from a practical perspective.To conclude, there is no perfect answer here. If you feel you can time the markets well and bring in large lump sum amounts when needed, then you can avoid going the regular investing route."

content,"Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections due this summer, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 27 said casting vote is a sacred duty and those who do not use the democratic right should feel the ""pain"" of not exercising their franchise.In his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' radio address, he also hailed the role of the Election Commission for its ""meticulous organising abilities "" in holding polls.He pointed out that those born in the 21st century will cast their vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha polls.""They face the opportunity to shoulder responsibilities pertaining to the country. They have embarked upon the journey of being partners in nation building. The time has come for a confluence of individual dreams and the nation's dream,"" he said.He urged the youth to register themselves as voters, if they are eligible. ""All of us must realise that being a voter, earning the right to vote is an important rite of passage in one's life, it's one of its achievements. Simultaneously, the sentiment that voting is our sacred duty, should grow within us naturally. For any reason, if one is not able to vote, it should pain one,"" he said.He said those who are unable to vote should feel saddened to witness any wrong taking place in the country. ""I had not cast my vote ... that day I did not go and vote ... and as a result, my country has borne the brunt,"" he said explaining the feeling.The prime minister said, people have to realise the importance of this responsibility. ""This must be our leaning; this should be our disposition. This inclination should be ingrained within us like a sanskaar (encultration),"" he said.He urged eminent personalities to come forward and jointly contribute in campaigning for spreading awareness on voter registration and casting vote.""I sincerely hope that large number of eligible young people will get themselves registered as voters, thus forging a partnership in the quest to further strengthen our democracy,"" he said.Modi pointed out that on January 25, 1950, the Election Commission came into being, a day before India became a republic.He said, the scale at which elections are held in India is a matter of great awe for the world. He also said it is natural for every citizen to feel proud of the Election Commission and its meticulous organising abilities.He said the country leaves no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India who is a registered voter, rightfully avails of the opportunity to cast his vote.Modi highlighted how polling personnel fan out to remotest corners to enable voters exercise their franchise.""These facts are bound to instil a sense of pride, of the commitment of the Election Commission. Caring for that lone voter, for ensuring that he or she enjoys full opportunity to exercise the right to vote ... this is the beauty of our democracy,"" he said.He appreciated the Election Commission for ""relentlessly"" striving to ensure the strengthening of democracy.""I hold in high esteem, the Election Commissions of all states, security personnel and other staff members who contribute in ensuring strict adherence to free and fair polling,"" he said.Referring to recent Khelo India games, he said only when the local ecosystem or the base of sports will be strong, then only youth will be able to perform their best.""The building of new India does not only involve contribution from the denizens of big cities but also from the youth, children, young sports talents, hailing from small cities, towns and villages,"" he said.Referring to youth and space technology, the PM said, India's space programme has been possible due to innumerable young scientists of the country.He pointed out that satellites developed by students and sounding rockets have reached space.""On January 24 'Kalam Sat' fashioned by our students had been launched. The Sounding Rockets made by Odisha university students have also created many records. The number of successful space missions attempted since the country's independence till 2014 have been equal to those successfully completed in the past four years,"" he said.He also urged people to pay tributes to martyrs on January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi."

content,"KL Rahul scored only 13 on his return from suspension but India A sealed the series against England Lions with a comfortable 60-run win taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. In a low-scoring encounter, India A could manage only 172 in 47.1 overs but then did well enough to bowl out Lions for 112 in only 30.5 overs.On a slow deck, it was left-arm spinners Krunal Pandya (4/21 in 5.5 overs) and Axar Patel (2/26 in overs) who inflicted bulk of the damage.If Axar dealt the opening blows, man of the match Krunal polished the lower-half after chipping in with useful 21 runs.Credit should also be given to Deepak Chahar as his 39 off 65 balls took India from 110 for 7 to 172 after skipper Ajinkya Rahane (0) and Rahul were dismissed cheaply at the top of the order.All eyes were on Rahul, who had a nightmarish two weeks after BCCI's provisional suspension for his comments in TV chat show 'Koffee with Karan'.Having got a long rope during the tours of England and Australia, where he has been an absolute failure, the Karnataka opener didn't do his case any good on his return as he looked completely rusty.His 13 off 25 balls had two boundaries but he was unable to find the gaps during the Powerplay overs. It was seamer Jamie Overton, who dismissed him caught by Zachariah Chappell.Rahul, considered to be a favourite of the Indian team management, will still get two more shots in the ongoing A series.The team management is still undecided on the reserve opener's slot and Rahane with scores of 59 and 91 in the first two games have made a case for himself.In the final two matches, young Rishabh Pant will be opening the batting as he is also a strong candidate for the World Cup berth.None"

title,Returns are never linear in the market

description,What we don’t reckon with is the Volatility in the returns.
content,"Everywhere you go, you hear of long-term investing into equities. Mutual funds are always pushing their schemes at you, market icons are holding forth all the time and preaching is always about long term. So, it has become a fixity for the market- money is made over the long term.No dispute. The efflux of time rights many wrongs. The power of compounding kicks in. Fortuitous events happen. We see the indices on an upward path over the years and are convinced with all of these that the adage is indeed true. A look at the long-term Nifty chart (see chart 1), shows us that except for some periodic dips, the indices have maintained a more or less linear upwardly phased path.Looking at this chart gives us confirmatory evidence that the long-term investing is indeed profitable. All one has to do is to buy and sit tight on the investment and wait for it to come through after some years.NoneAll good so far. Buying something is probably the easiest part. There are enough “sources” around to tell us what to buy. The trouble really is the holding tight part. All of us think that we shall be able to do it. After all, we tell ourselves, we are holding “good” stocks that are “fundamentally strong” and bound to reward over the long term.What we don’t reckon with is the volatility in the returns. While statistics like 15% CAGR give us a feeling that the Nifty will give us a smooth 15% return year after year. Some other statistic like Nifty moved from 1,000 to 10,000, a growth of 10x in the past so many years, conveys to us some multibagger visions, no one is quite prepared to handle the way these things actually happen.For a dose of reality, take a look at chart 2, which shows the annual returns of the Nifty from the year 1995 till now. What jumps out of the picture is the erratic nature of the return. Just as you were enjoying the gains of 1995, you get hit for negative returns for the next two years.While you were wondering whether to get back in, the market flips around and becomes positive return-oriented for successive years! So you get back in the game and are enjoying what looks like a good run and before you know it, all the returns and some more was drained away in a single year(2008).You didn’t even get a chance to recover from that hit before the market sped to an astounding 75% return in 2009. This has been followed by a period of low range (relatively) returns that has also been a bit wayward. Three years of good returns (2012-14) were usurped by 2015 drop and the anemic 2016. The dramatic rise in 2017 set the pulses racing only to find 2018 turned into a damp squib!So, what is one to make of this? The following points should sum it up. It is a list of things that we need to ACCEPT as being REALITIES OF INVESTING.These are important considerations for investing. It is much less romantic and much less exciting than you think. Hindsight bias is high. So is associative bias. One must try to avoid these. That you could have done something in the past is only a possibility that is already lost. That someone else has fared much better or much worse is only a small yardstick for comparison. Both of these aspects do nothing to change the realities for you.At Plus Delta Portfolios, our PMS Service, we try to use an approach that tries to capture a greater amount of return during the up years and seeks to limit the erosion during the down years. We do that using our unique CGM model which we have developed after much research into the markets."

description,"The industry body pleaded that less than 250 mm sized coal should not be supplied through direct rail mode at the SECL sidings and should be allocated through washery or road mode, which are having the facilities to handle such ROM (run of mine) coal."
content,"Flagging lower coal production in Chhattisgarh's Korba Coalfield that contributes around 25 GW to the country's power generation capacity, the Association of Power Producers (APP) has urged ministries of coal and power to resolve issues to augment production, especially contractual.In a letter written to the ministries earlier this month, APP said the entire upto 100 mm sized coal production by surface miners should be dispatched through direct rail mode from South Eastern Coalfields Ltd's (SECL) own sidings and merry-go-round train (MGR), or conveyor belt.The industry body pleaded that less than 250 mm sized coal should not be supplied through direct rail mode at the SECL sidings and should be allocated through washery or road mode, which are having the facilities to handle such ROM (run of mine) coal.The body also said there is a need for immediate action to be taken for resolving the long-pending contractual issues at Korba area.According to the letter, the reduction in surface miner 100 mm coal production has directly impacted despatches to power sector through direct rail mode from the SECL sidings. The overall rake loading has reduced 167 rakes (0.7 million tonne) from 25.5 rakes per day in November 2018 to 19.9 rakes per day in December 2018.It pointed out that there have been severe operational difficulties in rake loading and the scenario for January appears to be worsening.It said: ""Rail programmes of power houses are valid up to the 3rd of the next month February and non-availability of coal in Korba area is forcing power houses to convert maximum quantity to Washery / Road mode. Even after transferring of rakes from rail mode to washery or road mode substantial rakes are lapsing.""According to the association, the overall production in the SECL Korba Coalfield (Gevra, Kusmunda and Dipka mines) was 2.99 lakh tonnes per day during April to November 2018. The production in December 2018 was 2.95 lakh tonne per day.A power company official said the fall in production at Korba mines directly impacting coal supplies to close to 25,000 MW of generation capacity of state-run power giant NTPC, state-owned utilities of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan besides independent power projects of Adani, KSK, GMR, DB Power, RKM, Jindal, SKS and Lanco, among others."

On his way to 149, the former middle-order batsman slammed the fastest ODI hundred in cricketing history.Only a few days back, when India played Australia in the Sydney Test, Indian players were also spotted sporting shades of the pink in some form or the other.NoneAustralian players too replaced their ""baggy green"" with Pink caps.NoneThe third day of the traditional Sydney Test that is played on New Year's occasion is called the ""Pink Day"".  And, just like Wanderers, the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) also goes Pink on that day.So, what is the reason and history behind cricket going pink in Australia and South Africa? The South Africa vs Pakistan ODI was the seventh occasion when the Proteas played a 'Pink ODI'. The tradition started back in 2011.The idea behind holding this Pink ODI is to spread awareness about breast cancer.The South African international cricket team has backed the concept of ‘PinkDrive’ campaign and the main objective of 'Pink ODI' is to unite South African cricket fans and the nation at large in raising awareness and funds for breast cancer.NoneEvery boundary accounted for Rs 1,000, every catch and every six during the match accounted for Rs 10,000. The money raised was then contributed by the official sponsors of the event towards the cause.The report quoted CSA Chief Executive, Haroon Lorgat saying, “PinkDrive is one of our foremost social programmes and proves how sport can play a broader role in society.""NoneOn similar but for a slightly personal reason, Cricket Australia holds the Pink Test in Sydney.Every January, SCG turns into a sea of pink as the annual New Year Test is played in support of a noble cause and in honour of former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath's late wife Jane McGrath, who passed away in 2008 after a four-year battle with breast cancer.Four years after Jane passed away, the Pink Test became a reality in 2012. The money raised during the Test goes to Glenn McGrath Foundation.The McGrath Foundation is a breast cancer support and education charity in Australia, which raises money to place McGrath Breast Care Nurses in communities across the country and increases the awareness about the disease."

Fernandes was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and was bedridden for a long time.While he was known as the ‘rebel leader’ during the infamous emergency era who took on Indira Gandhi and called her a ‘congenital liar’, the former minister was also accused of being involved in a corruption case called as the ‘Coffin Gate’ exposed by a sting operation by Tehelka, a news portal.Fernandes was the defence minister in the Vajpayee-led NDA government when India fought with -- and emerged victorious against -- Pakistan in the Kargil war in 1999.The government ordered to bring the bodies of martyred soldiers in a flag-draped aluminium casket. It signed a deal with US-based Buritrol and Baizarces for the coffins.A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report found many flaws in the procurement of the caskets, which were said to be of poor quality and exorbitantly priced. The size of the scam amounted to a purported Rs 24,000 crore.A charge sheet was filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a CBI court in Delhi.The CBI then registered a case against Fernandes, and several others under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 IPC (cheating) and the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act for alleged abuse of official position for personal gains.Following widespread protests from parties such as Congress, Fernandes resigned as defence minister during the course of the investigation. However, the CBI in its investigation could not prove Fernandes' involvement. The special CBI court eventually gave him a clean chit in 2013.“I needed no ‘clean chit’... The aluminium casket purchase issue had never even come to my table during my tenure as defence minister... let alone my drinking the blood of martyrs, as the Congress accused me of doing,” Fernandes later said after his acquittal."

description, The weakness may be a perfect time to accumulate the stock for the long term
content,"Moneycontrol ResearchNoneBusiness momentum remains strong, with assets under management growing by over 30 percent at the end of December 2018, driven principally by commercial vehicles (CVs), pre-owned vehicles as well as lending to small & medium enterprises (SMEs). Growth in disbursement was in excess of 24 percent.Source: CompanyThe quarter under review saw the lingering impact of the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) crisis and tightness in liquidity. However, the management said there was no funding constraint for M&M Finance, although the company carried some excess liquidity as a precaution. The end-market still looks good, with no pressure on lending yields. Despite the challenges, the company was able to maintain its interest margin.The lending book remains diversified and so is the source of funding, thereby de-risking the business.Source: CompanySource: CompanyAsset quality improvement continues with Q3 witnessing a 10 percent sequential decline in gross non-performing assets (NPAs). Gross and net NPAs at the end of the quarter stood at 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.Some of the important subsidiaries of the company are showing improvement. Mahindra Rural Housing (88.75 percent stake) reported 32 percent growth in after-tax-profit for the first nine months of FY19, with a gradual improvement in asset quality. Mahindra Insurance Brokers (80 percent stake) reported a 46 percent growth in profit after tax for 9M FY19.After a blistering pace of growth in the past, volumes for the automobile industry appear to be on a slow lane and that could impact demand from its end-customers.There was a significant increase in operating expenses in Q3, leading to a surge in the cost-to-income ratio to 39.4 percent from 35.1 percent in the preceding quarter. The management indicated an ex-gratia payment to employees on account of the company’s silver jubilee and some increase in advertising spend.While underlying asset quality has improved, provision cover (provision held against non-performing assets) has actually declined to 26.9 percent from 34.9 percent in the previous quarter. The management, however, maintained that the overall loss given default (LGD) is close to its current level of coverage.The management isn’t too worried about its growth outlook and feels 20 percent asset growth is achievable as most of the products financed are not aspirational but are driven by necessities.On the back of improvement in net interest margin (NIM), productivity and decline in provisions, the management is hopeful of reaching three percent return on assets (RoA) in the next couple of years from the present 2.2 percent.M&M Finance, with its deep rural penetration, has carved a niche for itself. Diversification in asset as well as funding book makes the business relatively de-risked and the marquee parentage insulates it from the funding issues that has engulfed the non-banking financial company (NBFC) space. We see M&M Finance as a vantage player to wean away market share from weaker competition.The decline in credit cost could be a trigger for earnings going forward. While we do not rule out temporary weakness in the stock due to the overall slowdown in the automobile end-market, the weakness may be a perfect time to accumulate the stock for the long term.None"

description,The story of India's affordable car offering to the world.
content,"Touted as the ‘People’s car’, Tata Motors announced that the production of Nano would be stopped and the company would end sales from April 2020. The company stated new safety and emissions rules along with poor sales for the discontinuation of the world’s most affordable car.The company confirmed that the 10-year-old car “in its present form cannot continue production beyond 2019”. There were reports since last year about the company thinking to discontinue its entry-level car due to declining-to-no sales.The ‘Lakhtakia Gaadi’ was an ambitious project by the company’s then CEO, Ratan Tata. It was launched with the vision that families who travel on two-wheelers would replace their bikes and scooters with a Nano.Launched in 2009 with a price tag of a bit over Rs 1 Lakh, the Nano was launched in two variants- a basic model and a luxury version that was priced higher. The car was selling well with the company getting good numbers.There was even a waiting period since the capacity in the company’s manufacturing plant in Sanand, Gujarat had only a capacity to produce 60,000 units per year. Tata sold over 9,000 units of Nano in 2010.However, in 2011, the company only sold 500 units citing many reasons like very poor performance in safety tests and even the car catching fire in Mumbai. This led to a lot of negative publicity for Nano. The car was then misinterpreted as the ‘cheapest car’ that lacked safety features.Following poor sales, Tata Motors decided to upgrade the Nano with additional features. The ‘GenX Nano’ was focused more on the youth and had received graphical upgrades and colours.It was equipped with CVT and better fabrics on seats. It also came with a functioning hatch door that enormously increases the value of the car. There were changes to the front and rear bumper to make the car look more attractive.But all these led to a price hike and the car was sold at an ex-showroom of Rs 2.36 lakh. The company only sold 275 units till June 2017, whereas it sold only three units in 2018. The export figures too were very poor as the company did not ship even a single car internationally last year."

title,Here's why Mohnish Pabrai is betting on Rain Industries stock for next 5-10 years
datetime,2019-01-29 13:02:00+00:00
description,"Rain is a global player in its segment, supplying to some of the world's biggest aluminium producers like Rio Tinto and the US-based Alcoa."
content,"NoneNoneWhile Pabrai is still sitting on a 3x return on his original investment made at around Rs 40 a share in 2015, he believes that the stock is cheap and still holds good potential.To substantiate his point, he looks at the future cash flows of the company relative to its current market price. ""Rain is being valued these days at $560 million (Rs 4000 crore). A bad year for the company would mean floor earnings of perhaps $100 million (Rs 714 crore). A good year may produce more than $250 million (Rs 1785 crore) in after-tax profit. Perhaps average earnings will be $150 million (Rs 1071 crore). However, we have to add to that Jagan’s (Rain’s Managing Director and 40+% shareholder) magic with reinvesting earnings at a high ROE. In that scenario, “floor earnings” may very well be $200 million (Rs 1428 crore) in a few years. Rain is cheap based on estimated future cash flows if the intrinsic value does not increase. It is insanely cheap if earnings are redeployed at a 30+% after tax annual return,"" said Pabrai in his recently published annual shareholder letter.Before we dwell on cash lets understand its business. Rain Industries generates close to 72 percent of its revenue (exports accounting for 85 percent) from calcined pet coke (CPC) and coal tar pitch (CTP), which are the derivatives of crude oil and coking coal respectively. These products are used by aluminium producers.Rain is a global player in this segment supplying to some of the world's biggest aluminium producers like Rio Tinto and US-based Alcoa from its manufacturing facilities in the US and other parts of the world. In the domestic market, it supplies to all the leading players such as Hindalco, Nalco and Vedanta and others.Rain has been a major beneficiary of the upturn in the commodity cycle, particularly aluminium, post-2014 and 2015, in terms of both driving the benefits of higher volumes and better realisations.With the improvement in operating environment and pricing, operating assets started throwing more and more cash thus improving its ability service the debt it borrowed for the capex and acquisitions in the past.In the current year, the company is expected to make a net profit of close to Rs 1000 crore as against, Rs 320 crore net profit in the year 2015. Interestingly, the company has been utilising this cash to reduce its financial leverage. Its interest coverage ratio this year is expected moved to over 4 times as against a low of 1.4 times in the year 2014.Coming back to the utilisation of cash, during the first three quarters of the current financial year (company follow calendar year), the company has already produced close to Rs 1,000 crore of cash profits, which is quite good for a company of a balance sheet size of about Rs 12,000 crore. This is precisely an investment argument that Mohnish Pabrai puts in his letter that if the company can deploy this additional cash at high RoE, the benefits of the same would be visible in the coming years.""In the last 3+ years that we have owned Rain, I have seen Jagan Reddy make one smart decision after another. In fact, I have never seen Jagan make even one dumb decision. He has made very large capital allocation calls over the last 12+ years and they have been flawless. It is a remarkable record. He is a dream manager,"" said Pabrai.A good capital allocator would weigh various options and deploy capital in the deserving businesses and activities that results into maximising shareholders value in terms of creating decent returns; justifiable enough for the equity risk and the opportunity cost.""Every year, Rain is going to hand Jagan $100-$250 million in cash. It will get intelligently redeployed. And each time he’ll probably increase market value by 2x or more of the CapEx spend. It would be very dumb to say goodbye to such a gifted leader and capital allocator,"" he said.Mohnish, who is known for patiently holding on to his multi-baggers stocks, may not say goodbye easily particularly when the business is run by competent managers and intrinsic value much higher than the current market price.Theoretically, at 1.5 to 2 times price to book value, every incremental cash or equity capital deployed in the business through the capex or other means should create incremental market capitalization of 1.5 to 2 times, apart from the value that comes from the existing business.NoneNone"

description,The limit of five acres of agricultural land leaves out many who would otherwise be eligible
content,"The upper limit for eligibility under the new upper caste Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota is income below Rs 8 lakh per annum for a household. But an additional provision in rural areas is that households should not own more than five acres of land.The National Sample Survey Organisation’s (NSSO) report on “Some characteristics of Agricultural Households in India” found that between July 2012 and June 2013, rural households that had 4-10 hectares of land, or 9.9 to 24.7 acres, had an average total monthly income, from all sources of Rs 19,637. In other words, average annual income of this class would be Rs 2.35 lakh. Now this was way back in 2012-13. Six years later, even if we assume the income has trebled, a generous assumption, then annual income of this class would be 7.05 lakh. And yet they would not be eligible for EWS reservation. An urban or metropolitan house in the same income bracket would however be eligible for the reservation, since their income is less than Rs 8 lakh per annum, provided their house is smaller than 1,000 square feet or they don’t own a plot of land measuring a hundred yards or more.That’s not all. The NSSO report also found that those who owned farms of 2-4 hectares, or 4.9 to 9.9 acres, had an average total monthly income of Rs 10,730 in July 2012-June 2013. The majority of this class too would not be eligible for EWS reservations, even if we assume their incomes had trebled since 2013. And this is a class that can hardly be called rich or even middle class in the sense urban India defines it."

title,Did George Fernandes drive Coca-Cola out from India in the 70s?
datetime,2019-01-29 20:32:00+00:00
description,Global beverage major Coca-Cola's decision to exit India in 1977 had more to do with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act.
content,"Former Defence Minister George Fernandes died on January 29 after battling Alzheimer's disease for sometime. He was 88.The anti-Emergency crusader and ""rebel leader"" was the Industries Minister in Morarji Desai's Janata Party government, which came to power in 1977 after trouncing the Congress. Among other things, he is credited with booting out a few MNCs from India, notably Coca-Cola, during the Janata government's brief tenure.But was Fernandes the man responsible for Coca-Cola quitting India in 1977?The countdown to Coca-Cola's impending exit started in January 1974 when the Indira Gandhi government had introduced the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). The law had been created to protect and boost India's paltry foreign exchange reserves.Until FERA was introduced, multinational companies' (MNCs) subsidiaries operating in India were wholly owned by their parent corporations. They would repatriate all profits made from India operations to their parent companies abroad.This hurt India's economy on two counts -- one, the companies were not investing their profits back into the country; and two, they were depleting India's already feeble forex reserves on the way out. When foreign companies take money out of India, they need to convert it into the currency of their origin.One of the provisions of FERA required the Indian subsidiaries of MNCs in low priority industries like consumer goods to dilute their holding in the subsidiaries to 40 percent. They could do this by either issuing fresh shares or selling part of their stake to domestic investors. MNCs in technologically superior industries like pharma and computer hardware were allowed to have a much higher holding. Most MNCs complied with the rule, and diluted their stake, resulting in a bonanza for India's financial institutions as well as retail investors who had the money to invest in stocks.But Coca-Cola had other plans. It initially tried to seek an exemption from the 40 percent rule by claiming that it was a technology-driven company, the technology being the formula to make the concentrate used in the drink. But this argument did not deter authorities.Coca-Cola had been in India since 1950 when it opened its first bottling plant in New Delhi, and by all accounts, was doing well.Industry experts said that Coca-Cola feared if it did not have majority ownership, it would have to share its trade secret with shareholders.Since its founding in 1886, the company's formula for its flagship drink remained one of the most heavily guarded trade secrets in the world.As retired finance ministry official K Subramaniam points out in this column in 2002, Coca-Cola tried to work around the FERA rule by operating two companies in India. One would be a bottling plant in which it would reduce its holding to 40 percent, and the other would be a technical arm which owned the formula for the concentrate.Coca-Cola wanted to hold 100 percent in the technical arm. Reserve Bank of India rejected the proposal and pointed out that FERA guidelines required the entire operations of a branch to be brought under one company with foreign equity capped at 40 percent. This was unacceptable to Coca-Cola, which then decided to pack its bags and leave.In September 1977, then Industries Minister George Fernandes said he had ""no second thoughts"" on the question of allowing Coca-Cola to continue its operations in India, according to a report by New York Times.""Our policy toward multinationals is uniform,"" the report quoted Fernandes as saying, adding that Coca-Cola had to abide by the law of the land if they wanted to do business in India.Coca-Cola alleged that it had decided to exit India as local authorities wanted full disclosure of the formula for making the concentrate. That allegation was not entirely true, though by insisting that Coca-Cola operate only one company, the India regulator did not allow the cola maker to ring fence its secret sauce.After Coca-Cola's exit, several Indian employees of the company were left jobless. To avoid a backlash, the government decided to come up with its own version of Coca-Cola. Fernandes said a 'swadeshi' substitute drink called Double Seven or 77 was ready and would be marketed in a few weeks. The name of the drink had a political undertone as well, since 1977 marked the end of the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, her defeat in the elections, and Janata Party's ascension to power.The government asked the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) at Mysore to develop the formula for Double Seven, to fill the void left by Coke, according to a report by India Times. With this, the government provided employment to those who worked with Coca-Cola.Double Seven, marketed by a government-owned company Modern Food Industries, wasn't a success. The drink faced tough competition from Campa Cola, Thums Up, Duke's, McDowell's Crush and Double Cola.As the Morarji Desai government collapsed in mid-1979, Double Seven lost major market share. The Indira Gandhi-led government which returned to power in 1980 was indifferent to Modern Food Industries. The company soon started incurring losses and stopped manufacturing the product."

content,"George Fernandes, the former Defence Minister of India passed away on Tuesday at the age of 88 in New Delhi. Fernandes was known as a rebel leader for taking on Indira Gandhi during the emergency era.Born on July 3, 1930, in a Catholic family from Mangalore, George was named after the King, George V by his mother due to the same birthdate. During his childhood, he was sent to a seminary to be trained as a Catholic Priest. However, at the age of 18, he left Mangalore and came to Mumbai (then Bombay) in search of a job.He was highly inspired by socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia following which he joined the Socialist Party and got involved with the trade union movement. Fernandes then chose to lead the fight for the rights of industrial labourers working in hotels.He then participated in the 1967 elections and defeated Congress leader SK Patil in parliamentary elections. Following his victory, Fernandes was called as the ‘giant killer’.Despite his newfound success, he still worked for the labour unions and in 1974, Fernandes, who was the president of All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF), called for a nationwide strike with the union. The strike was called citing poor working conditions and continued for 20 days.He was also known as the rebel leader as he openly opposed Indira Gandhi during the emergency which was declared between 1975-77. Fernandes was arrested by the government in 1976, for allegedly blowing up the railway bridges, later called as the Baroda Dynamite Conspiracy. He fought the 1977 Lok Sabha elections as he continued spending time in jail. Post elections, he came in victorious from Muzaffarpur constituency in Bihar.NoneHe started losing credibility after the Janata Party split. Fernandes then formed the Samata Party in 1994 and later after the party’s alliance with BJP, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee assigned Fernandes as the Defence Minister post their victory in 1998.He overlooked the Pokhran nuclear test and the Kargil War. After the Kargil war, his name was involved in the Coffin scam which resulted in the end of his term as the defence minister in 2004. He was also accused of being involved in two other cases— Barak Missile scandal and Operation West End.George Fernandes was last elected as a Rajya Sabha member in 2009-2010.

I don't think that the NCLAT will interfere,"" said a lawyer at a leading legal firm.At the same time, the Ruias can appeal to the NCLAT, and also to the Supreme Court.""A borrower can argue that if they are ready to repay the entire debt including all dues to all the creditors then it’s no more an IBC resolution, not even a settlement but repayment of all the dues by a borrower,"" said Babu Sivaprakasam, Partner, Economic Laws Practice.""It will not be an easy proposition for any party to take a stand that a borrower or guarantor shall be barred from not paying their dues in entirety and once all dues including CIRP costs are fully paid the IBC petitions become infructuous as no resolution is warranted,"" he adds.With the Government and the courts pushing to expedite the resolution process, the end to the biggest insolvency case, is nigh."

The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin is also ahead of peer average. However, the growth has come at a price and the company has accumulated debt on its balance sheet. Despite repayment post issue, there would be substantial debt on the books which could be a concern in down times. The company has an interest coverage of only around 1.3 times.At the higher price band, Chalet’s IPO is priced at an EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to EBITDA) of 25 times in line with peers.While we find the business attractive, the asset-heavy model resulting in heavy debt on the books is a major area of caution for investors. We would recommend only high-risk appetite investors with a long term view to look at subscribing to the stock.Follow @Ruchiagrawal"

title,Looking for multibaggers? Ambit Capital shortlists 30 stocks on basis of six financial parameters

description,Ambit Capital in its latest report Ten-baggers 8.0 came out with a list of 30 stocks which are likely to deliver higher returns in the near future
content,"The most important parameter for generating multibagger returns is stock selection. Stocks which can deliver consistent growth rate normally make that cut.Ideally, a portfolio with an optimum mix of large, mid and smallcap stocks should be able to deliver returns beating the benchmark index, S&P BSE 500.Ambit Capital in its latest report Ten-baggers 8.0 came out with a list of 30 stocks which are likely to deliver higher returns in the near future. The approach is based on ‘greatness’ framework to identify the great firms.The brokerage firm tweaked its methodology in its latest report. Instead of evaluating on the basis of final outcomes such as higher/consistent RoE, RoCE etc., Ambit rather focused on the drivers of these final outcomes.NoneAmbit Capital ranked the BSE500 universe of firms (excluding financial services firms and firms with insufficient data) on their 'greatness' score, which consists of six equally weighted headings — investments, generation of sales, efficiency in capital employed turnover, pricing discipline, balance sheet discipline and cash generation.Under each of these six heads, the brokerage further looked at two things: a) improvement in performance over FY15-18 compared to FY12-FY15, and b) consistency in performance over FY12-18 i.e. over 6 fiscal yearsTo identify the stocks for Ten-bagger 8.0 iteration, Ambit Capital started with firms with the highest ‘greatness score’ which include names like Advance Enzyme, Johnson Controls, CCL Products, Natco Pharma, Jyothy Labs, Timken India, Avanti Feeds, La Opala, Godrej Agrovet, Sheela Foam, and Torrent Power.NoneAmbit Capital also ran a valuation check to ascertain if they are currently trading at reasonable prices for investments. “In our view, whilst valuations do matter on a tactical basis, how the underlying fundamentals evolve for the firm over long periods plays a more important role in determining returns than the beginning-of-the-period valuation itself,” said the report.Further, the performance of the previous iterations of our ten-bagger portfolio corroborates our finding that beginning-of-the-period valuations do not play a significant role in shaping subsequent investment returns.The brokerage firm found that 21 out of 30 firms were inexpensive (on at least two of the three metrics). However, for the long term, all 30 stocks remain candidates to be ten-baggers from Ambit’s perspective."

title,Will single-screen theatres in India become history?
datetime,2019-01-29 21:08:00+00:00
description,"Mumbai, known as the entertainment capital, has seen many single-screen theatres shut shop. The list will soon include Chandan Cinema, which is likely to reopen with multiple screens."
content,"Just before 2018 came to an end, an 80-year-old theatre screened its last show on December 31. Bengaluru's Rex theatre on Brigade Road has met the same fate as many other single-screen theatres like Empire, Liberty, Galaxy, among others.Mumbai, known as the entertainment capital, has seen many single-screen theatres shut shop. The list will soon include Chandan Cinema, which is likely to reopen with multiple screens.According to a 2017 KPMG report, on an average 3-4 percent of single screen theatres have been closing every year. Some media reports estimate that as many as 250-300 single-screen theatres have pulled the shutters down in last five years.So, why are single-screen theatres shutting shop?None""Today they (cinema owners) have to get their licenses renewed on a yearly basis that becomes a challenge. I am not saying don’t put the rules in place but there can be a single window clearance which will be a great boon. Depending on the city you operate in, you could meet up to 50-90 permissions. I am not talking about those who are running 400-500 screens. So I hope they de-regulate it and bring it under one umbrella,"" he explained.In terms of government support for single-screens, he said: ""The government needs to support single-screens by way of some form of tax holiday or subsidies so that they are able to reposition themselves. How the multiplexes were helped in the beginning they had 5 year holiday. If something like this is given to single screen like a three year holiday then it will really allow them to come up and improve themselves, there should be some ease of business in the cinema space,"" added Mishra.Presenting another view on the difficulty of running single-screen theatres, Preetham Daniel, Senior Vice President-Asia, Harkness Screens, feels there are two reasons behind it. First, this was run by an older generation (single-screens) and the second and important reason is real estate.""Some of the properties on which they are located are prime properties. Rex had been dabbing on the fact of converting into a retail sort of format for the last 4-5 years or even longer. They have had other challenges which now they have overcome. So, it is not even a fresh start of shutting down. It is a 5-6 year old thought. Real estate has become such a prime property that running a cinema business in that format doesn't make sense. Some of them have converted into shopping malls,"" Daniel said.He opined that in order to compete against big multiplex operators, they need to invest in upgrading screens.""One way for single screens to adapt is to provide the best movie viewing experience. Single-screens have to invest in upgrading screens. I have walked into theatres where screens are 14-years-old. The life of a screen is 4-5 years old. They have to focus on maintaining the carpet, quality of ushers, etc. As the standards have shot up, single screen owners have to raise the bar,"" he said.According to a 2018 EY report, single-screen cinemas have reduced from 9,710 screens with 91 percent share of total screens in India in 2009 to less than 71 percent share in 2017 with 6,780 screens.At the same time, multiplexes have grown at a steady rate of over 10 percent over last three years due to rising urbanisation resulting in higher footfalls, higher propensity to consume films with rising per-ticket realisation, operational synergies and a shift to experiential led film watching by the Indian audience, the report added.Another challenge for single-screen theatres according to Daniel is “how to get consumers out of their house to watch a movie as people are watching content on OTT platforms. Consumer behavior and expectations have changed – earlier we used to go for movies only to watch movies but now people expect parking space, they would also go for shopping or maybe dinner. This requires multiplex or shopping mall kind of setting.”UFO is doing its bit in bringing about a transformation in the cinema space. The company came up with the concept of Nova Cinemaz which is an asset-light franchisee model. The model has been envisaged to stabilize the demand-supply gap in the local cinema business. It encourages local entrepreneurs to own and operate NOVA branded theatres in various parts of the country. The arrangement includes the franchisee making the primary investment, and then UFO ensuring that the theatre is set up at a competitive cost.Throwing more light on this concept, Mishra said: :We started Nova Cinemaz with a view to increase the screen density across the country what we have seen is that lot of people want to invest in cinemas but for a variety of reasons they shy away from it. One is over regulated environment. There are stories of national cinema chains not opening up for one-two years because of licensing issues. Here we thought of this as an opportunity to walk on both sides of the fence wherein we are able to help land owners or investors to get into the cinema business and help them across the spectrum of designing the cinema, guiding them on the licensing issues and even going forward having a scenario help them at the operational level also. And the way we wanted to do this was make them a partner with us. And ultimately after we have reached a mass of 50-60 cinemas we wanted to go for franchise route as a model.""He also said that Nova Cinemaz helps in revamping single-screen cinemas and get their bearings right. Last year, Nova Cinemaz refurbished Nagpur's iconic single-screen cinema Rajvilas Talkies.Nova Cinemaz is now present in 13 cities with 26 screens, across India.So, does this mean single screens have a chance to survive in India?""In the long-term, it will not be a multiplex scenario because there are certain good single screen theatres like New Excelsior, Libertym which will continue. Single-screen theatres will survive. In the smaller towns also, single screens are surviving. But they have to change,"" he said.On the other hand, Daniel offers a different opinion. According to him,""There is short-term and long term future for single-screen theatres. In the short-term you are going to see single-screens still alive in the long-term we still see the debate that multiplexes will take over the business,"" he said.But presently, what is helping single-screen theatres stay in the game?Digitisation has helped cinema space as whole but single screens have been huge benefactors of this change. So, before digitization to advertise in individually owned theatres an advertiser would have to meet that many theatre owners. This changed after digitization as companies like UFO Moviez and Qube centrally perform the selling, display and serving of advertisements to their respective networks.Explaining this further, Mishra said: ""We have helped single-screens with the entire investment in equipment, maintenance and replacement of the equipment. So that they start getting the films in the digital format. The way we are able to do this is by aggregating the cinemas under one umbrella for the purpose of selling advertising.""According to Daniel, lower taxes and rise in ticket prices are boosting the single-screen theatres.""Tax has actually gone down. There was a point when Bangalore had a 70 percent entertainment tax. The tax structure for entertainment before GST was anywhere between 20-75 percent. And when GST came in it (tax) came down to 28 percent bracket and that got revised a month ago to 18 percent bracket. Tax has definitely come down. The ticket prices have substantially gone up. When 8-10 years ago I was working on financial business models, we used to take an average ticket price of Rs 100 and in about 8-9 years, we are looking at Rs 200 average ticket price. From a percentage growth, we have seen average ticket prices gone up substantially and taxes have gone down. In case of Karnataka, tax has gone down from 70 percent to 18 percent. The lowest tax was 25 percent, which was Chandigarh,"" said Daniel. He also said that “the strongest component single-screens have is that they have the real estate to have the largest screen which is not something a shopping mall can provide today. They have to understand what their USP is and play to their strengths. And play to their strengths by putting in technology, the right projection system, the right sound system, good seats. If these things are taken care of then single-screens can stay in the business and people would still go to single-screens to watch movies.”"

title,Pre-approved loans on your fingertips: Should you go for credit line when in need?
datetime,2019-01-28 09:59:00+00:00
description,Credit line loans can be a blessing when used wisely but can turn into a nightmare if used indiscriminately.
content,"NoneFor instance, for home renovation lumpsum Rs 5 lakh was not immediately required by Rathi. So, he opted for a credit line facility wherein he opted to consume only Rs 3 lakh, to begin with. The interest that got kicked in first was just on Rs 3 lakh of Rs 5 lakh sanctioned by fintech lender.He borrowed the remaining Rs 2 lakh in February 2018 from the same approved credit line. If he had taken a personal loan of Rs 5 lakh from a bank the option of borrowing in parts would not be available, and he would end up paying interest on the entire amount borrowed.Satyam Kumar, Co-founder and CEO of an online platform offering loan products, LoanTap said, “If one is unsure of the total amount that is required for his/her personal need, then it is advisable to apply for credit line also known as personal overdraft loans.”Such credit line facilities are particularly useful in children studying abroad, uncertain medical expenses in the family, for home renovation, wedding expenses, etc.Some of the fintech companies offering credit line loans are MoneyTap, LoanTap, LazyPay, ZestMoney, etc. Several banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) also provide line of credit to their customers, including Citibank, Bajaj FinServe, etc.Using bank’s credit line loan facility one can borrow maximum upto Rs 25 lakh from Citibank whereas by fintech companies like MoneyTap it’s limited to Rs 5 lakh. The maximum limit in credit line loan varies for banks, NBFCs and fintech companies.NoneThe average personal loan ticket size in non-metros is Rs 2.8 lakh compared to Rs 2.55 lakh in metros. Average personal loan size by a male is Rs 2.8 lakh and female Rs 2.73 lakh. According to the report, in 2019 more first-time salaried borrowers in metros and non-metros will go online/use mobile apps to fulfil their borrowing needs.Steps to get a credit line loan using mobile appsAssume you require Rs 3 lakh for a medical emergency in the family. You can apply for credit line loan using mobile apps offering this facility for instant access to money. For instance, you applying for credit line loan from MoneyTap app.First, you need to download an app from Google Play Store and complete a registration process by filling basic details such as age, city, permanent account number (PAN), income to determine eligibility for a credit line. After sharing your details you will be intimated on the mobile app and email about your pre-approved line of credit amount, Fintech Company will schedule know your client (KYC) visit from registered banking partners in the city to verify and collect the KYC documents for final approval. Once you receive the final approval, your credit line is ready to use.The entire process will be completed within 24 hours after registering on the mobile app and submitting requisite documents. Using this app, you can borrow as little as Rs 3,000, or up to your approved limit. The maximum amount you can borrow is Rs 5 lakh. The money is transferred instantly to your bank account linked with the app using immediate payment service (IMPS).Personal loan vs credit line loanIn case of personal loans, the entire approved loan amount is disbursed in the customer's bank account. The borrower pays fixed equated monthly installment (EMI) from the time of disbursement for the entire tenure of the loan. Thus, even if the disbursed loan amount remains unutilized in his bank account, then also he has to pay the interest on the same.In case of credit line loans, the lending institution approves a loan amount for the customer based on eligibility. The customer withdraws only the amount that he requires at a particular time, from this approved amount. Credit line loan limit is set up for a lifetime for a borrower by MoneyTap. However, it can vary with other fintech companies.Customer pays interest only on the amount withdrawn by him. This means if a borrower takes a credit line loan at 11 percent interest rate and withdraws one-fourth of the approved amount, interest will be only charged on the withdrawn amount.The line of credit is automatically replenished upon the payment of the outstanding amount by the individual. The borrower can utilize his pre-approved credit limit multiple times as per requirements. Further, the pre-payment is flexible in credit line loan and customer has an option to service the minimal interest amount every month by the due date.This credit line loans can be given by banks and NBFCs. Fintech companies can only source these loans from NBFCs after getting a final credit approval from them. However, there are fintech companies, who have in-house RBI registered NBFCs offering this facility instantly. Whereas, applying at banks take at least 2-3 days for approval of personal loans after submitting required documents.Repayment of credit line loan can be done in EMIs of 2 to 36 months (varies for fintech companies). Whereas, in personal loan ranges from 1 to 5 years depending on the loan tenure by the bank.Some of the fintech companies do not charge any pre-payment fees in credit line loans. “However, in addition, there may be a withdrawal fee or a one-time activation fee in credit line loan. These fees vary on basis of the customer’s credit profile,” said Gaurav Chopra, CEO and Founder of online financial services platform, IndiaLends.Be cautious about charges with credit line loansFintech companies charges if you don’t repay by your due date. The penalty and charges may vary for fintech companies that you need to know while applying for credit line loans. For instance, terms and conditions of Fintech Company LazyPay are explained below:NoneNoneFor instance, you have an instalment due of Rs 10,000 on March 3 and you aren’t able to repay this amount. The fintech company will add an overdue charge every day after March 5. The charges added each day will be Rs 7.12 if borrower don’t repay.This amount is charged when borrowers’ linked bank account with the loan has insufficient funds to cover the due amount.What you should do?Harshil Morjaria, Mumbai-based certified financial planner of ValueCurve Financial Solutions advised, “While applying for a loan with fintech companies, carefully go through the agreement for terms and conditions. Since, there is a clause that states the lender can demand repayment of the borrowed amount at any time.”Such untimely repayment situations could bring an additional burden of debt on the borrower. Also, compare the rate of interest on loans offered by banks, NBFCs and fintech companies before applying.High interest rates on personal loan and credit line loan are a huge negative. The range of interest rates is between 11 percent up to 24 percent, depending on the creditworthiness, the profile of the applicant, etc.Determine your need before applying for a loan. Navin Chandani, Chief Business Development Officer, BankBazaar.com cautioned, “Do not borrow in excess from a credit line loan or personal loan since they are now easy to apply on tap of mobile phones. Remember that it is a loan that needs to be repaid with interest and is not free money.”Credit line loans are a good option for borrowers to meet their financial needs by paying interest rates only on the borrowed amount from limit sanctioned. But it is a double edge sword. It must be utilised wisely to get the maximum benefit out of it.Chandani advised, “If you are not disciplined regarding financial matters or in case you are not sure about your repayment abilities, it is better to avoid credit line loans.” Like credit cards, credit line loans can be a blessing when used wisely but can turn into a nightmare if used indiscriminately."

title,Investor Diaries: Here’s what a customer visit to a Tanishq outlet tells you -- that its financial statements won't
datetime,2019-01-28 19:50:00+00:00
description,"Based on my experience, I can confidently say, that unlike unorganized jewellers, Tanishq doesn’t befool its customers by making money in any of the illegitimate ways."
content,"Jatin KhemaniThe beauty about being in investing profession is that your mind is always curious and observing even when you aren’t ‘working’. Any occasion — a family holiday, house renovation or wedding — can effortlessly translate into scuttlebutt (primary research) where you experience so many products and services as a consumer, get to interact with dealers and also get to observe your family and other consumers engaging with those products and brands.I had one such wonderful experience recently. There was a wedding in my family and like all Indian weddings, it meant shopping jewellery for the couple, relatives, gifting, etc. My family and relatives have been traditionally dealing with two jewellers in our neighborhood who belong to same community (Sindhi) - one of them specializes in gold jewellery and other in diamond studded.This time my family wasn’t happy with the designs these two stores offered and so they visited six-seven other mom & pop stores only to find none as a good place to buy from.I was then consulted to suggest a jeweller, and being in stock markets and having read so much praise about it, I instantly suggested Tanishq (India’s leading jewellery brand operated by Titan, a Tata company).The suggestion was instantly turned down saying it levies a very high making charge (a common perception among masses buying jewellery from traditional/unorganized channel). I had never been to a Tanishq store earlier so I did not want to lose an opportunity to visit. Luckily, I found online that during that time period Tanishq was offering up to 30% discount on the making charges which helped me convince my family to give this place a try.What transpired next is an amazing set of experiences which I am going to share in this postWe visited a store about three kilometers from our residence – it must be 12,000 square feet spread over four-storey building. There was a 30-minute waiting as the entire store was full. We were made to sit in the lobby and were promptly served refreshments.The business model of Tanishq is predominantly around ‘making charge’ levied over cost of gold. It varies from 8.5% (on coins) to as high as 35% of the value of gold (on ornaments like necklace or bangles). The quoted rate which we see on financial portals, currently around Rs 32,000, is per 10 grams (equivalent to tola) for 22 karats (a sign of purity, maximum is 24 karat).NoneThe unorganized/traditional jewellers may make money in many other ways - some legitimate, some unscrupulous:1. Their claims regarding their gold’s purity, may not be true and they could very conveniently be selling 18 karat gold at price of 20 or 22 karat, earning the balance 10% or 20% to their pockets, in addition to the ‘low’ making charge they earn from the customers.2. Similarly, when customers exchange their old gold ornaments, they could pay as per 20 karat even though gold is of 22 karat purity.3. Further, they deduct 8-10% from the value of exchanged gold. If one were to return the 20 gm gold ornament illustrated above, he would get Rs 57,600 after 10% deduction from gold value (purchased for Rs 82,400). Jeweller can further short-change by paying less based on purity check.4. They may even peddle this ‘used’ ornament after polishing, to another customer and again earn 10-30% making charge on that same piece.NoneIf one is returning an ornament bought from Tanishq, they will immediately adjust 100% of the value i.e. zero deduction. Every Tanishq ornament has the logo engraved which helps them identify originality.We had an older piece of jewellery to exchange, however, it was a non-Tanishq piece, here’s how they did it:First, the executive placed the ornament in a purity measuring machine called karatmeter. Within 90 seconds, the machine’s display showed us the ornament's purity to be 22 karats.NoneBased on this estimated weight and purity, the executive mentioned the provisional amount to be adjusted in lieu of the gold ornament. Thanks to the machine, we further got a chance to decide whether we want to go ahead with the exchange or not. We chose to go ahead.Then, she added, that the final amount would be based on melted gold. At this stage I was thinking they would keep the gold, send it to some lab and ask us to check what was exact actual weight/purity, in the next visit.To my surprise, the executive took us along to their mini laboratory, where she had our piece of jewellery melted and molded into a brick, right in front of us. Finally, the karatmeter step was repeated to calculate final weight and purity. This entire process took less than 15 minutes. And the transparency with which the process was conducted, only showed how reliable the brand is.Based on my experience, I can confidently say, that unlike unorganised jewellers, Tanishq doesn’t befool its customers by making money in any of the illegitimate ways mentioned.NoneGold ProcurementThere are only three ways a jeweller can source gold – lease it from banks, buy from spot market/import or customer exchange. The most popular has been leasing as it involves no inventory risk, low capital employed, and high return ratios.However, in 2013 amidst worsening current account deficit and rapidly depreciating rupee, the regulator made serious attempt to curb gold imports by banning gold lease and introducing 80:20 import rule which mandated only up to 80% of imported gold can be sold domestically while rest has to be exported.The sector was badly hit and companies had to raise debt to buy spot gold which not only increased their working capital but also brought down return ratios drastically in addition to introducing inventory risk in the business model.NoneIn 2013, the gold exchange contributed merely 15% to Tanishq’s overall gold sourcing. While industry was reeling under pressure during the last five years, the trust and transparency which Tanishq enjoys came to rescue. The share of gold exchange has risen to 40% by FY18 and management hopes to take it to 50% by 2023.This has also been a great customer acquisition strategy - customers almost always end up buying at least twice the quantity they are exchanging and with every repeat visit there is an opportunity to up sell.Jewellery retail is a 5,000+ year old industry, is humungous in size and continues to be dominated by unorganized players (standalone/traditional stores). The data shows branded jewellers like Tanishq have been winning market share from weaker counterparts rapidly - over last 15 years the share of organized players has increased from 10% to 25% and is likely to grow to 50% over next decade.None1. We would have visited this store 4-5 times during Nov-Dec and almost every time there was a waiting period of up to 45 minutes. I thought the rush must be because of wedding season however the same shopping street has at least 15 more jewellers and none seem to have had this kind of crowd.2. On our very first purchase, they enrolled us in their loyalty program ‘encircle’ which gives points based on purchases across titan brands of watches, eyewear, accessories etc. including online purchases from titan.co.in. From second purchase onwards, the cashier himself offered to adjust the points against amount due. Their whole customer-relationship-management seemed very well structured; I received an OTP on my mobile to verify redemption. The points do not have any expiry and can be gifted as well. It also includes free services on watches and eyewear besides standard practice of giving special offers on birthdays and anniversaries, early access to new designs and schemes.NoneWe ended up doing majority of our purchase from Tanishq and the experience was wonderful. The designs are appealing, steady and suited for every-day wear in line with the trend.In an otherwise shrinking industry, it’s only the credibility built over last two decades that is helping them grow steadily.(www.stalwartvalue.com), a SEBI registered investment advisor."

content,"Stand-in captain Rohit Sharma on January 31, described India's batting performance as ""one of the worst in a long time"" after the visitors were shot out for their seventh lowest ODI total in a shocking eight-wicket loss to New Zealand in the fourth one-dayer. In the absence of talismanic skipper Virat Kohli, who has been rested after the side claimed an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match series, India's much-vaunted batting was dismissed for 92 in 30.5 overs at Seddon Park, Hamilton, with pacer Trent Boult (5/21) bowling a deadly opening spell.""One of our worst performances with the bat for a long time. Something we didn't expect. You got to give credit to the New Zealand bowlers. It was a magnificent effort by them,"" said Rohit after a disappointing outing on his 200th ODI.It was also the lowest total posted by any side on this venue, the previous lowest of 122 also against India's name.Rohit gave credit to the Kiwi bowlers for utilising the conditions to perfection and said Indian batters failed to apply themselves on what was a good Seddon Park wicket.""Something to learn for us. At times, you need to absorb pressure (when asked about how to bat in swinging conditions). We need to blame ourselves for it. Things were looking good at one stage. It was about applying ourselves,"" he said at the post-match presentation ceremony.The skipper said poor shot selection was the cause behind India's terrible showing on Thursday.""Once you get in, things will start to look easier. We played some bad shots as well. It's always challenging when the ball is swinging,"" Rohit said.""We have been enjoying a good run in the limited formats for a number of series. Everyone knows what went wrong. There will be times when it swings and we need to deal with it.""Good teams usually keep ticking the boxes and today we didn't tick the right boxes,"" he added.New Zealand captain Kane Williamson was all praise for his bowlers for their splendid effort of bundling India out under 100.""We didn't expect the surface to behave like this. Nice to restrict them to a 90-odd total. It stood up a little bit and nipped a bit. It spun as well. One of those days, things went well,"" he said.""Credit to the areas guys bowled. We always wanted early wickets, to be able to do that was a real step at the right direction.""Terming his bowlers' effort as ""outstanding"", Williamson said their plan always was to dismantle India's batting unit with swing.""It was swinging, that was a weapon we wanted to use because we were able to put India under pressure, we were able to pick regular wickets.""We exploited the conditions really well and chased down nicely as well. We always play to win and today was an outstanding performance,"" he said.Williamson said any team will only improve by playing against a strong side like India.""Against a team like India, it's going to be a strong challenge. An opportunity to play against best team in the world is a great opportunity to improve,"" he said.Man-of-the-match Boult said it was satisfying to be able to exploit the conditions to perfection against a side like India."

description,"TCS became the third most-valued IT services brand globally, a report said."
content,"Moneycontrol ContributorsNoneTCS, the bellwether of the Indian IT industry, has been in the news for some great results of late. We’d discussed in earlier podcast about TCS breaching the $100 billion barrier to join an exclusive club of worldwide organizations. It was the second Indian company after RIL to do so.  Four Indian IT services companies - TCS, Infosys, HCL and Wipro - made it to the global rankings.Now comes news that TCS is the third most-valued IT services brand globally. That’s right, globally. Brand Finance, a London-based branded business valuation consultancy, releases an annual list of Brand League tables, segmented by region or sectors. And this year, Tata Consultancy Services has been ranked the third most-valued IT services brand globally in 2018-19, after Accenture and IBM.NoneTCS’ Chief Marketing Officer Ravi Viswanathan said, “2018 was a year of celebrations at TCS, marking the completion of five decades of industry-leading customer satisfaction, business performance, and community impact.” He said the last year was characterised by momentum and milestones for the company, including reaching $100 billion in market capitalisation, and securing record-level new customer partnerships in digital services.TCS also emerged a leader in the Japanese market, thanks to “all-round customer experience” and use of artificial intelligence and robotic automatics in its transformation programmes.TCS & Tata: Keeping it splendidIn addition to the IT services list, The ‘Tata’ brand has entered the list of Top 100 most valuable global brands, according to the Brand Finance Global 500, 2019 report released at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Tata is the lone Indian brand in the Top 100. It was rated 104 last year and has climbed to 86 this year. The total value of the Tata brand shot up 37% to $19.5 billion in 2019 from $14.2 billion a year ago. Brand Finance explained that the increase in the valuation of the Tata brand came about after improved performances by key Tata companies like TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel.NoneNoneTCS, in a lot of ways, was one of the companies that put India on the map as an IT hub. It was after all TCS along with similar firms like Infosys which pioneered modern IT outsourcing, by taking over many of the back-office support functions for the Who's Who of global corporations like GM, Citigroup, among others. The models that were built by TCS and its peers have in fact been adopted by much of the rest the world, and have in the process made Silicon Valley teem with Indians. The IT Services industry which today generates about $167 billion annually is now at a crossroads. There is the rise of automation, artificial intelligence, there is cloud computing... all of these trends in the industry are pushing away the rather labour-intensive back office programming operations that TCS specialises in. But analysts also believe that Tata may be in the best position to make that leap from the old ways into the New World, so to speak.NoneNoneNoneNoneAnother thing that also contributed significantly to the success of TCS is the fact that the waters in TCS seem to not be choppy. Founded in 1969, the company is on the cusp of celebrating is golden jubilee year, but take a guess as to how many CEOs it has had. Well, I didn't know this either, but, just four! Since its founding in 1969, all the way up to 1996, the company was under the stewardship of FC Kohli. Then there was S Ramadorai, after whom N Chandrasekaran took over. Chandrasekaran of course went on to be promoted as the Chairman of Tata Sons in 2017. Currently, TCS is helmed by Rajesh Gopinathan.Homegrown successNoneNone"

description,"Juul devices, like most electronic cigarettes, vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush."
content,"US-based electronic cigarette company Juul Labs Inc is hoping to launch its products in India by late 2019, a person familiar with the strategy told Reuters, marking one of its boldest bets to expand away from its home turf.After recruiting Uber India executive Rachit Ranjan as a senior public policy strategist, Juul this month hired India-based Mastercard executive Rohan Mishra as head of government relations.It plans to hire at least three more executives, including an India general manager, LinkedIn job postings showed. It also plans ""a new India subsidiary"", according to one posting.""It (the plan) is currently at an exploratory stage, but the company needs people on the ground in India,"" the source said.Juul's sleek vaping devices, which resemble a USB flash drive and offer flavours such as mango and creme, are a sensation in the United States but have drawn tighter regulatory scrutiny due to surging use among teenagers.Juul devices, like most electronic cigarettes, vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush.Advocates for the devices say that they are far less of a health threat because users don't inhale the dangerous matter taken into the lungs through cigarette smoking.Opponents argue the devices still involve addictive chemicals and can be a gateway to cigarette smoking, especially for the young.The push to launch in India is part of the company's broader Asia strategy. India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China in the world, making it a lucrative market for firms such as Juul and Philip Morris International Inc.However, India's regulatory environment for tobacco and electronic cigarettes is highly restrictive. The health ministry last year advised states to stop the sale or import of e-cigarettes, saying they pose a ""great health risk"". Eight of India's 29 states currently ban e-cigarettes.Juul is studying central and state regulations that could block its plans, the source said, adding that it would engage with the medical community to build acceptance for the devices.Juul said in a statement India was among the Asian markets under evaluation, but there were no ""definitive plans"".""As we explore potential markets, we are engaging with health regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders,"" the company said.MEDICAL JOURNALAs part of its evaluation, Juul said it would consult with the Indian Journal of Clinical Practice (IJCP), a healthcare communications company.One of the journal's editors is a former president of the Indian Medical Association, K.K. Aggarwal, who has publicly voiced his support for e-cigarettes.The IJCP will advise Juul on the regulatory landscape and offer advice on how it should approach the market, a second person familiar with the plans said.Juul would face competition from leading players in India's $10 billion cigarette market - ITC and Godfrey Phillips - which sell such electronic devices as well.India's vapour-products market was valued at only $15.6 million in 2017, according to Euromonitor International, but it is expected to grow by nearly 60 percent a year up to 2022.Juul could be ""potentially very attractive"" to the growing number of young and wealthy smokers in India, said Shane MacGuill, Head of Tobacco Research at Euromonitor International.Altria Group Inc last month paid $12.8 billion to take a 35 percent stake in Juul, a move expected to boost the company's international growth prospects.Philip Morris is also considering a launch of its heat-not-burn tobacco device iQOS in India, which it says is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, Reuters reported last year.Many tobacco-control activists are opposed to e-cigarettes, saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people to consume tobacco. More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses."

There has been speculation that the outlet may be in the Maker Maxity mall in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex.The company was unable to open its own stores in India as its application for single-brand retail has been incomplete for a long time. It applied for the same in 2016, but the proposal was never cleared as the government mandates that companies opting for over 51 percent foreign investment must get nearly a third of their products locally. Therefore, Apple took the route of opening franchisee-operated stories in Indian metros.The management had also asked for exemptions on duties for manufacturing, repair units, components, equipment and consumables for smartphone service and repair for 15 years, but the government did not agree to most of these demands."

content,"India's textiles sector may see higher growth following robust domestic demand and depreciating rupee value, a report said.India Ratings has maintained a stable outlook for the textile sector for 2019-20 following strong domestic demand, waning impact of the disruptions due to GST and demonetisation and rising exports aided by a weak rupee.The textile companies are likely to improve cash-flow from operations for FY20, as their working capital would stabilise as challenges related to demonetisation and the GST subside, Ind-Ra report said.The sector is also likely to continue deleveraging gradually in FY20 in view of strong annual growth generation and some moderation in the debt level.The liquidity of the majority of players in the sector is likely to remain adequate, alongwith an improvement in operational cash generation, backed by steady raw material costs and strong demand from end-user segments, it added.Ind-Ra expects the domestic and global stock-to-use ratios to remain under pressure during cotton year 2018-19.The agency said global cotton production is likely to decline in cotton year 2018-19 owing to a low acreage and adverse weather conditions in key cotton-growing nations.Domestic cotton price moderated to an average rate of Rs 128 per kg during the third quarter of FY19 from the average level of Rs 134 per kg during the second quarter of the current year.While expectations of a high acreage during cotton year 2019-20 narrowing global production gap could keep prices range-bound.China's cotton production continues to be much lower than its consumption. Its cotton deficit was increasingly met through imports over the last three years.With its cotton reserves declining, the sensitivity of global cotton prices to China's cotton policies have increased in the past few quarters. Any decision by China to further increase imports could lead to a rise in global cotton prices.Meanwhile, the India's textile exporters are likely to continue to benefit from improved cost competitiveness due to a weak rupee, which would drive volume growth.Over the first nine-month of FY19, the Indian rupee depreciated at a higher rate against the US dollar than the currencies of key apparel-exporting countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh."

He consumed whatsoever unconsumed food he found in the bins of restaurants. Neither he married. Nor he had a family of his own. Just lived a solitary life. For forty long years, he cycled across his town in Sweden, picked up cans and exchanged them with a recycling plant for money.At the age of 60, when he died of heart attack, many believed that he left behind nothing.

A house garage full of fancy motorbikes. A wardrobe full of branded garments. A Facebook timeline full of vacation pictures. Knowingly or unknowingly, we assume that a life full of materialistic things has to be nothing but wealthy.When I was in my early 20s, I used to see my neighbours living a lavish lifestyle. Driving high-end cars. Wearing stamped clothes from head-to-toe. Holidaying every three months and so. All I believed was that these were the true symbols of being wealthy. That was how rich people lived. Without recognizing the value-eroding nature, I started judging their wealthy status based on the number of depreciating assets they own. But it was further from the truth.Behind their flashy lifestyles, existed countless 100 percent consumed paychecks. Instant pleasurable moments that produced quick results were always preferred to delayed gratifications.NoneAs I grew in age, I began to understand the genuine meaning of wealth. Wealth is the portion of paycheck that we put to work every month. Wealth is the financial or physical asset that we accumulate to achieve financial independence. Wealth is something that pays your own pocket, not your lender. And last but not the least, wealth is not a depreciating asset that we love to flaunt on social media.NoneOne of the most important thoughts in his post that really makes sense is:""Wealth is what you don't see. It's the cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The renovations postponed, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. It's assets in the bank that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see.""Further, he adds:""If you see someone driving a $200,000 car, the only data point you have about their wealth is that they have $200,000 less than they did before they bought the car. Or they're leasing the car, which truly offers no indication of wealth.""This pretty sums up the essence of this post.***I don't endorse the idea of living a life of a stooge. Surely, one must earn and enjoy the present. But this shouldn’t be done at the cost of ditching future goals. Child’s higher education can’t wait. Not even our retirement. But the instant gratifications really can. The moment we spend from our investment account to upgrade our Hatchback to a premium SUV or Crossover, we ensure that our wealth gets reduced by the same amount or even more when realized in terms of future returns.""A key use of wealth is using it to control your time and providing you with options. Financial assets on a balance sheet offer that. But they come at the direct expense of showing people how much wealth you have with material stuff."" - Morgan HouselShun the idea of flaunting fancy stuff. Cars. Jewelry. Frequent night-outs included. Stop competing with the neighbours. Try to imagine what you can't see. Build monetary wealth to buy real wealth – Time. Use it to explore other options beyond your workplace. Pursue something that you love doing the most. And if you can't figure something out, figure out how to figure it out.NoneNone"

description,"The Mumbai-based company would now be spending around Rs 1,100-1,150 crore this year as against its capex guidance of Rs 1,500 crore provided in July"
content,"NoneThe Mumbai-based company would now be spending around Rs 1,100-1,150 crore this year as against its capex guidance of Rs 1,500 crore provided in July. For FY20, it has raised its guidance to Rs 1,500-1,700 crore from Rs 1,200-1,300 crore.“Our current inventories are high because the market did not pick-up at the pace we had anticipated it to. Overall demand has been weak. But demand-supply should match up going forward. That is why I am not particularly negative on growth going forward. March is a strong month it should get better from there,” said Managing Director Anant Goenka.Capex for next year will be used to go on stream, and then ramp-up production at the company’s newest plant in Halol, Gujarat. Ceat will be manufacturing truck and bus radials from this plant. Commercial production of the Halol factory will begin in the next few weeks, company officials stated.Kumar Subbiah, Chief Financial Officer, Ceat said, “The capex for next year will be Rs 1,500-1,700 crore and we will finish the year with about Rs 1,100-1,150 crore, which will be lower than previously planned. We have some flexibility in scheduling our capex. Halol plant has seen an investment of Rs 450 crore, which is 45 percent of allotted capex. The balance would be spread over an 18-month period.”NoneThe same holds true for car and two-wheelers. Ceat is investing about Rs 2,000 crore towards new capacity addition in four manufacturing plants that manufacture passenger car radials. This will increase its capacity to 700,000 tyres per month from 500,000 units at present.The categories of truck and bus radials (TBR) and off-the-road (OTR) tyres will witness a combined investment of Rs 1,500 crore (Rs 1,000 crore for TBR and Rs 500 crore OTR) towards new capacity addition. The Halol facility, which exclusively produces these tyres, has a peak production capacity of 80,000 units per month.“We will start with about 5000 units per month and gradually ramp it up to 80,000 levels. We expect to reach full capacity by December 2020,” said Goenka.NoneCeat posted below-estimate margin for Q3 FY19 due to weak exports, higher raw material costs and slowdown in replacement tyre demand. This segment constitutes nearly 60 percent of the company’s revenue and exports 12 percent."

title,"Living easy, living free: The beast they call NHAI and its debt burden"
datetime,2019-01-30 17:57:00+00:00
description,"'As long as India doesn't reach a point of total and wretched failure, I'd say an investment in NHAI debt is sound,' says Capitalmind's Deepak Shenoy. "
content,"CapitalmindNoneSanjay says this of the road building, government-owned, behemoth:-It has debt of Rs 1,48,000 crore, but doesn't produce any earnings or operating cash flow-So, to service that debt, NHAI has to take on new debt – 83 percent of net cash from financing came from new bond issuances-Governments and banks won’t fund it, so it has to go tap the bond market instead-NHAI ""secures"" the bonds against roads that it doesn’t own (they're owned by the GOI).-So the AAA rating that NHAI gets is not warranted, but it gets more and more debt because it can (and has a AAA rating)-Debt's gone up substantially in the last few years.-This won't end well.In general, that would be true. But this NHAI has always been a special beast. So my view differs, but let’s take this one step at a time.NoneNHAI is a special company.It doesn't even have shares.The government owns 100 percent and keeps adding more and more capital to it.And NHAI was not designed to produce income or operating cash flow.That's right. All that it makes, from toll revenues, goes straight to the Consolidated Fund of India. What it gets is a ""grant"" from the government – basically, the government puts more capital into NHAI.Read that again: What it makes from tolls is not its revenue. In return, it gets more capital from the government.Which creates havoc in traditional accounting statements. If you don’t have operating income, you don't have operating cash flows.It looks like you've taken on debt that can only be paid if the government is benevolent enough to add more capital every year.But that's how the government does it – it just adds capital, and that’s how it’s all balanced.Take a look at the recent result declaration (September 18):NoneEssentially its losses of around Rs 173 crore are more than covered by the increase in equity, in six months, from Rs 1,63,000 crore to Rs 1,81,000 crore (an addition of Rs 18,000 crore).The Debt to Equity ratio is still 0.82 – which is higher than earlier, but still quite reasonable.So how does NHAI make any money?We have FY17 annual report only – and in that, the total debt was about Rs 75,000 crore. For which, their interest costs have been roughly 7 percent to 8 percent. Considering the upper level, that would mean an interest cost of Rs 6,000 crore.Note: About Rs 13,000 crore of this debt was at 6 percent (Capital Gains bonds).In response to an audit query, it states that NHAI is ""an executive agency of the Government of India, and does not have any income"". But they do make money: Tolls. How much?They got about Rs 7,000 crore in tolls in FY17.NoneApart from that, they got Rs 2,326 crore from cess collected (part of the income tax collections is a road cess).They did raise Rs 32,000 crore additionally from taxable bonds and capital gains bonds (and redeemed some) but it's clear that the interest payment on these bonds was more than covered by the tolls received (Rs 7,000 crore).There’s also an additional Rs 8,000 crore (cess plus development funding) that was added by the government.You would ask then:How can NHAI pay back principal? It has to keep rolling over the bonds!For one, this is not an independent profit making company, so it should be treated like the government. And the government debt works like that – while they build things, they will have to rollover debt. It's only much later that the principal can reduce because of better collections (all governments work like this, worldwide).Yes, you can say all governments are Ponzi schemes. They need more debt to pay back current debt. That's how it is. And if you don't pay them your taxes, they'll put you in jail. So they are extortionists too. But no one calls them that because it's okay, apparently. It is possible to be outraged, but there's a lot more peace when you know it’s all subjective and gray.Consider this – that tolls go up 5 percent a year and debt and all activity is frozen in time right now. Assume the government pays for any road maintenance and operational costs. Even with Rs 1,50,000 crore debt at 8 percent, we're speaking of a cost of Rs 12,000 crore today, which the toll collections and user cess taxes cover.If you freeze it in time right now, and tolls rise 5 percent a year, you have 17 years at which the entity becomes debt free.NoneIn the infra space, a 17-20 year gestation is not a big deal, and if interest rates fall (8 percent rates at 5 percent, inflation doesn't last too long) we should see the time period reduce further.But Rs 1,50,000 crore debt should be on the government books!Yes, because this is borrowing that is quasi-guaranteed by the government. But it's not huge. The total borrowing of the central government in FY17 was about Rs 61 lakh crore. Of that, the Rs 75,000 crore is around 1.2 percent more.Even if you consider Rs 1,50,000 crore of debt, then the public debt of the central government is probably about Rs 68 lakh crore – again, roughly 2 percent.This is a ""shadow"" loan of the government, and there is an implicit guarantee of the government on NHAI loans. The 2 percent could be troublesome, but it's not so big that it causes serious worry (bigger concerns are FCI, pensions and PSU banks).And the government is sovereign, so NHAI is AAA. Debt investors don't care about investors making profits. They care about the intent to return money, which the market seems confident about.Why has the debt gone up?We've had a massive expansion in road programs in the last few years. The eventual plan is to have some Rs 4,00,000 crore here.The second reason is the shift of program types. Earlier, road projects were PPP, public-private-partnerships, where the government only provided the land and rights to the land, and private operators borrowed to build and operate the road, collect the toll, etc. The government didn't have to pay anything. That didn't work out well – when traffic estimates weren’t met, these projects took big losses which eventually fell on the banks (and thus on the government).Now, they do HAM (Hybrid Annuity Model) projects and EPC (think of this as plain contracting). Meaning private operators get paid to build the road – in HAM it's over 20 years, and in EPC it's relatively shorter. The earlier BOT type projects needed the NHAI to need no money upfront – but in HAM and EPC, NHAI has to pay. So debt goes up faster than earlier.Will this end well?I do not support giving governments endless amounts of money. But one thing that is surely the responsibility of the government is: roads.What NHAI does is build roads – and pretty good ones, going by my recent trip to Goa (I love the drive). These things last, and help long-term economic activity. You don't reap rewards today. You won't even reap them inside of NHAI – perhaps at some point, we only build no-toll roads. But the economic impact is massive in the long term, from easier access to local commerce to truck efficiency and so on. The costs are borne by the government, whose goal is to serve people with the tax they collect – and the benefits go to the people (and also to the government as tax).As long as India doesn't reach a point of total and wretched failure, I'd say an investment in NHAI debt is sound. Even if the books of NHAI need to be fixed – lots of horrible errors there for sure – and even if they need funding each year. Just never buy their equity as a shareholder.The good old AC/DC song (""Highway to Hell"") starts with lyrics that probably belong on NHAI's accounting statements:Taking everything in my strideThe author is Founder and CEO of Capitalmind. "

title,Indian fans go premium as buyers want an edge
datetime,2019-01-28 20:55:00+00:00
description,Technology-led fans are now hitting the Indian markets and customers are willing to pay the extra price
content,"Indian customers no longer want ordinary fans at homes. As all other appliances become ‘smarter’ with a clear focus on premiumisation, customers are aspirational and fan-makers do not want to be left out. With a cost range of Rs 2,500 to as high as Rs 40,000, consumer durables firms want to ensure the premium category caters to customers across income groups.NoneIn January 2019, Orient Electric launched a premium ceiling fan which the company said was the world’s slimmest smart fan.NoneAtul Jain, Senior Vice President & Business Head (fans), Orient Electric said the company has more than 40 percent market share in premium fans and hopes to gain further dominance in the segment. Aspirational customers look for smarter purchases and their new product is expected to create interest among such buyers, he said.NoneIndian buyers want household appliances to not only serve the basic purpose but also add to the décor of the house. Appliance makers have acknowledged the need and are launching relevant products.According to a new report by Emkay Global Financial Services companies are now focusing on increasing the contribution of premium and decorative fans, as the category is largely penetrated well and incremental replacement demand could drive premiumisation.NoneGraphics by Ritesh PresswalaDealers said customers who are buying a second fan for the house usually go for premium models. “For households where individuals cannot afford an air-conditioner, getting a second fan is an option. Here, the key is to go for models that have a much more powerful motor and are also energy efficient even if they come in at 30-40 percent premium,” said the head of the western market at an electronics retailer.Emkay Research also showed, given the highest penetration, the category will see the highest proportion of replacement demand. Fans should also record the highest premiumisation-linked demand, the report stated.Customers are also slowly getting more aware of the advantages of getting energy-efficient appliances.Manoj Meena, Co-founder & CEO, Atomberg Technologies (manufacturer of Gorilla brand of fans) said unlike traditional fans, their products are equipped with an energy-efficient motor that helps every household save up to Rs 2,000 per year on each fan.The fan market in India today is worth Rs 10,000 crore. The organised market would be close to Rs 7,500 crores and is expected to record compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 percent over the next five years. Havells is the leader in the premium fans category, as per the Emkay report.As of today, the market for premium fans (Selling price of Rs 2,500 and above) is Rs 1,500 crores. Meena said this segment of the market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 25 percent over the next five years.How are premium fans different?Compared to a regular fan that has a manual regulator, the new-age premium fans not only have remote-controlled speeds but also an LED underlight so that the product can have multi-functional uses.Take Orient Electric’s Aeroslim fan. The company said it is enabled with Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology that enables users to manage fan speed and modes, reverse rotation and underlight with dimming options via a mobile application.Similarly, Atomberg’s Gorilla fans not only have the feature of remote-control but also a sleep mode and timer mode that can be pre-set.Havells, which is one of the largest players in this segment is launching a new range of fans for summer 2019. Among these, is an IoT-based smart fan that can be controlled with a remote, mobile app and Wi‐Fi connectivity, the fan would adjust its speed based on temperature and humidity in the room. The fan would also come with auto-function modes like sleep and breeze.Way forwardIn the fans segment, Emkay Research stated the organised players control 75 percent and of that four to five players have ~85 percent market share. The majority of the fans demand is met through domestic production.“Focus on improving product mix will also lead to margin accretion. Incremental competitive intensity in the premium and ultra-premium category is expected to increase from new players as well. As per our dealer checks, LG is launching a range of premium fans (price point >Rs 4,000) with latest technologies."

content,"Fan-maker Atomberg Technologies is now looking to expand its product presence in the white goods space. In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Manoj Meena, Co-Founder & CEO, Atomberg Technologies said they are looking to make entry either into the air-cooler or mixer-grinder segment in January 2020.“We have prototypes made at our research and development unit. We are looking at entering air-coolers and mixer-grinder space and would launch products in one of these categories in January next year,” he added.The company was founded in April 2012 by two IIT Bombay alumni.The company sells energy-efficiency fans under the ‘Gorilla’ brand. These are premium fans priced at Rs 3,000 for the pedestal fans category and Rs 4,000 and above for the ceiling fan category. Meena said they believe there is no place in the market for appliances that consume unnecessary electricity.“Our products offer same air delivery at lesser power consumption. Due to this, customers are able to save on their electricity bills,” he added. The company wants to hold a 10 percent market share in the premium fans space.Atomberg is also coming with a range of new fans in March 2019 that will enable connectivity with smart home devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Meena added their new smart fans will be Wi-Fi enabled and can connect to smartphones as well.The company has also a large presence in the business-to-business segment and Meena said one of the key achievements has been tying up with players like Tata Power. He added, there will be an equal focus on both retail and corporate clients."

title,Amazon sales outlook falls short after record holiday quarter
datetime,2019-02-01 08:42:00+00:00
description,"Shares of the company fell 5 percent to $1,635 after the bell."
content,"Amazon.com Inc on January 31 forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, warning that new regulations in India had created uncertainty around one of its key growth markets and saying it would step up investments in 2019.Shares of the company fell 5 percent to $1,635 after the bell.The outlook overshadowed Amazon's record sales and profit during the holiday season. Fast and free shipping helped the world's largest online retailer boost revenue by 20 percent. A lucrative cloud computing business, as well as fees that merchants pay Amazon to ship and advertise their products, has fattened the company's once-thin profit margin.Net income jumped 63 percent to $3 billion for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts' estimates.Yet investors focused their attention on Amazon's international operation, where the company has long lost money in the hopes of future profit. Though its international operating loss shrunk to $642 million in the quarter from $919 million a year earlier, new regulations in India are poised to take a toll. The rules seek to protect local businesses by prohibiting foreign e-commerce companies from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest.Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters that the ""situation in India is a bit fluid right now.""The company began removing a wide array of products from its India website late on Thursday to comply with the new foreign investment curbs that kick in on Feb. 1, Reuters reported.Still, Olsavsky said, ""India remains a good long-term opportunity.""Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird Equity Research, said, ""The issues in India are taking a toll on the Q1 outlook, even as growth overall slows domestically. Not a bad report, but there are enough questions where (the) stock will likely be under pressure.""HIGHER SPENDINGThe company forecast net sales of between $56 billion and $60 billion for the first quarter, missing analysts' average estimate of $60.77 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The guidance includes two percentage points of negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates.Olsavsky said that investments would increase this year. The company had little need to splurge in 2018 thanks to prior spending on warehouses, headcount and other areas, boosting profit. But this year investments will rise, though Olsavsky did not detail where or how much.""As a result, the profit story in 19 may not be as good as it was in 18,"" said Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson, adding that this might not be a bad thing.""If they are stepping on the accelerator, that means they like what they are seeing, and it's worthy of more investment,"" he said.Amazon forecast operating income will be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion this quarter, compared with $1.9 billion a year earlier.A large chunk of the company's hiring has gone to Amazon Web Services, its lucrative business selling data storage and computing power in the cloud. Revenue for the unit surged 45.3 percent to $7.43 billion, beating an average estimate of $7.26 billion.Overall, net sales for the fourth quarter were $72.38 billion and beat analysts' average estimate of $71.87 billion on the back of a strong holiday season, which includes the major U.S. shopping event Black Friday.The results demonstrate that Amazon continued its ""relentless assault"" on other retailers over Christmas, Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.Amazon said tens of millions of shoppers signed up for its loyalty club Prime during the season - more than in any prior quarter - helping boost revenue from subscription fees 25 percent to $4.0 billion. The company said last year it has more than 100 million Prime members globally.This expansive customer base has lured merchants to sell goods on the company's marketplace, to the point where more than half of products sold on Amazon come from third-parties.Making Amazon more profitable still are ad sales. The company now ranks alongside Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc as titans in marketing, letting these same merchants pay for high placement in Amazon's search results."

The report collected evidence from victims, witnesses and established the causes, how the events unfolded and exposed the alleged perpetrators of the riots.Since then, Justice Srikrishna has headed several high-profile commissions such as the Sixth Pay Commission, that led to a significant raise in salaries of government employees, and the Committee for Consultations on the Situation in Andhra Pradesh (CCSAP). This was a committee that gave an authoritative account on the social, economic and historic dimensions of the demand for the state of Telangana and the feasibility of its formation. He recently led a committee that submitted its report on the issues related to data protection.Justice Srikrishna is considered to be apolitical, as his services have been sought by governments across multiple political dispensations. He is known to maintain a calm demeanor and loathe publicity, despite heading committees that are under extreme media scrutiny.A polyglot who can speak over 10 languages, he can quote from both the Bhagawad Gita and Shakespeare with ease. Justice Srikrishna speaks less, listens intensely and cuts through the noise to absorb the crux of the matter."

While for the quarter the company sold 227,000 units of Pulsar and Avenger the Neon series is expected to boost demand in the coming weeks.“Pulsar Neon series has unlocked a lot of demand. Volumes have gone up significantly after the introduction of Neon. We will probably close this month at 20 percent growth in retail demand. Platina 110 has become the lead with 25,000-30,000 units this month. Classic Pulsar 150 is doing 25,000 units a month,” added D’sa."

content,"Leaders of Indian National Congress’ Kerala unit have called for a meeting with its allies after two partners — the Indian Union Muslim League and Kerala Congress (M) — sought extra seats to contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.Congress and other leaders of the United Democratic Front (UDF) will meet in capital Thiruvananthapuram on January 31.On January 29, IUML and KC (M) staked claim to contest on extra seats during their meeting with Congress President Rahul Gandhi, according to reports.However, the seat-sharing formula was not discussed.In 2014, the IUML had contested from Malappuram and Ponnani. It had won both seats. KC (M) represents the Kottayam seat — the only seat it contested then.The demand for more seats has reportedly created confusion in the Congress as it has not started discussions with its leaders and cadre yet.Most opinion polls have given UDF the advantage over the Left. In a state that has voted the local government out every five years, Congress-led UDF is banking on local anti-incumbency to grab a large chunk of Lok Sabha seats.In Kerala, the UDF’s main rival is the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not have significant presence in the state, its support base has swelled over the last few years.NoneKerala has a total of 20 parliamentary seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress won eight seats, followed by IUML’s two. KC (M) and the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) won one each. The UDF won a total of 12 seats."

description,Last year few years of gains have resulted in build-up of complacency and leverage by retail investors. Unraveling of those can mean further downsides in the market
content,"NoneWhat goes up has to come down, said Isaac Newton, in reference to gravity. Stock prices move in cycles with the upside celebrated as coming of age for the markets and the downside fretted upon as an act of lunacy.When we talk about markets, one generally refers to the broader indices that are seen as the bell-weather measure on how the market is performing. In years when the broader markets are higher, stocks generally perform better and vice-versa.Going by that logic, 2018 was a whole different ball game altogether. Sensex and Nifty both ended the year in positive, portfolios of most investors, not quite! Market internals broke like no other time though with a majority of the stocks ending sharply lower.NoneRelative market capitalizationFor this, we will take the market cap of stocks at the beginning of 2017 and see how they fared in 2017 and later in 2018.None2017 was a fantastic year and regardless of what market-cap you started at, almost 85 percent of companies saw their price close higher. 2018 saw role reversal for all companies where they had a market cap below Rs 2.5 lakh crore.The reason for the large-cap index to show gains in 2018 came from this small minority of companies which command a very high weight in the index.Positive momentum vs negative momentumIn bull markets, most of the stocks are either in buy zones or with positive momentum. In bear markets, we see the inverse with most of stocks showing negative momentum. We define positive momentum as a stock whose price movement indicates a Sharpe ratio of greater than one, over a one-year period (meaning, the increase in price of a stock is relatively higher than the volatility it has seen over a one-year period).We plot this as a percentage of the total stock universe.NoneNoneNoneLast year few years of gains have resulted in build-up of complacency and leverage by retail investors. Unraveling of those can mean further downsides in the market – stocks with negative momentum can become even more negative.The indicator here tells us that:-As a market, we are very heavily negative on breadth. There are way more stocks with price damage than there are that are seeing appreciating prices-This has happened before, but about seven years ago, and subsequent year returns have been quite good (at least visually). However we could easily go further down from here-The last time (2011) that we saw such negative momentum, the broad index was also down 25 percent from the peak. This time, the Nifty is only down 10 percent from the peak, but the broader indices are hurt much more.-Still, it doesn't mean that now is the best time to buy. It just means the risk-reward is in your favour, if you’re a longer-term investor, and you’re building portfolios at this time.The author is Head of Compliance at Capitalmind."

title,Linde India delisting – value premium or greed?
datetime,2019-01-31 16:57:00+00:00
description,According to SEBI guidelines BOC can't offer to delist for another six months.
content,"NoneNoneLinde India has 5,260 tpd air separation unit (ASU) built for Tata's steel plant and another 2,220 tpd ASU for Jindal Steels. Linde Group was recently acquired by Praxair and in India, Praxair had planned to delist their India business from the exchanges.Linde India was earlier owned by BOC UK Plc. In 2006, Linde AG (Germany) took over BOC in a GBP 8.2 billion takeover. BOC at that time was much larger in size than Linde. Prior to that, Linde AG had made some failed attempt to takeover BOC. Linde and BOC have a history of working together for more than 130 years.After the takeover, until 2013, Linde India was known as BOC India. As part of a global rebranding process, BOC India was rechristened as Linde India, but currently has BOC as its promoter with 75 percent stake.Linde India and Praxair mergerPraxair and Linde group last year initiated a merger process after an approval from the US federal trade commission and European Commission. The market cap of the combined entities is believed to be at $90 billion and combined revenue at $27 billion (considering 2017 revenue). Linde India being a subsidiary of Linde group was also absorbed in the merger.The global merger concluded in the last week of October 2018.Praxair and Linde have working relations for many decades and have been pitched against each other in some verticals.As part of a new strategy by Praxair, the management wanted to take Linde India private by delisting it from stock exchanges.How delisting worksThe BOC group which is the majority stakeholder in Linde India will take the full ownership. The earlier process of delisting was to put an open offer for the public shareholders. The open offer would be usually above the current market price (premium), to lure public shareholders to tender their shares. If the promoters were unable to buyback all intended shares in the first offer then they make a second open offer at a higher price. The process would be repeated until 90 percent of the public shareholders tendered the shares making it time-consuming and yet not ensuring a full buyback.SEBI issued new guidelines for voluntary delisting to streamline the delisting process. In the new process, promoters will engage in reverse book building to determine the price they need to pay for all the remaining shareholders if they intend to take the company private. Here is how the delisting process works;Assume a promoter has 75 percent stake in the firm to be delisted and the total shares outstanding is one crore. Promoters need to acquire 25 percent (25 lakh shares) to complete the delisting.- For the promoters to finalise the offer price (discovery price), they should be able to acquire a minimum of 90 percent of outstanding shares. (Image source: Capitalmind)- If promoters are ready to buy the shares at Rs 600, then they can process the buyback of shares and go ahead with delisting.In earlier cases, investors were given an open offer at a fixed price, which was determined by promoter itself. This meant smaller retail investors didn’t have much of a say. The new process brings in the price discovery mechanism, which will ensure a fair price for the shareholders.The case of Linde IndiaDue to the takeover, BOC is by law required to provide an open offer for a minimum 26 percent stake. Given that only 25 percent of the current shareholding is with the public, BOC instead went ahead with a voluntary delisting offer.As part of the process, BOC opened the bidding on January 15, 2019, at a floor price of Rs 428.50. The bidding concluded a couple of days back. The price discovered during reverse bidding was at Rs 2,025.The promoter rejected the price and is unwilling to buyback at Rs 2,025. The discovered price is nearly 4.7 times higher than floor price offered. The stock cratered the day the information on the price became public as there were doubts if the company will be willing to buy back shares at such a high price.Today, the company decided against following up on desisting and instead is persisting with its buyback. According to SEBI guidelines, BOC can't offer to delist for another six months.Reliance Mutual Fund – The deal breaker Reliance Capital Trustee through Reliance Multi Cap Fund and Reliance Tax Saver (ELSS) Fund is a major stake owner in terms of public shareholders. Reliance funds own around 9.85 percent of the total stake. For promoters to reach 90 percent of threshold, Reliance funds' bid plays a major role. In the reverse bidding process, Reliance placed its bid above Rs 2,000, taking the final offer price (or discovery price ) to Rs 2,025.For a stock that was traded at Rs 400 levels just a few months back, Rs 2,025 is a price that is unlikely to be seen for a very long period of time. This isn’t the first instance of minority shareholders asking for a price that is way above current market price. In 2012, Alfa Laval went for delisting with floor price set at Rs 2,850. The discovered price was Rs 3,000 but not many shareholders participated in the offer. The offer was then raised to Rs 4,000 and the stock was delisted from exchanges.Another stock that comes to mind where a major stockholder tried to push the company to offer a much higher price than the one it was willing to offer was Blue Dart.Promoters of Blue Dart wanted to delist in 2011. Radhakishan Damani held a 5.5 percent stake and asked for a price of Rs 2,300 for his stake which was well above the market price which were trading at around Rs 1,400. DHL did not proceed with the delisting and over time has reduced its holding to 75 percent to comply with SEBI norms.The stock performance in the subsequent years showed that Damani was right in asking for that price with the stock peaking in 2015 at Rs 7,850, nearly three times Damani's own asking price.The Road AheadAs part of SEBI regulations on open offer, promoters will do an open offer for the price Linde India was acquired for by Praxair. The open offer is at Rs 328.21 which can be enhanced by 10 percent according to SEBI guidelines. The open offer will close on April 11, 2019.Considering the stock is currently trading at Rs 560 a piece and floor piece was pegged at Rs 428.50, it's doubtful to see it being successful in which case, Linde will continue to be listed for the forthcoming future. As for the unitholders of Reliance MF holding those shares, only time will tell if the decision of the fund manager to ask for such a high price was worthwhile given the stock’s own history.The author is a market analyst with Capitalmind.in."

description,Did Bill Gates really save Apple Computers out of the goodness of his heart?
content,"In August 1997, Steve Jobs made a significant announcement that would alter the course of Apple’s future. He announced a partnership with Apple’s biggest rival at the time, Microsoft. To save Apple, then known as Apple Computer from bankruptcy, Bill Gates bought $150 million of non-voting shares in Apple Computer and offered Apple free-access to use Microsoft Office, which at the time was the primary software computer users demanded, on Mac PCs. This historic move saved Apple from bankruptcy. But why did Gates do it?The Cut-throat BusinessmanToday, people around the world know Bill Gates for his generosity and philanthropy, but back in the 1990s things were different, Gates had a reputation of a being a non-apologetic, cut-throat businessman willing to anything to succeed in the industry. And his approach worked; Microsoft at the time had grown so successful that it attracted the attention of Antitrust Regulators from the American Department of Justice (DOJ).An Imminent ThreatThe DOJ had been preparing a long, drawn-out case against Microsoft since 1993. In 1998, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating the Sherman Act, a law that regulated the ability of conglomerates to assemble monopolies and stifle competition. The DOJ alleged that Microsoft had abused its monopoly on Intel PCs in its handling of operating system and web browser sales. The main issue of the case was whether Microsoft could bundle Internet Explorer web browser with its Windows OS.A Monopolistic ApproachYou have to understand, at the time web browsers weren’t freeware. And browsers like Netscape, Navigator or Opera had to be downloaded off the internet or purchased at a store. However, Microsoft’s planned to bundle their Internet Explorer web browser with the Windows OS, which would mean every Windows user would have Internet Explorer, eliminating the need to go out and purchase a new browser. This move would give Microsoft absolute monopoly as the Windows operating system made up for approximately 90% of total market share.A Microsoft VictoryBill Gates didn’t want his company broken up by a long-drawn-out court battle. So what better way to show Microsoft isn’t a monopoly than by supporting the competition. During the DOJ deposition, Gates remained as vague as possible with his replies; Bill was aware that by saving the competition (Apple) a year earlier, Microsoft couldn’t be deemed as a monopoly. Three years later, the DOJ dropped the case and cleared Microsoft with minimal punishments.NoneThe Mystery of the Shares"

title,Decoded: Why Modi govt chose tax rebate over exemption in Budget 2019
datetime,2019-02-01 19:27:00+00:00
description,It's not just about saving money.
content,"Khyati DharamsiFinance Minister Piyush Goyal pulled off a blockbuster Interim Budget from which not much was expected to begin with. The headline announcement was that the government would now offer a full tax rebate on taxable income up to Rs 5 lakh.This is different from saying that those earning up to Rs 5 lakh are exempt from tax. So individuals whose income falling between Rs 2.5 lakh-Rs 5 lakh will still technically be taxed at the regular rate of 5 percent, but the amount will be refunded as a rebate while filing tax returns.Why go for a rebate rather than straight exemption?The first, obvious, reason is the government saves money and only the low- and middle-income individual gets the benefit.""This helps the government offer the benefit only to the low-income earners, without sacrificing on the tax from the high earners in the Rs 10 lakh to 10 crore range,” says Ameet Patel, Partner at Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.“The rich will still pay the tax as per their tax slabs,” says Prakash Shah, a Mumbai-based chartered accountant.However, there's a second reason as well.“The government wants to keep the tax net intact even as they extend the tax benefit to the low-income earners,"" says Patel. ""If the threshold had been increased, people who earn an income below the threshold would not need to file tax returns.""Data by the Income Tax Department shows about 4.28 crore individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh filed return for Assessment Year 2018-19 (income earned in financial year 2017-18).None“The law states that anyone who is earning an income above the threshold, which is Rs 2.5 lakh currently, needs to file a return of income,"" Paras Savla, Partner at KPB & Associates, says. ""So, the Income Tax Department wants to still keep a watch on people who are earning an income below Rs 5 lakh. Hence, the tax benefit has been offered as a rebate.""The Modi government has made an explicit target to increase the number of tax filers in the country. In the Budget speech, Goyal pointed out that the number of returns filed has increased from 3.79 crore to 6.85 crore -- a growth of 80% growth -- since 2014.The government also encourages timely filing of returns while late returns and non-filing are penalized heavily.None“There have been notices issued to a lot of taxpayers during the past few months, without paying taxes filed returns, regarding non-payment of taxes and implications in terms of prosecution,” notes Savla.“Those earning an income of more than Rs 2.5 lakh, who have not filed a return, need to pay Rs 5,000 (Rs 1,000 if income below Rs 5 lakh) penalty until December 31 of the Assessment Year. The penalty increases to Rs 10,000 if not filed until March 31 of the Assessment Year. If one is caught evading taxes, then 3 times the amount of tax evaded is charged as penalty,” says Sudhir Kaushik, co-founder of TaxSpanner.com."

description,"The rebate under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, has been enhanced to Rs 12,500 from Rs 2,500 earlier"
content,"In a move to give relief to the middle class, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal announced in the Budget 2019 that individual taxpayers will get a full tax rebate for income earned up to Rs 5 lakh.Previously, the income threshold on which rebate was given was Rs 3.5 lakh. Individuals will now get a benefit of Rs 12,500, up from Rs 2,500 earlier. This will benefit taxpayers only to the extent of an annual income of Rs 5 lakh. The basic exemption limit and tax-slabs remain the same.NoneNoneTo be sure, this is a rebate for those whose taxable incomes are up to Rs 5 lakh. The basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh - that is, no tax to be paid for those who earn an income of up to Rs 2.5 lakh - continues.All the tax slabs also continue. In other words, if your taxable income is higher than Rs 5 lakh, you still pay tax at the existing income tax slabs.But did you know that you can still get a salary of up to Rs 10 lakh and still get the benefit of this rebate? Here's how.NoneIn the above example, existing deductions under Income Tax Act under section 80C along with contribution to NPS (Section 80CCD1B), interest paid on home loan (Section 24) and health insurance premium paid (Section 80D; for both yourself and your senior citizen parents) has helped the individual to bring down his taxable income to Rs 5 lakh, according to Mrin Agarwal, founder of Finsafe.This will ensure that his income tax liability is reduced to zero if he files his income tax returns."

title,Budget 2019: Finance Minister raises TDS threshold on bank fixed deposit interest to Rs 40000
datetime,2019-02-01 16:27:00+00:00
description,This will reduce the administrative hassles of the bank fixed deposit investors.
content,"NoneThe earlier limit was set almost couple of decades ago and needed to be revised taking into account inflationary pressures and also the fact that tax slabs and income levels of the individual had changed over a period of time. This raise is seen as a much needed correction.This will reduce the administrative hassles of the bank fixed deposit investors. As per the extant rules, if the interest earned on bank fixed deposits exceeds Rs 10000 in a financial year, then the bank is supposed to collect TDS at the rate of 10 per cent and remit it to central government. However, this does not end the tax liability of the individual.The bank fixed deposit holder is expected to assess his tax liability taking into account his income tax slab rate and pay additional tax wherever applicable. If the bank fixed deposit holder does not have taxable income, he can declare so by submitting Form 15G or Form15H applicable. For example an individual with total income of less than Rs 2.5 lakh in a financial year can submit Form 15G clearly stating his income and the interest received to avoid the TDS."

description,The budget speech mainly reflected on the key achievements of the present government over the past five years and their vision for India.
content,"Swarup MohantyJust a few months remain before the term of the current NDA government ends as Piyush Goyal, the Interim Finance Minister, presented the Interim Budget today. An outgoing government presents only an Interim Budget or seeks a vote on account. The government seeks the Parliament’s nod for incurring expenditure for part of a fiscal year. It leaves it to the next government to present the full budget. Hence, the market expectations were already muted for this Budget.The Budget speech mainly reflected on the key achievements of the present government over the past five years and their vision for India. It can be assumed that the government refrained from announcing big-ticket changes in this Budget. The budget maintained a good balance between populism and fiscal prudence (this was expected being an election budget). The government missed its FY19 fiscal deficit target (of 3.3 percent of GDP) and instead pegged it at 3.4 percent. It budgeted the FY20 fiscal deficit target at 3.4 percent of GDP, missing the glide path target of 3.1 percent. The Budget poses tough challenge for the fiscal situation for FY20 given the aggressive assumptions for tax revenue growth; it however, is expected to boost consumption. This growth mix may prove to be neutral for the overall macro situation.Market had expected, considering the elections, that the government might overshoot the fiscal deficit by 20-30 bps. However the government net borrowing of Rs 4.73 lakh crore in 2019/20 and gross market borrowing of Rs 7.1 lakh crore INR were higher than expected. Debt market reacted slightly negatively with yields spiking by 8-10 bps on 10 year G-Sec. The cumulative effect of the cash transfer to the farmers and the middle income class will be a boost to consumption, but at the likely cost of crowding out private investments.Given the impending elections and the political narrative of farm distress, a special package aimed at farmers was largely expected from the Budget. It primarily focused on a direct cash transfer to farmers (land holdings of up to 2 hectares) of Rs 6,000 annually, costing Rs 75,000 crore (0.36 percent of GDP) in FY20, and a partial Rs 20,000 crore (0.1 percent of GDP) in FY19. The government also announced a 5 percent interest rate subvention on the timely repayment of loans by farmers (pursuing animal husbandry and fisheries).The other focus of the budget was on increasing disposable income in the hands of the middle class, and initiatives like tax rebate for individuals earning up to Rs 5 lakh (3 crore beneficiaries as per government estimates), higher standard deduction for salary income from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000, no TDS on interest earned up to Rs 40,000 per annual from savings bank account and post office savings schemes. Individuals having unoccupied second house will not be required to pay tax on such a property.There were no changes in the capital gains tax structure. There were no change for mutual funds or any other investments as expected too. On the whole it can be inferred that the budget was a non-event from the equity and debt market perspective. Equity markets will now start focusing on the ongoing result season for further direction."

content,"The Pulsar 220F has undisputedly claimed its spot in the hearts of Indian youth for more than a decade now. When Bajaj launched the Pulsar 220 DTS-Fi, it revolutionised the Indian biking scene, such that it is held as a reference point to this day. With the 2019 iteration getting a much-needed ABS upgrade, Bajaj has joined the line of bike manufacturers wanting to make their motorcycles safer on the roads.The Pulsar 220F is a bike which needs no introduction. Right from its get-go to its modern-day avatar, the 220F has stood out of the crowd, only because of its unique design and out-of-the-box concept. The idea of a semi-faired motorcycle, with the agility of a naked, the performance of a supersport and the mileage of a scooter, the 220F made a clear statement about its intentions to rule the Indian markets, which it has been doing since.When Bajaj originally came up with the design for 220F, they intended it to be something quite unlike what roamed the roads in those days. Hence, instead of coming up with a new design using existing components, they decided to make their own Frankenstein’s monster, by combining some of the most advanced technologies at the time. Sporting a fuel injector, oil cooling, digital dash, rear disc brake and clip-on handlebars, the 220F was a fully functional and potent sports bike, in an age when people didn’t know the definition of a sports bike."

Kia SUVs are considered to be a luxury in many countries, and it would not be wrong on Kia’s part to continue the same image in India with the Tusker.Engine refinement Falling in the crossover SUV segment as its cousin the Hyundai Creta, the SP Concept based SUV is expected to be offered with a 1.5-litre diesel and a 1.5-litre petrol. It is also likely to support hybrid powertrain components, which has been making big news throughout the year. The diesel engine is expected to produce 115 PS of power and 250 Nm of torque.Manoeuvrability Hyundai, known for its light steering feedback and massive body roll is not an ideal contender when it comes to comparing handling abilities.  But with Kia stepping into the Indian market, we could expect a sharper, more in-control feel for the driver. Known for making sturdy, durable frames, the Kia line of cars could fare better regarding handling and manoeuvrability.Styling Sitting on a Creta derived platform the Tusker is expected to be a sub-4-metre Compact SUV, which could comfortably seat 6-7 people. Adding to it is Kia’s signature front grille, which instantly distinguishes it from the rest. However, the oversized wheels and the large contoured bumpers have been toned down to better suit Indian taste.Price "

title,Kisan scheme more a sentiment booster than a demand driver for tractors: M&M’s Pawan Goenka
datetime,2019-02-01 18:58:00+00:00
description,"The scheme, however, will likely uplift farmer sentiment, which has been subdued since the past few months"
content,"NoneThe scheme, however, will likely uplift farmer sentiments, which has been subdued since the past few months, its Managing Director Pawan Goenka said.“The PM Kisan scheme does not directly affect sale of agricultural equipment for farmers having under two hectares of land. This is simply because these are not farmers who buy agri-equipments. But for these farmers, Rs 6,000 is about 8-10 percent of their annual income, so it does make a difference for them,” Goenka said.The Rs 6,000 a year, which will be paid in three equal instalments directly by the government, is aimed to take care of farm-related expenses such as buying of seeds, agri-equipments and other such expenses.“This money will probably go into buying more or better agri inputs. Or, can go towards buying some necessities. So, overall sentiments will improve and have a positive psychological impact, especially now that farm sentiments are somewhat subdued,” he added.Data for 2015-16 Agriculture Census reveals that in a total of 146 million operational land holdings in the country, the highest number of operational holders belonged to Uttar Pradesh (23.82 million) followed by Bihar (16.41 million), Maharashtra (14.71 million), Madhya Pradesh (10.00 million), and Karnataka (8.68 million).The average size of operational holding has declined to 1.08 hectares in 2015-16 as compared to 1.15 hectares in 2010-11.“This income support will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of beneficiary farmers. This programme will be funded entirely by the government. About 12 crore farmer families will stand to get benefit from this scheme, which will be brought into effect from December 1, 2018 itself. The first instalment of Rs 2,000 will be paid in a short while. The government will absorb Rs 75,000 crore burden,” Finance Minister Piyush Goyal said."

description,In January two of India’s top four two-wheeler makers sought relief in the form of moving two-wheelers to the 18% GST slab from 28% slab
content,"Finance Minister Piyush Goyal provided no relief on goods and services tax (GST) to automobile companies, disappointing two-wheeler companies categorised under the luxury and sin goods segment.In January, two of India’s top four two-wheeler makers sought relief from the government to move two-wheelers to the 18 percent GST slab from 28 percent.NoneTheir comments were based on the fear of an expected slowdown in demand for motorcycle and scooters in the coming months with the implementation of new regulations and upgradation of vehicle technology as prices will shoot up substantially.Two-wheelers are taxed in the same bracket (labelled as luxury and sin goods segment by the government) as mini cars, even though the consumer base is significantly larger with sales of more than 21 million units a year.The Hero MotoCorp chairman argued the cost-sensitive buyer depends on the two-wheeler as a lifeline and a sharp increase in the prices of two-wheelers following the new set of safety and emission regulations will be detrimental to the industry.“With new safety norms and BS-VI integration also around the corner, both of which will increase two-wheeler prices, it has become imperative to relook at the GST rates for two-wheelers to ensure social inclusion that is sustainable in the long run,” said Srinivasan.The two-wheeler industry will brace for more than one upward revision in price over the next 15 months. These will be as a result of the new safety norms from April 1 this year and the new emission standard norms from April 1, 2020. A combination of these will likely result in an increase of a minimum of Rs 8,000 (almost 20 percent jump) in prices of budget (100cc) two-wheelers.Currently, more than half of TVS’ sales come from scooters, which is where it has cemented its place as India’s second-largest scooter manufacturer. In the same price band, Hero sells its largest-selling motorcycle Splendor. Though both segments cater to different buyers, they fall in budget-buy segments, making them vulnerable to any hikes."

content,"One year after Suzuki launched their 650CC adventure tourer, the V-Strom has been upgraded with the XT Cross-Touring variant, with many added benefits as well as necessary changes. While mechanically the engine remains same, Suzuki has put the V-Strom under the knife, and it has resurfaced with an all new avatar. Here are some of the prominent updates.1.       Sleeker DesignTaking a cue from its bigger brother the V-Strom 1000, the XT gets a sleeker cowl with vertical configuration headlights. This slimming improves the rider view and overall gives a lighter feel when mounting the bike. The “beak” in front as well is not just aesthetic but helps to reduce the uplift by 9%.2.       Smoother EngineKeeping the shell of the 645CC V-twin engine same, Suzuki tweaked the engine with goods like resin-coated pistons— among 60 other components— to achieve a higher power output throughout the rev-range. All this while keeping the fuel consumption as low as possible.3.       Simpler instrument clusterIncorporating more elements from its V-Strom lineage, the new XT has a renewed instrument cluster, with more features and information at the rider’s disposal. Sporting a semi-digital design, the large analogue tachometer is complemented by a digital gear position indicator and a speedometer. Below it is the digital platform for the odometer, twin trip meter, clock, fuel level, coolant temperature, ambient temperature, battery voltage, the range on remaining fuel, average and instantaneous fuel consumptions, and traction-control modes.Apart from these, a revised traction control system, ABS and low RPM assist give the V-Strom XT a rugged feel and brings confidence to the rider."

Both of them also expressed solidarity with Banerjee.The development comes against the backdrop of Banerjee beginning a sit-in protest at a Kolkata landmark on Sunday night over the CBI's attempt to question the Kolkata Police chief in connection with chit fund scams, insisting it stifled the spirit of ""Constitution and federalism"".""It is political conspiracy to use the CBI against political opponents. Narendra Modi is elder to us and he should understand that PM comes and goes but the institutions of this great country remains. Whoever will not compromise with BJP they will be harassed by the CBI and other agencies,"" Yadav said.He said if all political parties don't unite then the people of this country ""will not forgive"" them.DMK leader Kanimozhi while expressing solidarity with Banerjee, said all the opposition parties should work towards staying united and work towards ensuring ""that BJP's dream of returning to power"" doesn't get fulfilled.""I would say that this episode was Modiji's pre-election gift to Mamata Banerjee as the BJP has realised after January 19 rally that they won't return to power after Lok Sabha polls,"" she said.The BJP and the RSS ""believe in divisive politics and in order to oust BJP, we should work together"", she said.Banerjee, while thanking both the leaders, said all the opposition parties are united and will fight ""till Modi is ousted from power"".""If we have to save India we have to oust Modi (Desh ko Bachana hain toh Modi toh Bhagana hain),"" she said.Earlier, before leaving for Kolkata, Yadav, son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, charged investigating agencies such as the CBI with harassment of political figures opposed to the BJP while treating those who switched over to the party in power at the Centre as ""Raja Harishchandra"",the legendary king renowned for his piety and justice.He had also targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for remaining equivocal on the showdown witnessed in West Bengal the previous day when Banerjee sat on a dharna in protest against CBI officers visiting the residence of the Kolkata Police Commissioner for questioning in a corruption case.""CBI, Income Tax department and Enforcement Directorate, all these agencies are being pressurised and hijacked. These are being made to function as wings of the BJP. And it was appalling to see Nitish Kumar, who claims to be a follower of Lohia and JP, evading queries earlier in the day on the latest developments in West Bengal"", the former Deputy CM of Bihar said.Kumar had during interaction with the media, sidestepped queries on the developments in the neighbouring state with the remark ""anything ... all types of things could happen in the period until Lok Sabha elections are announced and model code of conduct comes into force.""None"

description,This is the first such sequential drop in provision provided by the government since the launch of FAME scheme.
content,"NoneSubsidy for the current financial year stands at Rs 260 crore. This is the first such sequential drop in provision provided by the government since the scheme Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) was launched nearly four years ago.While the government had kept aside Rs 260 crore as subsidy for the current financial year (2018-19) it was revised downwards to Rs 145 crore.There has been a sequential growth in subsidy in the previous years. The actual subsidy in 2015-16 when the scheme was launched stood at Rs 74.99 crore. In 2016-17 government had budgeted Rs 122.90 crore. In 2017-18 the budget was for Rs 175 crore whereas the actual subsidy provided was Rs 165 crore.Only this year there was a significant drop in budget for subsidy. The revised budget of Rs 145 crore was 44 percent lower than the earlier budget of Rs 260 crore announced in the year 2017-18.The government provides subsidy on all class of electric and hybrid vehicles, ranging from two-wheelers to multi-seater buses. These cover scooters, vans, small cars, sedans, three wheelers, multi-utility vehicles and luxury buses.The subsidy amount ranges from Rs 7,500 to Rs 61 lakh. Subsidy provided by the government till date is Rs 316.46 crore as per the government website on FAME.On February 1, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal laid out a 10 point agenda for Vision 2030. Electric vehicles does get an important place in this vision. ""India will lead the energy revolution in the world with electric vehicles,"" Goyal said.NoneThe fully electric version of the same sedan, which is sold to a government backed company, is priced at little under Rs 12 lakh. Subsidies are therefore essential to make such vehicles as affordable as possible.Government is also believed to be working on laying down an additional cess on petrol and diesel powered vehicles that would help fund the subsidy required to keep demand for electric vehicles healthy. While details are not out yet but the cess could be put on two-wheelers as well."

title,Rain Industries: Adverse SC action has material impact on business model; stay cautious
datetime,2019-02-04 16:58:00+00:00
description,We have turned cautious on the stock and wait for management commentary and future action. 
content,"NoneHighlights:NoneNoneOn October 9, 2018, SC had allowed the domestic calcining industry to import up to 1.4 million tonne of GPC annually and permitted the domestic aluminium industry to use up to 0.5 million tonne of imported CPC per year. While the import ban lift was a relief for the calcining industry, it left a few questions unanswered pertaining to the business strategy of Rain Industries.NoneThe upper limit of GPC import Import limit of 1.4 million tonne of GPC applies for six companies (including Rain Industries and Goa Carbon) having a combined manufacturing capacity of 1.2 million tonne CPC. Post SC’s October decision, DGFT (Director General of Foreign Trade) issued guidelines for granting licenses on November 26, 2018. Thereafter, Rain Industries made an application for importing 352,145 tonne for the half-year period (ending March 31, 2019) which constitutes roughly 50 percent of the limit for the industry. However, DGFT issued a license for only 253,339 tonne.Only for this time i.e. period ending March’19, lower import volume license may not be onerous to operations as the permission was granted in November end. This means quota available is for four out of six months and hence capacity utilisation could be near 90 percent in the March quarter. However, it can be a big handicap going forward if the half year run rate of quota remains same. SC’s dismissal of the application suggests this being a base case.As per our calculation, for a complete half year period, the current quota would mean that plants are operating at 62 percent utilisation. And hence going forward if DGFT or SC doesn’t revise the limits, the company may have to go for low-grade petcoke to manufacture CPC in order to increase plant utilisation. As of now, the only leeway rests in the fact that SC judgement requires Calciners to have a Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) system that reduces sulphur dioxide emissions by more than 90 percent. It’s noteworthy that the company has an FGD system that removes nearly 98 percent of the facility's sulphur dioxide emissions. At the same time, a few of the Calciners who have been allocated import quota don’t have the FGD system in place.This means some scope of reallocation from other Calciners remains.GPC limit doesn’t account for future expansionSC permission accounts for current production requirement of the calcination industry but doesn’t account for future expansion plans. Now Rain Industries requires an additional 0.7 million tonne of GPC for the expansion in Vizag facility (370,000 tonne). It is noteworthy that the project had been on a schedule for completion by the end of current calendar year.However, SC’s dismissal of the petition from Rain industries for additional GPC requirement means that the expansion project could be shelved. Only leeway possible is because of the fact that the expansion project is located in SEZ which can provide the company with some flexibility in importing restricted raw materials.Calciners not permitted to import CPCNow Calciners are only permitted to import GPC and not CPC. The latter is only allocated to aluminium smelters. Rain Industries used to import CPC to blend it with CPC manufactured in Vizag facility so as to meet customer specification and improve margins. SC has not allowed any allowance on this front and so in this front company’s production and sales strategy will have to go substantial change.Given these developments, we have turned cautious on the stock and wait for management’s commentary and future action. While the stock valuation is enticing (low single-digit P/E multiple), we don’t suggest investors accumulate till further clarification emerges on the business operations and expansion.Additionally, we opine that the series of actions which are happening on the petcoke front appear to be akin to the environmental compliance efforts in China. And when read together with the strict environment compliance seen in other sub-segments of chemical industry such as Dyes and pigments, Amine industries, graphite electrodes imply that environmental compliance has emerged as one of the most crucial factors to watch for.Follow @anubhavsays"

title,Explainer | Should you invest more than Rs 1.5 lakh in tax-saving funds?
datetime,2019-02-18 15:43:00+00:00
description,One should not ignore the changing risk appetite of a person and the costs of investing in mutual funds.
content,"Tax saving mutual fund schemes or equity linked saving scheme (ELSS) are one of the most preferred options to save tax for most individuals. It comes with a three-year lock-in period. Although there is no restriction on the amount one can invest in it, investments up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year is exempt under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The recent budget kept the section 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lakh intact.Although no rule bans investments in excess of Rs 1.5 lakh per year, one should not invest money in excess of what is required in ELSS. Primary reason behind this is the three-year in lock in period. Financial planners advise investing in equity mutual funds with long-time frame – typically in excess of five years and in that case three-year lock-in is not a hindrance. It makes sense to invest in a product for long-term by choice and not out of force.ELSS portfolios comprise stocks of companies of all sizes – large, mid and small. This is akin to a multi-cap portfolio. Over 10 years, multi cap mutual funds have given 17.66 percent returns whereas ELSS has given 17.18 percent returns, according to Value Research as on February 1, 2019. Over the past five-year time period, multi-cap funds gave 16.23 percent returns and ELSS gave 16.31 percent returns. To put it straight, the ELSS schemes with lock in do not offer more than the multi-cap funds with no lock in.One should also not ignore the changing risk appetite of a person and the costs of investing in mutual funds. The risk appetite of a person may go down over a period of time and for him it may be a prudent idea to stick to large cap stocks.In that case one would be better off with large cap equity funds. The large cap equity funds offer less returns compared to ELSS, but they are less volatile. For example, large cap funds recorded standard deviation of 14.31 for the 3-year period ending as on January 31, 2019, whereas ELSS funds recorded standard deviation 15.14 over the same period. Standard deviation measures volatility and seen as a measure of risk. Low number connotes low risk.ELSS funds charge expense ratios in the range of 1.46 percent to 2.88 percent, whereas if one intends to invest through an index fund (for large cap exposure), then the expense ratios are in the range of 20 basis points to 2%. In case of large cap focussed ETF tracking Nifty, the same goes down to 5 basis points.What’s the need to invest in an ELSS then? Given that the returns aren’t exceedingly more than diversified funds, there’s no pressing need to invest more than what’s required to get you the tax benefits.Then again, the basket of instruments available for us to invest to get the section 80C tax deduction benefits is dominated by fixed income instruments where, apart from public provident fund, interest income is taxed. All of them come with long lock-ins. ELSS is the only pure equity vehicle and it also comes with a shorter lock-in of three years.If you must invest in an ELSS fund, provided you still have space to invest in section 80C basket of instruments after your employee provident fund and public provident fund, have a 5-year time horizon at least to improve your chances of earning decent returns over your fixed income instruments. But given the wide variety of risk levels between the bouquet of tax-saving funds on offer, it makes to stick to those that are diversified."

title,Egypt wants to wean away Bajaj Auto’s rickshaw drivers to help build a new Cairo instead

description,"Nearly a fourth of Bajaj Auto’s three-wheeler overseas shipments head to Egypt, making it the second largest market in the world for the Pune-based company after Sri Lanka"
content,"The Egyptian government is building itself a new capital from scratch and strangely this is sending shockwaves around 5,000 kms away to Bajaj Auto, which supplies three-wheelers (3Ws) to that country.NoneBut in late November 2018, Egypt Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli called for a restriction on free imports of three-wheelers (locally called toktoks) into the country in a push to make its youth take up ‘serious jobs that can help develop and build the country’.Rakesh Sharma, director, Bajaj Auto, said, “There was some discussion in the (Egyptian) government of curtailing the imports of three wheelers because of a really ludicrous logic of labour getting employed as 3W drivers and not being available for building the new Cairo (new capital)”.During Q3 FY19, the maker of motorcycles such as Pulsar and Avenger exported 90,426 units of 3Ws from India, a year-on-year growth of 24 percent.Though 3W export growth during the third quarter was in healthy double-digits, it was the slowest of the three quarters for the year led by Egypt. In Q1, Bajaj Auto 3W exports grew 69 percent, whereas in Q2 the segment clocked 49 percent over the corresponding quarter last year. This notable growth was a result of pre-buying by Bajaj Auto’s distributors in Egypt.“As a preemptive step, our importer and distributor in Egypt decided to advance a lot of the purchases just in case the government takes some punitive action for one or two months. So, we will see a kicker in the international business purely on account of extra volumes from Egypt,” Sharma added.While the Bajaj toktok has become a household name as it is the most preferred means of transport in Eqypt not just for locals but for millions of tourists visiting each year to see the pyramids, it has also invited the ire of government authorities.As early as 2014, the Egypt Industry Ministry decided to stop imports of toktoks as it was found that the three-wheeled passenger carriers were used in committing crimes as well in terrorist attacks. Several of such vehicles were found to be invalid and driven by youths without driving license. However, subsequently the ban lifted and imports resumed.Now as a means to appease to the government, Bajaj Auto has announced plans to set-up a factory in Egypt that would manufacture the toktoks."

description,"Foreign investors raised stake in as many as 387 companies including HDFC, Bharat Financial, Indiabulls Housing, IndusInd Bank, Shriram Transport, Bharti Infratel, Zee Entertainment and Hero Moto"
content,"Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), which were net sellers in Indian markets both in equities as well as debt segment for the December quarter, raised stake in nearly 400 companies in the same period, data from Ace Equity showed.Foreign investors raised stake in as many as 387 companies from previous quarter which includes HDFC, Bharat Financial Inclusion, Indiabulls Housing Finance, IndusInd Bank, Shriram Transport, Bharti Infratel, ZEE Entertainment and Hero MotoCorp.Here is a list of top 20 stocks according to percentage holding from the list of 387 companies:NoneAccording to data from SEBI, foreign investors were net sellers in October 2018 but then poured money in the following two months i.e. November and December to the tune of Rs 21,000 crore. But, on net basis, FIIs were net sellers in December quarter in both equity and debt, selling assets worth approximately Rs 17,000 crore.During 2018, they pulled out more than Rs 75,000 crore, including both debt and equity, data showed. FPIs were not just net sellers in India markets in 2018, but they pulled out money from other emerging markets also on the back of strengthening dollar and increasing yields in the US. Specifically for India, higher crude oil prices and fall in rupee added to FIIs' woes.NoneDespite recent selling by FIIs, analysts are hopeful that foreign investors will return as India still commands higher growth rate when compared to other emerging markets, and further fall in crude oil will only strengthen the macro case for India.Piyush Goyal in the Interim Budget speech reiterated that India is poised to become a USD 5-trillion economy in the next five years and aspires to become a USD 10-trillion economy in the next 8 years thereafter.Stating that India is solidly back on track and marching towards growth and prosperity, he said the last five years have seen India being universally recognised as a bright spot of the global economy, he said.Last month, IMF in a report said that India will further build its lead as the world’s fastest-growing major economy as it picks up pace next year while the global economy is forecast to slow.India’s GDP is forecast to expand 7.5 percent in FY20 and 7.7 percent in FY21. China’s growth is seen at 6.2 percent in both years. However, there is still election overhang which could mean that flows could remain tepid till some clarity emerges.“The political arena is wide open and most political pundits have been talking about 3 likely outcomes. However, the markets may still prefer a stable government so that the economic reforms process is not dented. It would be presumptuous to imagine that India would be totally immune to a global slowdown,” Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol in an interview in January.“However, considering its low dependence on exports and a fairly large trade deficit, the slowdown should work in India’s favour. Any global slowdown is likely to hit oil prices and that would benefit India’s trade deficit. It must be also said that Indian markets may be best equipped to decouple from the global volatility in the medium term,” he said.The IMF cut the global growth forecast from last October’s estimate. The global economy is projected to grow 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points below last October’s projections.FIIs reduced stake in 568 companies in the December quarter which include names like Axis Bank, KPIT Technologies, ICICI Bank, UPL, Cox & Kings, HDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra, NIIT Technologies, Yes Bank, Infosys, IDFC, MindTree, Cyient, M&M, RIL, Cipla etc. among others.They kept their holding constant in as many as 384 companies in December quarter which include names like Tata Steel, Visa Steel, Globus Power, DFM Foods, Kirloskar Industries, Voltamp Transformers, Camson Bio Technologies etc. among others."

title,These skills will help you master algorithmic trading
datetime,2019-02-04 18:42:00+00:00
description,A list of skills that are potential algo trader needs to acquire
content,"Nitesh KhandelwalNoneAlgorithmic trading has a lot of, might I say 'components' like programming, quantitative analysis techniques, and much more. Some pursue learning in this domain to keep ahead of the times, while others do it for a passion of technology, or to create benefits, upgrade their skills, get their dream job or to simply be future ready.Giants from the industry - trading firms, brokers, global banks, investment firms, etc. continue to adopt technological advancements. They are always on a lookout to hire individuals who have acquired the relevant skills important in this domain. They need people with algorithmic trading skills. But then, there is the big question - what key algorithmic trading skills would they be looking for?Here are some vital skills if you aspire to become a part of this domain:Mathematical prowess i.e. the knowledge of statistics, mathematical models, statistical research methods govern your quantitative skills. It doesn’t make sense limiting your approach to only number crunching agility. You are expected to know about finding suitable models to define randomness or calculate asset price movements, examine the statistical properties of market data, etc. With the quantity of data available with you, these skills are a weapon in your arsenal constantly firing off and steadily modifying your techniques, programs, strategies and evolving your algorithms in these rapidly moving markets.Coding or programming is another key skill that is very much essential to pick in order to become a successful algorithmic trader. Contrary to popular belief, programming is not just a requirement to automate a trading strategy but is also required through most of the trading life cycle. An algorithmic and quantitative trader uses programming right from validating the strategy hypothesis, to modelling and from back-testing and optimisation, to execution. With the rise of data sciences, Python has become the world's most popular programming language in 2017-18, including in the financial markets.Any type of trading methodology needs a clear understanding and knowledge of the financial markets. All the statistical prowess and programming skills are of no use if you don't understand the concepts of financial markets and trading in general. What type of concepts are we talking about here? It requires an understanding of basic terminologies like bid-ask to understanding the fundamental reasons for price movement in stocks or in any asset class that you intend to trade.Trading is the perfect platform to help you put into practice your problem-solving capabilities. It is an important skill that will really benefit you while coming up with the trade ideas, as well as while modelling those ideas. Modelling strategies can be complex at times and strong problem-solving skills help in coming up with intuitive solutions and frameworks.Getting access to quality data is important for any kind of trader. While there are ample sources of data available for daily price data, access to historical intraday data can be restricted. It is important to understand the patterns of data from across various markets and exchanges across the globe. One of the most important tasks for a trader/analyst is cleaning the data, structuring it to be uniform with the database (e.g. converting integers, floating decimals, etc.), and then using it to identify patterns, create and optimise strategies. Please do note that while price and volume data has a high prevalence in most trading strategies, there are other data sets that algorithmic traders often manage like the data related to the economy, sentiment, fundamentals, etc.As important as it is to know how to use a trading system, it is also important to know the inside of a trading system. An algorithmic trader needs to know about various components of a trading system including the adaptors, Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine, etc. Further, it is important to know about the infrastructure aspects from both hardware and network perspective. This part is an absolute necessity if one intends to trade HFT strategies. In the case of medium or low-frequency strategies, a basic understanding of these things can work too.Risk management is another important component. The strategies will help you make money, but your risk management system is the one that is often responsible for preserving it. In any kind of trading, market risk is something that a trader is trying to mitigate through various means. In the case of automated trading, mitigating operational risk takes the centre-stage. I often tell our EPAT course participants that when you are trading manually, you have a very powerful risk management tool with you, which is common sense. When it comes to a machine, that critical part is missing and you’ve to take care of that by carefully adding the appropriate risk checks in your strategy and overall code base.Every country and region has its own set of regulations and compliance requirements that it must adhere to trade in the respective trading destinations. There are rules related to short-selling, co-location, system approvals, etc. that one needs to know about. For example, some exchanges would need the approval to be taken at an overall system level, while in other exchanges (in India as well as few other countries), you need to get approval at each strategy level. Additionally, if you intend to trade/manage other people’s money, knowledge of regulations becomes even more critical.So, dive right in. #GoAlgo and be a part of this industry.The author is the co-founder of QuantInsti, an Algorithmic Trading training institute."

content,"NoneDuggal was with Dabur for over 24 years. He will remain a whole-time director till May 15, 2019 and continue as a non-executive director till July 30, 2020.The company had put in place a succession planning strategy, through which it chose Dabur veteran Mohit Malhotra as the company's new chief executive officer. Malhotra is currently the head of the company's India business.Malhotra will work as CEO-Designate till March 31, 2019, under Duggal's guidance.Malhotra, 49, is a management graduate from Pune University and a Masters in International Business from Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, New Delhi.He joined Dabur as a management trainee in 1994, and handled key assignments in marketing and sales. He rose to become CEO of Dabur International, based out of Dubai, before taking charge as the CEO -India Business in his current position.Duggal’s legacyDabur India, owned by the Burman family, went through a sluggish growth period in the late 80s.

They quit executive positions, almost overnight.Fast forward to 2002, the current CEO, Sunil Duggal, took over. He made a slew of acquisitions -- taking Dabur into home hygiene, nonherbal skin care and ethnic hair care.He also beefed up Dabur's international presence, from Nepal to Europe and even US. A few acquisitions in Turkey strengthened its business in the Middle East and Africa.On Duggal’s tenure, the company's revenue rose 7.5 times, EBITDA was up 23.5 times, while PAT jumped 22-fold. This resulted in handsome gains for the stock -- its market cap rose 45 times, with the stock price moving up from Rs 10 to Rs 450.The challenge for the new CEO would be to sustain the high growth rates achieved by his predecessor."

Further, a change in fuel mix (75 percent gas and 25 percent imported coal) have alleviated some of the cost pressures- New business segments (sanitaryware, faucets and plywood) continued to expand at a rapid pace. Revenue from this segment jumped to Rs 55 crore in Q3 FY19 from Rs 35 crore year-on-year- Kajaria’s joint ventures, which have been a drag on the financial performance of the company, is witnessing a steady turnaround.

Tile industry growth has been flat-to-negative in the past two years. However, the outlook looks optimistic as the sector is expected to grow in mid-single digits next fiscal- While input costs appears to have peaked out in Q2 and Q3, a further increase in natural gas prices (linked to crude oil and rupee dollar movements) from current levels could have a bearing on the company's marginNone- The company is also planning to expand its polished vitrified tiles capacity at Malutana, Rajasthan to 12.1 MSM by FY20-end from 6.5 MSM at presentNoneNone- The market has taken cognisance of its robust performance in the past two quarters and the stock price has also seen a recovery from the lows seen in October last year.

This, despite PM Modi having more followers than Gandhi.NoneNoneA Congress leader quoted by the news agency blamed mainstream media for the traction that Gandhi's tweets have been gaining. The leader reasoned that since the media is ""pro-Modi"" and against the Congress president, his social media presence gets more attention.""As the content of the tweets often make it to the instant messaging platform WhatsApp which has a wider reach in rural India than Twitter, greater retweets of Rahul's messages is good news for the Grand Old Party,"" the leader said.However, social media expert Anoop Mishra cautioned that a greater number of retweets does not necessarily mean the person's influence has also expanded.""What they indicate is people's interest in the subject that has been tweeted,"" Mishra said.

datetime,2019-10-17 18:53:00+00:00
description,The deal with Ranbaxy made Chigurupati overnight billionaire. Flush with cash he went on to acquire and set up at least a dozen companies.
content,"In the wee hours of February 1, the Nandigama police of Andhra Pradesh found a man in a grey half sleeved shirt lying dead, in the rear seat of a white Maruti Suzuki Ciaz in a paddy field abutting the National Highway 65 stretch in Andhra Pradesh.Initially, passersby assumed it to be another gruesome road accident, as the bustling highway that connects between Hyderabad and Vijayawada frequently witnesses such sights.Later, the police identified the dead person as 57-year old serial entrepreneur Jayaram Chigurupati and soon found it wasn't a road accident but cold-blooded murder.While the motive for the murder is still being investigated, local media reports allege the murder could be an outcome of messy financial dealings. Two names that have come up prominently are Chigurupati's niece Shika Chaudhary and her boyfriend Rakesh Reddy. Their role in the murder is also being investigated.It was a gruesome end to an entrepreneurial career that saw many a high.Biotech boomBy late 80s, Jayaram Chigurupati popularly called as Jay, had completed his PhD in biochemical genetics from the University of Hyderabad and was already wondering what he would venture into next.In those days, when India was still reeling under the license raj, the private sector was nascent and opportunities in the government were far and few. So the popular option for people qualified in cutting edge of science was to migrate to the US.Chigurupati did just that.To fulfill his American dream he enrolled into an MBA programme at Cornell University and started working as a Technology Transfer Consultant at the Center of Advanced Technology, Cornell University. He later joined consulting practice at Wilkerson Group in the New York City helping pharmaceutical and healthcare companies of the US.Chigurupati's specialisation, his network, business acumen and timing put him in an enviable position, as the biotech sector in the US was just taking off with drugs built on recombinant DNA technology increasingly getting approved by US FDA, and were raking in millions of dollars.Recombinant technology helps produce therapeutic proteins that are almost impossible to replicate synthetically. In recombinant technology microorganisms such as bacteria are genetically modified to express these proteins. An example of such protein is insulin, naturally produced by the pancreas and helps in converting sugar into energy. For people suffering from diabetes, the pancreas gradually loses the ability to produce insulin and such people can be treated by injecting insulin.In the early days, insulin used to be derived from the pancreas' of cows and pigs, but it wasn't ideal in terms of purity, tolerance and safety. It was also super expensive to produce.In 1982, when USFDA approved the human insulin produced by California-based drug maker Genentech using recombinant technology, it spawned an entirely new field called biotech. Genentech was later acquired by Swiss drug major Roche.The recombinant insulin wasn't just safe and tolerable but could be produced at a mass scale, making it affordable for insulin-dependent diabetes patients.The recombinant technology helped produce not just insulins but antibodies, growth hormones, and clotting factors that were used as drugs and diagnostic kits.The launch of India's first biosimilarNoneFor entrepreneurs like Reddy, it wasn't just the ambition; they now had access to capital to invest in new streams like biotechnology, coupled with a liberal patent regime, that didn't recognise product patents.But Biotechnology needed more than capital. It needed expertise and access to technology. The generic drug industry was built on India's formidable chemistry skills, but biology is an area that we lagged behind.Reddy's hunt for such expertise finally ended, with Jayaram Chigurupati.Chigurupati was tasked to build the biotechnology business for Dr Reddy's as Senior Vice President.Chigurupati told this reporter sometime back that he was hired by Reddy's son Satish Reddy, and was given a free hand to operate and enjoyed the confidence of Anji Reddy. He was among the top three in that organisation at one point in time.Within no time Chigurupati led the team that launched India's first biosimilar filgrastim (Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)) in 2001.Chigurupati recollected with amusement how the launch of biosimilar filgrastim sparked litigation, as Nicholas Piramal (now sold to Abbott), which was distributing the drug under a licensing pact with Roche sued Dr Reddy's.Dr Reddy's got away with a minor reprimand by the court that asked the company to rename the drug that was near identical to the branded version.The team went on to develop a pipeline of biosimilars and cancer drugs.Dr Reddy's foray into biotechnology was interesting because it was done without technical tie-ups or collaborations with academic institutes or companies outside India.Chigurupati said it was possible because he identified the people who had those capabilities and backed them.Joining hands with RanbaxyBy early 2000s, Chigurupati was no longer on good terms with Dr Reddy's. He declined to reveal what led to his separation from Dr Reddy's but people who tracked those developments say Chigurupati was ambitious and had been plotting to launch a separate company, making the same set of products that he developed at Dr Reddy's. There were also talks about patent disputes between Dr Reddy's and Chigurupati.NoneMalvinder Singh of Ranbaxy Laboratories, India's largest drugmaker then was looking to enter biosimilars (It was then called bio-generics). He found a willing partner in Chigurupati and first struck a partnership with him by taking a 10 percent stake in Zenotech. Within a year, he raised the stake to 45 percent by paying Rs 234 crore in 2007.Singh didn't stop there. He signed a definitive agreement, under which Ranbaxy would raise its stake further by buying shares of promoters at Rs 160 per share through a preferential allotment by Zenotech. Ranbaxy acquired a further 2.20 percent in January 2008 through an open offer at Rs. 160 per share.The deal stipulated that Zenotech develop and make regulatory filings for 11 oncology products while Ranbaxy would be responsible for marketing generic versions of the drugs in the US and Canada.But Singh brothers soon sold Ranbaxy to Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo, and Daiichi reduced the offer to Rs. 113.62 per share. Chigurupati cried foul and started challenging the open offer in various courts.Meanwhile, the biosimilar business of Ranbaxy never really took off and Zenotech simply crumbled. Chigurupati was forcefully evicted from Zenotech by Daiichi.None""It was a disastrous acquisition for Ranbaxy,"" said an executive who also runs a vaccine company in the vicinity of Zenotech plant at Genome Valley in Hyderabad.Losing focus and lifeThe deal with Ranbaxy made Chigurupati an overnight billionaire. Flush with cash he went on to acquire and set up at least a dozen companies.The list included a local area bank, an asset management company, a contact lenses firm, a seed company, a sugar mill, 24x7 Telugu news channel, film production, real estate and a blood protein company.He lived in a plush locality (even by American standards) of Jupiter, Florida, and travelled frequently to India to manage companies here.Beneath all that glitter, things were falling apart.People close to him said he lost focus, and his bets on most businesses went horribly wrong.He defaulted on salaries to hundreds of employees. People working at his contact lenses' company and news channel were on the roads, protesting before his office for payment of dues.At least two employees in the news channel were said to have committed suicide due to financial difficulties after they lost jobs.""He relied on shady people to run the affairs for him, his eccentric ways and his unsavoury personal relationships have all undone him,"" said a person who knew Chigurupati for years.He was essentially taking out money from one company, to pay salaries in the other. He was also borrowing money from outside, the person above said.""His wife, aware of mismanagement, took charge of assets, bank accounts and even power to write cheques. He was in a cash crunch situation. His murder may have been linked to non-repayment of Rs 4.5 crore loan he took from this person called Rakesh Reddy,"" the person above added.In all his businesses, Hemarus Therapeutics, that makes blood proteins, such as Hemophilia Factor IX for treating Hemophilia B patients, Fibrin sealant used in surgery and Factor VIII for Hemophilia A, is the only one that's doing okay."

description,"Recently, company officials had hinted that production and sales of the Nano would stop from April 2020 as Tata Motors has no plans to invest further on Ratan Tata's dream car to meet strict emission norm under BS-VI and other upcoming safety regulations."
content,"Amid speculation over the future of Tata Motors' Nano, the company in January did not produce nor sell even a single unit of the small car, which was once dubbed as the 'people's car'.Recently, company officials had hinted that production and sales of the Nano would stop from April 2020 as Tata Motors has no plans to invest further on Ratan Tata's dream car to meet strict emission norm under BS-VI and other upcoming safety regulations.According to a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said zero unit of Nano was produced in January this year as against 83 units in the same month last year.Similarly, there were no sales of Nano in the domestic market last month as compared to 62 units in January 2018.In terms of exports, the company did not ship any unit of the model last month same as it was in the year-ago month.When contacted, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, ""As mentioned before, the Nano in its current form will not meet the new safety and emission norms and may need infusion of fresh investments.""No decision has been made yet in this regard. We continue to produce Nano catering to customer demands.""The spokesperson further said decisions on product life cycle are a holistic view taken after considering the market developments, regulations and emerging competitive landscape and decisions are announced as and when they are taken.""Production planning of a car is a conscious management of demand, system inventory and planned efficiencies. Therefore, speculating on the fate of a car based on a month's production figure is something the company would not like to participate in,"" the spokesperson added.In June last year, the company produced just one unit of the Nano and sold three units in the domestic market.After that the company continued to produce Nano at its Sanand plant based on market demand and has insisted that it hasn't taken a decision on the future of Nano.The Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people's car, could not live up to the billing. The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to Rs 1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that ""a promise is a promise"".However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors' proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition.The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat. Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn't help its cause either.Ratan Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as 'the cheapest car'.It became a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even going on to claim that the Nano ""consistently lost value, peaking at Rs 1,000 crore"".Mistry had also termed the Nano as one of the ""legacy hotspots"" and there was ""no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy""."

The calculated GRM for the quarter comes to around $3.5-4 per barrel. There has been an expected weakness in GRMs globally with the Singapore benchmark at $4.5 per barrel, as compared to $6.1 in Q2.-Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) saw a sharp 70 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline, in comparison to a drop of 54 percent sequentially over high inventory losses, an increase in input costs, employee expenses and finance costs.-A sharp correction in global crude prices since October 2018 has led to a substantial inventory loss for the company which ate away at the quarters' profitability. This compares to an inventory gain in the same quarter last year.-Other expenses saw a noticeable cut, which worked a bit in favour of margins.

description,"The Nano will not get any regulatory upgrades, unlike its peers, that are essential to keep it going the mini car will have to be phased out."
content,"NoneAs indicated by the company, Nano, unlike its peers, will not get any regulatory upgrades essential to keep it going.From 83 units in January 2018, the production of Nano hit zero in the same month this year. This is the first time since its launch in 2008 that not a single Nano was either produced or sold in any month.The Nano was pulled out of export markets such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since the start of the calendar last year.“As mentioned before, the Nano in its current form will not meet the new safety and emission norms and may need an infusion of fresh investments. No decision has been made yet in this regard. We continue to produce Nano catering to customer demands,” said a statement from Tata Motors.For the past several months Tata Motors has been producing the Nano as per orders confirmed by its dealers. However, it was getting increasingly difficult to manage the production of the Nano alongside other models such as Tiago and Tigor at the Gujarat plant, which is running at full capacity. The mini car’s old generation build had to be matched with the new generation Tiago on the same production line.While the company has not agreed to phase out the Nano completely for the time being, it will have to mandatorily bring an end to the car‘s production by March 31, 2019. As none of the variants of the Nano houses an airbag the model will not be allowed to be produced after April 1, 2019, which is when all cars sold in India will need to have at least one airbag.“Decisions on product life cycle is a holistic view taken after considering the market developments, regulations and emerging competitive landscape. Any such decisions are announced as and when it’s taken. Production planning of a car is conscious management of demand, system inventory and planned efficiencies. Therefore, speculating on the fate of a car based on a month’s production figure is something the company would not like to participate in,” the statement further added.As per government directives, auto companies will be allowed to sell cars without airbags after March 31, 2019, but will not be allowed to produce them.Commercially launched in March 2009 (but first unveiled at a glitzy Auto Expo event in 2008) as the ‘Rs 1 lakh car’ the Nano saw several iterations in its decade long career. Ratan Tata’s car gathered iconic status and praise from across the world even from renowned European and Japanese companies that called it an engineering marvel.However, despite multiple efforts including adding a boot space in the rear, power steering option, CNG fuel option and even a repositioning of the brand, the Nano failed to rise.Last year, Tata Motors decided it will take forward only those projects under the ‘Fit for Future’ programme which are commercially viable. The company is ready to bring down the axe on a number of ageing models that have become a drag on its financials."

title,Podcast | Accidental Investopreneur: How Dhirendra Kumar built his portfolio and business
datetime,2019-02-06 19:34:00+00:00
description,Dhirendra’s foray into the world of mutual funds coincided with the opening up of the sector in the early 1990s. He is considered a pioneer in mutual fund research and analysis.
content,"Way back in the early 90s, when Dhirendra Kumar was just out of college, he managed to convince his parents to break a part of their fixed deposits and invest that money in mutual funds. Fortunately for Kumar, his parents backed their son's instinct and even more fortunately for them, the value of their investment sky rocketed in a mere 18 months. That was the starting point for Kumar's journey into the world of mutual funds.Value Research, the name of the firm founded by Kumar, was born after he received his first paycheck from a leading business daily for a bunch of articles on disinvestment.""I had to craft a name then and there. Value Research. It was not a well-thought-out thing,"" says Dhirendra recalling that day.""It was not an incorporated company. It was not even a proprietary firm then. So, after I got my cheque as compensation for those 10 company reports, published in Economic Times I went to open a bank account in that name,"" he says.In a podcast with Moneycontrol, Kumar recounts his journey and learnings as an investor and an entrepreneur.NoneBelow is the edited transcript of Dhirendra Kumar's conversation with MoneycontrolHello and welcome to Moneycontrol Podcast. I am Santosh Nair and with me is Dhirendra Kumar, Founder and Chief Executive of Value Research which runs the mutual fund portal valueresearchonline.com. Dhirendra’s foray into the world of mutual funds coincided with the opening up of the sector in the early 90s. He is considered a pioneer in mutual fund research and analysis. In addition, Dhirendra also edits two monthly magazines, and writes columns on financial planning, capital market policies and market trends. Thanks for joining us on this podcast, Dhirendra.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThose dossiers, resulting from three years of boredom, turned out to be wonderful assets. So, my starting point was not mutual funds. My starting point was equity research. I was curious about equity. I was just trying to figure out how things work, and this was also pre-Harshad Mehta, pre-securities scam. I was curious and there was no information available. I had a lot of questions and trying to find those answers and information. There was no CNBC and there was no internet.Those days, all you could do was try and figure out things, try and read things. I was able to put those dossiers and was able to put together a piece which I thought was a little ahead of time. I was able to write stock reports on all the public sector companies, which were likely to go public. The government was thinking of disinvestment. So, that was my early initiative.As a student, I was alone and that was the start of Value Research, in that sense because the public sector disinvestment was announced. I was still in college. I had just landed up at The Economic Times and those were easy days—pre-terrorism—so access was easy. I just walked into Swaminathan Aiyar’s office. He saw my work and said, “Why don’t we publish it today onward, we will carry it as a series”. Ten companies’ disinvestments were announced. So, that is how Value Research got started. I had to craft a name then and there. Value Research. It was not a well-thought-out thing. It was not an incorporated company. It was not even a proprietary firm then. So, after I got my cheque as compensation for those 10 company reports, published in Economic Times I went to open a bank account in that name. So that was the start of Value Research and then the disinvestment happened and then the mutual fund thing was actually a side thing. In 1990, I persuaded my parents to break their fixed deposit and invest in mutual funds.NoneNoneEquity mutual funds actually democratised something which was otherwise not accessible to individual investor. Magnum Multiplier Scheme 1990 was the fourth such equity mutual fund. Equity mutual funds were not big then. And the three that were there, the one which existed before that, one was Master Share (UTI) of course. Then we had Canshare and there was another one. And then this MMS 90. So I persuaded my parents to invest in this mutual fund.NoneNoneI was able to persuade them to invest a few lakh rupees and that was quite a remarkable thing because few lakh rupees in those times was quite a bit because we are talking about thirty years ago. That apart, the money actually turned 18 times in flat 18 months. So, this Rs 10 invested became Rs 180, thanks to the great Indian scam and the absolute unawareness about it.This is when my mutual fund thing came in. I was a believer in fact-led thinking and all I did was put together a scorecard of all mutual funds. There were 80 funds then of which only 7-8 were equity funds; remaining were hybrids and fixed income. I was able to put together their names and found they were all closed-end funds.So the basic features like when they started, when they will expire, their maturity date, what are the terms of their maturity, any interim liquidity that will be enabled by the fund company because there used to be partial repurchase possible for something like Master Gain and things like that. There will be start of repurchase, and they were all listed. You could buy them at a steep discount or a big premium and get their net asset value.The disclosure of mutual fund information at that point was absolutely ridiculous. We used to get the NAV of a mutual fund every quarter and that too with a two-month lag and that was also supposed to get published in some hidden newspaper in some back page. You know most of the time it will be appearing in Afternoon Dispatch and Courier or something like that. The cheapest newspaper advertising would be bought by fund companies to do that statutory publishing of those NAVs. I had a piece of information which others didn’t have and putting it all together I was able to make a whole story.I was able to understand that all the funds are trading at 10 times-20 times their NAV because the Magnum Multiplier scheme which I was telling you which multiplied 18 times, the NAV of that was about Rs 20 and in May 1992 it was trading at Rs 180 in the market.NoneNoneSo we had access to wonderful knowledge repository where we could see how things were done elsewhere because there was a huge information gap. So that was it. Once I did this I persuaded my parents to sell those investments. That Rs 3 lakh becoming 18 times was quite something. But I decoded something else. What I realised was that money gives you freedom and I saw it happening live. Before that, I was studying and it looked like a game; but it is not a game. It makes a difference to the way you think, your plans, your life plans, gives you freedom, gives you choice. I saw that happening in my parents’ life. My father had planned that he will retire and build his house. That’s how it used to happen those days. He was able to prepone that plan.His plans for my sister’s wedding underwent a change in terms of being a little liberal, or being a little more exploratory and things like that. So, I saw those not life impacting but definitely making impactful changes. It can mean different things to different people at different stages, but it was just not a game. And mutual fund at that point was in a state of infancy.I thought that this is something which looks very promising. It is accessible to anybody, it is simple and it has the potential and it is making something accessible which is otherwise not accessible, desirable to have.So, I was able to put together a scorecard of mutual funds. I went back to Swaminathan Aiyar again and he was a ready buyer. That piece of work as well started getting published from that day onwards. So, my mutual fund scorecard appeared in what is now discontinued Investor’s Guide of Economic Times which used to get published every Monday. It continued for the next decade. And that was the start of Value Research. That was my first brush with mutual funds. Personal experience, the commercial experience and the start of the scorecard and for the next five years it carried on.NoneNoneNoneNoneAt one point, there was a very interesting incident. I went to a fund company to ask for the NAV and they said, “We haven’t calculated it. Why don’t you help us do that?” They gave me the ledger, multiply the number of shares with current price. There used to be a printed bhav copy (daily record of stock prices along with volume of shares traded). So, I was made to write down the prices of closing prices of stocks from the bhav copy into that ledger so that the multiplication got easier. So, I contributed a little bit to the calculation of the NAV at a couple of fund companies. But mostly immediately after the scorecard became popular, I was generally welcomed and I was quite not, I would not say pampered, but surely seen as an acceptable evil. Because I was just putting everything in the public domain and bringing greater transparency. And I saw there were other things. Almost all mutual fund schemes used to trade at a huge premium to NAV around the great Indian scam in 1992. Soon after publication of the scorecard, the premium disappeared. They started trading at a discount. And then I saw the birth and the emergence of the modern mutual fund. Because all what I am telling you is the pre-SEBI days.SEBI mutual fund regulations became effective in 1993, which coincided with the emergence of the private sector. So, we saw the Kothari Pioneer and Morgan Stanley making an entry. So witnessing that the start of the open-ended funds, the disbelief in the start of open-end mutual fund, Kothari Pioneer, initial focus on creating awareness that you will not get a mutual fund certificate but you will get an account statement from here on, persuading the fund companies to share their portfolio with us, that is a very interesting story.I went to UTI to seek portfolio information and I was told that it is very secret information and they were not supposed to disclose it and rightly so. There was no law requiring them to share it with me if quarterly NAV disclosure was the norm. I was denied that information. I then threw a carrot that if you share your portfolio, then I will be able to write about it and you will benefit as a result of it and without information what do I say about Master Share. But it did not work. But I was able to derive the portfolio of UTI from Parliament Library and being in Delhi was quite advantageous because it was set up under the Parliamentary statuette and they had to do their annual filing and UTI annual report was filed in Parliament every year. So that was my first discovery that if information is there in the public domain and you create awareness and anything which is based on facts, getting your point across gets easy. I was not giving anything out of my hat. It was not a random thing. It was based on facts, publicly disclosed information. So that was the start of many interesting stories because for the first 10 years I was hands on, I was doing everything. I used to input the NAVs, I used to design the scorecard, I used to deliver the scorecard at Economic Times at midnight every Friday. So it was interesting.NoneNoneNoneNoneSN: And how has your style of management changed? Over the first 10 years, you said you were pretty hands on. After that?NoneI was always producing that scorecard for Economic Times, so I understood the deadline, the need for accuracy. So many of those values were not determined by the policy of the respective companies.They were my personal values which evolved. You will be out of business if you are not right. Your margin of error is very small if you are a vendor. Nobody is going to excuse you for a mistake. So I was extremely careful. The rigour of work to be done came because of that, it was entirely out of fear that it would be embarrassing. Besides, you would be out of business. You will be unemployed and you will starve to death. That was the primary drive.We do at Value Research everything. Then the television thing happened, then the internet happened. There is a story at the start of every business. It was a not planned thing. We started our Value Research online which was once again not an implementation of a plan. Just that in 1999, a lot of internet companies came. They all wanted to start a mutual fund website as of yesterday. And they were big companies. GE Capital, go4i—a Hindustan Times company—including Moneycontrol . So, everybody was my customer for information. We had 50 such companies, more than 50 such companies which came into being. And in a matter of one and half years, they all disappeared. We were lucky to get the money. I built the capacity to serve those customers with the technologies arm, which was built from scratch and that was the time when we hurriedly did that because before that Value Research database was a long large number of Excel files because data wasn’t much. And I knew each and every piece of data because I was so hands on. I still remember most of the starting date and end date and terms of the mutual fund schemes. We formulated the classification system, which has now evolved into the SEBI’s classification system because the initial classification system was closed-end funds, hybrids, open for repurchase. The classification system was not objective driven. This is what happened in 1999. The start of Value Research online was entirely an accident because I had to deploy those people who had built the capacity to handle that data and Value Research came into being and all others died. We only have four companies which have existed since then of our customers. ICICI Direct, Economic Times.com and Moneycontrol.NoneNoneI think since 1999 I was able to build enough resources so that I can plan medium term and long term, because before that it was living on a day to day basis. Whatever margins, whatever surplus we will create, some of the assets would guzzle it; you needed a 600 DPI printer which would cost you 85,000 rupees which was important or you needed a scanner. So just to give you a perspective of the costs, my first 286 costed about Rs 80,000 in 1990 which was a big capital investment and a Maruti 800 car would cost 45000 rupees then. So, you had to make a choice whether you want a have a car or a 286, and my first computer was 286 - 40 MB with 4 MB RAM which was priced this much or likewise getting a fax machine which was primary source of getting information from fund companies. Otherwise you actually tied up with a STD/PCO centre, you gave that number for getting those faxes.So it was fun but trying to prioritise these things, the capital guzzling nature of sourcing information, essential stuff, we didn't have the margin. So, 2000 onwards I had enough resources to think medium term, long term and not to live on a day to day basis and after that it was two sets of people I always come across. The people who are able to enjoy what they are doing here and then there are people who look at it as a job. So, you focus on the people who enjoy and I have many employees. In fact of my current strength, the people who have been with me for 10 years I don't think they even think in terms of..they just like me and we like them.NoneNoneThis actually was a very significant thing in our life. In October 2002, the market was down in the dumps. Market was at 2800 on the Sensex and I designed, devised this magazine. I thought it would be a useful thing. Initially we used to produce something at Value Research which was called mutual fund performance report which was packaged as a research product.It was a set of performance tables, portfolio aggregates and other things and was priced at around Rs 30,000 and we had 15 subscribers of the twenty-five companies which existed then. 15 of the 25 companies used to subscribe. Even companies would find it difficult to subscribe.So, I thought it was a very useful thing. People are able to get a comparative statistics on mutual fund performance which can guide them make a choice. And it was priced at a level where it cannot be democratised. So I thought of packaging it in a manner, because consumers won’t pay Rs 18,000-30000 for a research product which would have a daily update or a weekly update by email or a printed version of a 100 page document and it was useful for almost every investor or every intermediary at least.So, I thought of devising a mechanism of getting that across to people, to intermediaries and investors or mutual fund geeks and getting the price point to Rs 100. So, Rs 100 I was making on cover price. It used to cost around Rs 35-38 to produce the magazine, Rs 20-30 as distributors’ commission. IBH - India Book House was our distributor.So, we still used to make 10-20 rupees and I thought that it because it is going to be an opinionated product on mutual fund and if you have too much advertising, we run the risk of not been looked at as independent and the magazine just took off.We had ready advertisers, every fund company wanted to advertise, every fund company wanted to take the back cover and most fund companies wanted to underwrite that they would like to advertise for years. And when we launched the magazine all I did was I wrote a mail to 30,000 distributors that this magazine has been launched and it might be useful to you and I wrote to all those people who used to write post cards to Value Research seeking some information. So that was our only marketing spend. Writing letters to people who were connected to us, all the business card collected over period in public engagements and other places and we were able to get 10000 subscribers in few months and that was it. Of course, by that time Value Research online was also live, so we could really see the response. We were the first magazine to be a believer of subscription and our first issue onwards we had live subscription available, you could subscribe online and I enabled that and we got ready subscribers. So, this is a very unique magazine. Other magazines - maybe they have to ask both the questions again that are they useful and in the changing context because I find that even we have to re-invent ourselves.I really wonder if my magazine has the same important role as it played back then in 2003, because in 2003 internet was not that democratised. Reliance Jio wasn’t there. You always needed computer to access that information now that is available on the phone. So my magazine for the information, for the data it may not be that relevant. So, we have to change ourselves and we have changed ourselves in a limited way.But I think magazines will lose relevance simply. But because it turns out to be a ready reckoner, all the people who love mutual fund or who like mutual fund or they are involved with mutual fund or make a living they carry it in their briefcase till the next month’s issue replaces it, so it’s simply useful. We have nearly about 95% renewal rate and we have never seen a decline over this period.NoneNoneIt's just that I don't see mutual funds and investing in stocks directly as any conflicting thing. My primary thing is that my long term money should be in equity and I would say that if you have the time, if you have the inclination and if you enjoy doing it then you should be investing in stocks because besides the return, there is the joy of discovering great stock, finding great companies. In the process you learn all about the crooked companies, all the rejections because for all the stocks that we recommend there will be about 15 to 20 stocks which we don’t, but we learn in the process. So, that became interesting. So, I have decided over the next 4 years I will be putting I will be moving 50% off my networth into stocks but in a fairly methodical way. All my portfolio is public disclosure on my website.NoneNoneBut that apart, if you have to choose the funds from fund manager I would say that look at a fund with a five year history, a fund which has been through at least one down cycle and one up cycle and a fund which has done a little better in a down cycle and a little less worse than others in a down cycle and an up cycle, that’s good enough. It’s hard to predict which one will do best, but if a fund manager has demonstrated this in a full market cycle you have hope.NoneNoneSo, it could be one fund, it could be more than one fund if you want to spread your risk but I would say that for most people one fund to five funds will fulfil most of your needs, very complex investment needs because all you need is at best two or three multi-cap funds, one tax saving fund for sake of getting that Rs 150,000 which is your tax exemption limit. You can consider that fund also as you multi-cap allocation and that takes care of it. That apart, one liquid fund for any money which you want it to be on call and any medium-term need, money which you like need to anywhere between 1 to 4 years and you don't want to take chances with that. For example, if your child is getting into college and you want to move a part of equity money into fixed income so you are sure that you are not struggling with that money, not taking any chance with that money, for first year college fee and admission fee, that money should be an ultra-short-term bond fund or a short-term bond fund. So, 3-5 funds can fulfil most people’s needs.NoneNoneThe other reason is need-based. When you need the money you need the money and just take it out and it is important that how you take the money out from any market linked investment because everybody has been told about, do SIP. Nobody has told you that how to take your money out, how long before you need it. So, you do your SIP to reduce the risk of catching the market high, even if you have lump sum money you are definitely going to need lump sum money when you need it if you are planning for a goal.And make sure that you are not dependent on madness of the market for such critical needs. So, do your systematic withdrawal plan, withdraw your money methodically well before you need it because if you are going to depend on the market, markets can be crazy on occasions and it is very likely to be crazy entirely when you need it, going by Moore’s law. So, just be little thoughtful and methodical about averaging things.NoneNoneI have read all the investment books and all the informational stuff but that is more of a need to read because one writes a column and one is looking for interesting ideas and opportunities. Beyond that, very unrelated things, things on psychology or this is one book which I discovered after 15 years of running Value Research which is the ‘Up the Organization’ by Robert Townsend. I wish when I was getting started in 1990, I would have read this. This is one book which I keep on my desk and which I also buy a copy of this for all the line managers because this is a guideline, it is a one page guideline on anything that you do in the business, how to conduct meetings, how to organize party, how to hire, how to advertise, how to write copies. I like this, and this is a very direct book. It very much aligns with my line of thinking that useful, profitable and direct and very straight forward. But then there is lot more to learn. Of late, I have been reading a lot on something like the base camp founders’ book, 37 Signals, things like that and what I enjoy reading of late for couple of years now is history and history of varied kind.NoneNoneNone"

title,Budget 2019: A quick look at where the government spends
datetime,2019-02-06 11:52:00+00:00
description,"In a growing economy, the deficit isn't much of a concern. But bigger the deficit, smaller of the pie that is available to other corporates and individuals to borrow. "
content,"NoneAs individuals, we go into debt basically for two reasons. One is when we wish to acquire a capital asset that cannot be acquired by our savings alone. Second is when our income cannot meet our expenditure.In the earlier days, one used to take a loan only for large assets such as house. These days, thanks to easy finance, one is attracted to go into debt for even smaller assets such as mobile phones. Why buy an entry level smart phone when you can get easy finance that can make that expensive smart phone seem much more affordable?The government does the same. It spends money on capital assets that are productive and worthwhile taking debt on, while also spending humongous money for spending on what are basically trinkets.NoneIn other words, to make the ends meet, the government will need to borrow the difference of Rs 7.05 lakh crore or thereabouts. In simple terms, for every 1 rupee the government earns, it shall spend 1 rupee and 35 paise.The borrowing is done by issuing government treasury bonds which are purchased primarily by banks and other institutions. Some of the savings we place in banks go towards buying these bonds and hence in a way the government returns some of the money it collects from us as taxes come back to us as interest.In a growing economy, the deficit isn't much of a concern. But bigger the deficit, smaller of the pie that is available to other corporates and individuals to borrow and one which in its own way forces cost of borrowing to rise for everyone.So, where does the government spend all that money and more? Let's take a look at its major spending items.The Interest is interestingThe biggest item on the agenda and one that makes up nearly 24 percent of its expenditure – Interest it pays on current loans. If you calculate that as percentage of revenue receipt, it comes to 32 percent of its income.Whoa, you may think, that's is a bloody big number and it surely is. But as long as the economy grows and revenues keep growing, this is still very much under control. The problem starts when the economy slows and interest payments start to eat up much of the revenue leaving little for investing for the future. Thankfully, we aren't there, so lets move ahead.Also, if the RBI cuts interest rates it can ease the load for future loans, and ensuring low inflation is one way to nudge the RBI to cut rates.Big OthersThe next biggest expenditure is from Defence (Rs 3 lakh crore) which consumes 11 percent of the total expected expenditure. While this may appear large, for a country of our size and not really friendly neighbours, this as a percentage of the GDP is actually small.The third biggest outlay is for food subsidy (Rs 1.8 lakh crore). India provides food subsidy directly and in-directly. The expenditure for such is borne by both the Centre and the states. Food subsidy is partly targeted at farmers from whom we buy at higher than market prices (for some cereals) and partly targeted at poorer sections of the society by providing it at low cost. In other words, this is welfare and something that cannot easily decrease.Pension takes up 6.26 percent of our expenses (more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore) and this is a major number for with growing wages and longer life expectancy, the path forward looks higher. However, this is pensions for government workers, and since 2004 all government workers have moved to the NPS where the return is investment linked, so the impact may reduce after the next three decades. In this budget, government has announced a pension scheme for unorganised sector where in workers shall get Rs 3,000 after retirement.The details of this scheme which will see implementation by the next government can be a pretty big dent for much of Indian Industry comes under the unorganized sector. Pensions have brought down some of the largest corporates in history, will governments be any better? Well we need to hold our views and see how this gets implemented and the cost of such implementation. (Image source: Capitalmind)The author is Head of Compliance at capitalmind.in"

description,"Investors need to go beyond individual stock/fund returns and start focusing on risk allocation, costs and returns to get an idea on the real performance of your overall wealth."
content,"Mrin AgarwalHave you given a thought to your overall portfolio performance? Or looked at the factors that affect the portfolio return?I so often come across people talking about individual stocks or funds, but when quizzed about their overall portfolio return they have no idea. In my sessions in 2018, the most discussed topics were:3. Why choose an advisor, we can go direct to save costsTypically, I have noticed that investors tend to track investments that probably constitute only 5-10% of their portfolio and do not give a thought to the balance investments. The issue with tracking a few stocks or a few funds is that one may not be optimizing other investments. There is no point in concentrating only on the 5% invested in stocks and have 95% invested in traditional investments that do not even beat inflation.Investors need to go beyond individual stock/fund returns and start focusing on the following metrics to get an idea on the real performance of your overall wealth.Risk AllocationNoneCostsNoneReturnsNoneComputing the overall portfolio return, costs and risk allocation is a good start to determine changes to be made to your portfolio to make your money work better for you."

title,Struggling to save money? These 5 tips may help millennials achieve the goal
datetime,2019-02-05 14:22:00+00:00
description,Saving money is extremely important if you are planning for future goals. Living on pay check to pay check each month isn't sustainable beyond a point.
content,"Anil RegoOne of the main grouses that many in the new generation have is that there isn’t enough money to save. Beyond the noise is the sober fact that saving money requires as much effort, if not more, as earning it.The entire ecosystem around us is about consumption. There are tonnes of offers promising 'buy two get three', attractive 50 percent discounts and 'shop till you drop'. It is quite difficult to say no to such offers if you have worked very hard.But, saving money is extremely important if you are planning for future goals. Living on paycheck to paycheck each month isn't sustainable beyond a point. Hence, it is important to use effective tricks so that you can conserve your hard-earned money.Scan six-months of expenses and target where you can cut costsYou can adopt one out of two ways to save more. You either earn more or spend less. Earning more isn’t as easy as watching a movie on Netflix. So, automatically the onus is spending less.Looking at just one month and saving money isn’t doable. You have to look at six months of expenses pattern and find out where you can cut flab. This is a useful exercise especially for those who spend via debit or credit cards. Just pull up 5-6 months of monthly statements and voila! You can find out unnecessary costs.NoneAdd your 'personal tax' on every paycheckHave you seen how easily people fork up money for taxes, but if you ask them for help all they give is a frown. Our next saving trick is all about playing tax-man. The best part of the trick is that you can keep the taxes to yourself.Here is what you need to do: Deduct 10 percent tax on your monthly take-home pay. For instance, if you earn Rs 30,000 per month, deduct 10 percent tax or Rs 3,000.If you save Rs 3,000 per month and save it in a recurring deposit or a mutual fund, at the end of 12 months you can net a cool 6-8 percent return.Why do we ask you to invest? This is because if you just keep it lying in your simple savings account or in cash, there is a high chance the money will be spent. This is not just a millennial issue. Idle money always gets spent. There is always some unplanned trip or some impulsive purchase, which will eat up your 'tax money'.Use an automatic account for hands-free investingHave you seen how driverless cars move? Yes, it is a technological marvel. When we take out the manual intervention out of anything, certain habits are easier to maintain. This is why things that are automatic work so well. Be it a geyser with an automatic heat sensor, or a toaster that pops up piping-hot bread, or the utilitarian microwave, life was never so easy.Millennials can make saving hands-free too. By doing a one-time setup and giving instructions to your bank, automatic investing brings the best of the world at your feet.NoneNoneEventually, you might get a raise, but that will always be small. The only way to make serious amount of extra money is by doing another gig. Yes, that’s right. When you are good at two-three things, it is time to multi-task.The side hustle may not be something as exotic as building rockets, doing accountancy or making the next best-selling novel. It has to be a simple job that you can do for fixed hours a week and get paid.Easy examples can be being a babysitter for pets, looking after administration at a neighbourhood club, or even arranging help for rich/old people who would pay you.The point is a small extra source of income will ensure that you are better-placed savings wise, and your financial prudence will guarantee that extra money isn’t spent. Do not underestimate the power of small incomes. They pack quite a punch when you save.Embrace the sharing economyWhen people do an activity together, it can save money. Seriously, it can save money if you plan and execute group buying well. Everything right from daily travel, sharing an online streaming account, making lunches for colleagues (instead of buying them at an eatery)—the list is endless.Businesses operating around us have one goal: to sell more while keeping their cost of sales low. That is possible when many people come together and spend at the same time. This can be quite a savings trigger. Because you and your pals will time purchases together, each one of you can get discounts. This will help you save lots of money.The sharing economy is built for millennials. Studies show that millennials don’t mind sharing as long as the experience remains good. Today, services, apps and internet allow people to embrace the sharing economy like never before. While things like carpooling existed earlier too, today the pooling happens across a range of products and services.So, sit back, enjoy the fruits of sharing economy and start making that cash register tinkle with every activity. Share, save and repeat."

The tie will be the first of three 'El Classicos', which will be held in the span of 25 days. Real Madrid host the reverse of this fixture on February 27 and both teams will then square off in a La Liga tie on March 2.The last time that these two teams met was in an October La Liga fixture with Barcelona emerging 5-1 winners at the Camp Nou. Luis Suarez was the hero in that fixture as he scored a hat-trick while Messi was sidelined with a broken arm. That match cost then Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui his job and since then the Galacticos are a very different side under Santiago Solari.Madrid come into this game on the back of their best run of form in nearly a year. They have won five successive games in all competitions and an away goal could be vital for them heading into the reverse fixture.Barcelona have enjoyed great success in the Copa Del Rey winning the past four finals to take their overall tally of trophies in this competition to a record 30. Real are third on the list of all-time winners in the competition having lifted the trophy on 19 occasions. The Galacticos will be eager to reduce the gap between them and their rivals especially since their last triumph in the tournament came back in 2014.Barcelona continue to sweat over the fitness of Lionel Messi, the all-time leading scorer in El Classico history, who suffered a thigh strain in their 2-2 draw against Valencia.

It's the same with Messi.""Real Madrid coach Solari has expressed hope that Messi is able to participate in the first leg for the good of the game. Solari has said that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's presence will not affect his preparations for the tie as he prepares for a full-strength Barcelona attack.Team NewsFrench winger Ousmane Dembele will miss this game as he continues to focus on his fitness since recovering from a hamstring injury. Messi will most likely make the squad but whether he will start depends on the pre-match assessment.Barcelona will also be without Rafinha, Samuel Umtiti and Jasper Cillessen due to injury.Solari will have a fully fit squad to pick from except for young Spanish defender Jesus Vallejo who is out with a muscular issue.NoneNoneNonePlayers to watch out for:Luis SuarezNoneThe last time these two teams met was in the La Liga where Suarez scored a hat-trick to condemn Madrid to a 5-1 defeat.

At least 23 people died in the crash, including eight players from that squad. Sixty-one years later, the people of Manchester still observe a moment of silence at 15.04 on this fateful day to remember their fallen heroes.After their 3-3 draw against Red Star Belgrade in Yugoslavia, which also secured their progression to the European Cup semi-finals, the team was set to fly back to England with a stopover at Munich to refuel when tragedy struck. That squad was fondly called ‘Busby Babes’ after their manager Matt Busby and was one of the most successful teams of that decade.The aircraft, an Airspeed Ambassador 2, reached Munich safely but faced issues after refuelling. The pilots attempted two failed take-offs which were aborted due to engine issues. By the time the aircraft was ready for a third attempt, heavy snowfall meant that the runway was covered in slush. The slush prevented the plane from reaching the speed required for take-off and with not enough runway left to abort take-off, the flight crashed into a nearby house causing an explosion.The crash claimed the lives of Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Liam Whelan — all part of the squad.

The front suspension for instance, unlike the upside down forks in Indonesia, the India-spec MT-15 gets conventional telescopic suspension. The rear swingarm too is a box section, unlike the R15's cast-aluminium swingarm.With a wheelbase of 1,355 mm, the bike stands at 2,020 mm in length, 800 mm in width and 1,070 mm in height.

title,Inox Leisure shines in Q3 FY19 over strong ad and F&B revenues
datetime,2019-02-19 14:10:00+00:00
description,During the current financial year Inox added 68 screens across 14 properties.
content,"NoneSpeaking to Moneycontrol, Alok Tandon, CEO, Inox Leisure, said, “Spend per head has increased (year-on-year) YoY from Q3 by nearly 6 percent to Rs 74 per head. Advertisement revenue is also another major stream and we have had the highest ad revenue growth in the industry in the last seven quarters.”Advertising revenue surged to Rs 55.9 crore YoY, a 38 percent jump from the previous quarter that was fueled by a higher per screen realization. Tandon also said that the company's nine-month revenue for advertising stood at Rs 133.5 crore.Listing the reasons for the growth, Tandon said,“We have targeted new clients, created new concepts and solutions for media planners, and we have also used the multiplex's real estate, like the lobby, for a more impactful visibility of our clients’ products.”Along with advertising, food and beverages (F&B) is an important component for Inox. The company's F&B revenue grew 45 percent YoY to Rs 106 crore on the back of an increased footfall, and the benefits from the lowering of goods and services tax (GST) levied on food and beverages served in multiplexes from 18 percent to 5 percent.Brokerage firm Elara Capital pointed out that the spend per head (SPH) growth was despite the discounts and promotions offered even after the public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the Bombay High Court (HC) that challenged the current practice of multiplexes prohibiting customers bringing in and consuming food and beverages from outside sources within their properties.Inox has introduced an interactive self-help kiosk in the lobby and it has also got a food icon embedded in its app which lets guests to order food from wherever they are standing.NoneHe added that today’s audiences have become discerning, and want a good story. “For us Indians, what’s important now is that the content should be good, and we have seen it improving in the last two-three years.”For Inox, the top 5 films in Q3 FY19 accounted for about 45 percent of gross box office collection (GBOC), compared to 52 percent in the corresponding quarter last year. This showed an increasing dependence on small and medium budget movies for generating footfall.NoneNoneInox’s net box office revenue grew 29 percent YoY to Rs 243 crore, led by a footfall growth of 25 percent YoY. According to Elara Capital, this was despite the negative impact of BookMyShow's (BMS) deal renewal with rival PVR for the booking and selling its ticketing inventory through web and app based platforms for three years.For Inox, the average ticket price (ATP) grew 3.6 percent YoY to Rs 206. This was on the lower side over the lackluster performance of big-ticket films commanding a premium ATP.NoneIn the third quarter, the company added 17 screens across 3 properties. “In January alone we have added 2 properties with 11 screens and for the remaining quarter, our endeavor is to add two more properties with 13 screens and close the year with 81 screen count. Today we already have 557 screens in 67 cities in 136 multiplexes,” said Tandon.NoneThe government’s cut GST rates from 28 percent to 18 percent on movie tickets priced above Rs 100, and from 18 percent to 12 percent on movie tickets priced below Rs 100 has also proved beneficial for the companu.“We at Inox have passed on the entire benefit of the tax reduction to our customers and this will surely help in increasing the box office sales as more people will come to theatres. This is a very positive sign and will add to the entire industry growing in India,”Tandon said.NoneThe brokerage firm also noted that Inox has the potential to grow further over better realizations on an improved brand image and consistent execution."

title,"A new way to start SIP in mutual fund, SmartSIP by FundsIndia: Is it really smart?"
datetime,2019-02-05 08:31:00+00:00
description,"Unlike value averaging SIPs, the SmartSIP will keep the monthly amount constant, but will allocate between equity and debt based on market conditions."
content,"One disadvantage in a mutual fund's systematic plan is that it channels a fixed sum of your money into equity markets, irrespective of where the markets are. Whether the markets are high or low, you end up investing the same sum of money, every month. Although you buy more units in rising markets and less units in falling markets, the monthly investment amount remains the same. How about investing more money when markets are down and less money when markets are up?What is this?FundsIndia has launched a new SIP tool called FundsIndia SmartSIP that allows you to do just that. It has tied up with Franklin Templeton Asset Management Co for this program. The way it works is this. It will invest your proceeds in two of Templeton's schemes, Franklin India Equity Fund (FIEF; formerly Franklin India Prima Plus;) which is an equity fund and Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund (FIUS); a debt fund.The fund house has devised a criteria with multiple factors, like price to equity ratio, price to book ratio, return on equity, cash flows and so on, that will ascertain how much money should be invested in the equity fund. The rest automatically goes to the debt fund. The model will start by allocating 70 percent in FIEF and 30 percent in FIUS. Thereafter, the allocation will change as per the model that Franklin Templeton has laid out for FundsIndia’s SmartSIP.Already, there are variants of SIPs that look at markets more actively and decide how much more or less money needs to be invested in specific months, depending on how the markets are at the moment. For instance, some online distributors run variants of SIPs that allow people to increase or decrease their monthly commitments.Fundsndia.com has its own version of a value averaging SIP where you get to set your return expectations at the start of the SIP. Then, every month Fundsindia.com calculates how much money you have made so far and whether you are on course to earn the targeted return. If you aren’t, then the Value averaging SIP puts more money every month. “But it’s not a very scientific way of reaching your goal. Since investors get to decide a target return, many times we have noticed that investors enter an unrealistic figure (in percentage). Such expectations could be outrageous and based on recent events”, says Vidya Bala, Head of mutual fund research, Fundsindia.What works?Even though the fund house’s algorithms will decide how much money needs to be invested in an equity fund periodically, your monthly outgo will remain the same. Unlike Value SIPs and other sophisticated SIP programs where the investment amount changes every month, the SmartSIP’s monthly allocation remains the same. It does so because it follows an asset allocation approach. Whatever money needs to be deployed in the equity fund changes every month, the rest automatically goes into the debt fund.""The debt fund is not meant to be a parking ground. Our debt scheme here is the closest among Templeton’s basket of funds that gives you fixed deposit plus returns. The debt fund here is not meant to take any duration calls,"" says Bala.The bottom-line: Does SmartSIP earn you better returns? Bala says it does. FundsIndia did back-testing with Franklin Templeton’s model of allocating money into these two schemes over the past 10 year period. The tenure for each of the investment made was five years. Bala said the SmartSIP’s returns were 1.6% more than a normal SIP that invests 70% in FIEF and 30% in FIUS at all times, across seventy-two 5-year return periods it considered over the span of 10 years.What doesn’t?Bala tells us that SmartSIP came up from the feedback that FundsIndia got from many individuals who invest in mutual funds through the platform. She said that while a typical investor looks to invest a steady amount every month, there are some investors who like to time the market.It’s okay to be active in equity markets, but market timing is a bad thing. While FundsIndia has done its due diligence and has zeroed in on a fund house whose model it found to be best from among a few other fund houses’ it considered, there’s no guarantee that SmartSIP will continue to outperform a plain-vanilla 70:30 SIP.This product is only to FundsIndia’s customers. This is an exclusive arrangement between Franklin Templeton and FundsIndia. You need to open an account with FundsIndia and can then avail of this facility. Even if you do that- and given the way that you need to have about 6-8 schemes in your portfolio- SmartSIP is ideally just one of the SIPs. You cannot even go to Franklin Templeton directly and opt for this option because SmartSIP is a feature on FundsIndia.Also, FundsIndia does not offer direct plans. Since it is an online distributor, the SmartSIP is through regular plans even though the SIP is automated and it doesn’t do much. To be sure, FundsIndia does not charge any extra cost for SmartSIP.What should you do?Unless you are a customer of FundsIndia, it doesn’t make much sense to open an account with a portal just to be able to start a SmartSIP, especially since SmartSIP is just one product you will have in your portfolio. Though to be fair, FundsIndia is as good a platform as any, in terms of ease and convenience to help you invest in MFs.Then again, there are few other platforms such as Mutual Funds Utility that allow you to invest in direct plans. Your choice of platforms should depend on the features they offer and the costs they charge."

content,"Vehicles have become an indispensable part of people's lives, be it for commercial or personal uses. While some have a distinct idea of what their preferences are, some find the difference between petrol and diesel engines confusing. For those planning to opt for a petrol vehicle in the future, you may need to know what you stand to gain or lose.Pros:A petrol engine packs a powerful punch in a small size. Unlike diesel engines, petrol engines can be tuned to make more power without the use of a turbocharger.Petrol engines also have cheaper parts, making after-sales services rather affordable. Also, because most customers opt for petrol variants, parts are easily available.Petrol engines are also quieter and smoother than their diesel alternatives. They also tend to emit lesser pollutants if maintained well.Cons:Petrol is expensive when compared to diesel and adds to the running cost of the car over the years. Also, because of the volatility of petrol, mileage of the car also suffers.Petrol engines tend to clog up quickly and require maintenance more frequently. If not serviced regularly, petrol engines can deteriorate faster than their diesel counterparts."

description,The airline has gone back to the model when it recently added its ATR fleet
content,"NoneTill 2017, the airline had championed the sale and leaseback model. But that year, it switched to buying aircraft and owning them to bring down ownership cost and counter rising lease rentals.However, in an indication of squeezed margins, the airline has been forced to go back to the old model. Chief Financial Officer Rohit Philip said IndiGo has used the sale and leaseback model for the recent two additions in its fleet of ATR aircraft.The airline now has a fleet of 14 ATRs. Of these, the first 12 were bought as cash purchases.""During the periods of uncertainty, it is always prudent for airlines to manage cash carefully. So we decided to finance the next tranche of five airplane through an operating lease, and then we make a case-by-case basis beyond that,"" said Philip. He said the airline will be using the sale and leaseback model for the next three ATRs too.At the same time, the IndiGo CFO reiterated this was a temporary measure to preserve the cash.In a sale and leaseback model, an airline buys an aircraft, sells it to a lessor and then leases the plane back. The model helps conserve cash, and also keeps airline books debt free.The changeIn 2017, the airline industry was enjoying healthy margins, thanks to cheap fuel. IndiGo could dip into its cash reserves to buy aircraft and keep them.Cash purchases also helped counter lease rentals that were going skywards.  This was especially true for the new A320neos.  ""On a net basis, there is differences in Ceos and Neos, especially when you talk about older planes. You will have low lease rentals. Especially, the used planes that we have, have low lease rentals but higher maintenance costs, higher fuel burn,"" said Philip.The Ceos are the earlier generation A320 aircraft.Philip added: ""Neos might have slightly higher rentals but lower maintenance costs and lower fuel burn.""Higher costsCircumstances changed last year when a record increase in crude rates saw most of the airlines, including IndiGo, bleeding. The airline, which has the highest market share in the domestic aviation industry, reported its first quarterly loss since listing on the BSE in the second quarter of the current financial year.In the third quarter, an improved other income helped the low budget carrier keep its book in the black.The airline has the most aggressive fleet expansion plan, among its Indian peers. In the third quarter, IndiGo added 19 aircraft to its fleet, which now has 208 planes. Of these, 29 are owned by the company and the rest is on the sale and leaseback model.The carrier has also increased the number of dollar-denominated leases."

Gandhi almost only tweets about politics, unlike the PM who uses it for other purposes too, and talks about issues like unemployment and lacunae in other parties – just what voters care for.NO ONE KILLED...Haren Pandya.Tulsiram Prajapati.Justice Loya.Prakash Thombre.Shrikant Khandalkar.Kauser Bi.Sohrabuddin Shiekh.THEY JUST DIED.None"

description,LIC will be required to eventually bring down its stake in IDBI Bank from 51 percent to 15 percent
content,"NoneInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had in June 2018 made an exception when it allowed LIC to hold 51 percent in IDBI Bank. Insurance regulations state an insurer can hold only 15 percent equity stake in an entity to ensure there is no concentration of risks.In January 2019, LIC completed the deal with IDBI Bank. However, IRDAI Chairman Subhash Chandra Khuntia told reporters on the sidelines of an event last week that the approval for the LIC-IDBI Bank deal had been on the condition that the stake will eventually be brought down to 15 percent.IDBI Bank board had on February 4 approved a proposal to change its name subject to a ‘no objection’ from Reserve Bank of India, shareholders as well as name availability by Ministry of Corporate Affairs.While IRDAI has not specified by when LIC will have to bring down its stake in IDBI Bank, it is understood it will take at least four to five years. Whether it will be brought down gradually or at once is to be seen.With IDBI Bank, this is LIC’s foray into the banking sector. Their idea will be to expand operations and engage in a full-fledged banking business. The mandate of reducing stake to 15 percent in the future could be a dampener in their plans.Also, if the name has been changed after the majority stake purchase by LIC, once they reduce the stake will the name be changed again?IDBI Bank and turnaroundLIC’s first mission is to help IDBI Bank manage its losses and also offer support to the bank against non-performing assets. IDBI Bank's third quarter loss widened sharply to Rs 4,185 crore, nearly a three-fold increase compared to a loss of Rs 1,524 crore posted a year-ago due to higher provisions.Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, fell by 18.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,357 crore in the quarter ended December 2018 with 17 percent degrowth in loans.However, their gross non-performing assets (NPA) as a percentage of total assets declined to 29.67 percent in Q3 against 31.78 percent in Q2FY19 and net NPA also dropped to 14.01 percent against 17.30 percent sequentially."

As capital expenditure is seen picking up, more companies are expected to borrow from banks and bank credit is expected to pick up. CRISIL estimates bank credit to grow at 13% to 14% over fiscal years 2019 and 2020 as compared to 8% in fiscal year 2018. This will force bank to mobilise more deposits. According to CRISIL banks will need to raise at least Rs 19-20 lakh crore of fresh deposits until March 2020 to keep the credit-deposit ratio near 80%, which in itself would be highest in a decade. Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director – CRISIL Ratings said: ""Deposit growth is lagging credit growth. To continue lending the banks need to mobilise money which will ensure that banks continue to offer attractive interest rates on fixed deposits.""NoneIf you are looking to invest in one single fixed deposit with public sector bank where retail card rates are higher than bulk FD rates, then you need not stop at Rs 1 crore.

Around 5 per cent of our total customers in India is women.""Agarwal said Lamborghini India has started taking orders for the Huracan Evo and the waiting period for deliveries will be around six months.""It will start reaching the market in May or June,"" he said.With the launch of Evo, which is the next level of evolution of the Huracan family, he said, ""All the current range in the Huracan family will stop production in the next few months."""

content,"Oppo is continuing the on-going budget smartphone trend in India with the impressive K1. Priced at Rs 16,990, the Oppo K1 is aimed at India's entry-level mid-range smartphone market. The Oppo K1 will likely go head-to-head with Xiaomi’s Redmi and Samsung M series range of smartphones.Oppo K1 PerformanceUnder the hood the K1 houses a Snapdragon 660 octa-core processor paired with an Adreno 512 GPU, 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage space. The addition of Hyper Boost technology combined with the impressive spec sheet and you get a phone capable of delivering an optimised gaming experience. The 3,500mAh battery that powers the Oppo K1 should give you more than enough juice to last the whole day.Oppo K1 DesignEverything about the K1 – from the body to finish – looks and feels premium. The glass back coupled with the gradient texture finish make the K1 look more like a flagship than an entry-level mid-tier smartphone. The K1 features a thin, compact and extremely lightweight construction, making it easy to handle.Oppo K1 DisplayThe Oppo K1 sports a gorgeous 6.4-inch full HD+(1080 x 2340 pixels) AMOLED display. Furthermore, the screen boasts a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, 402ppi pixel density and peak brightness of 430 nits to combine for an incredible viewing experience. Oppo has adapted the water-drop notch on the K1, which is a little disappointing considering 2019 marks the year of the punch-hole display. However, the K1 still retains an impressive 91 per cent screen-to-body ratio. The screen cleverly hides an in-display fingerprint scanner that functions comparatively quickly.Oppo K1 CameraThe K1’s dual rear camera setup consists of a 16-megapixel primary sensor and 2MP secondary sensor with an LED flash module. The 25-megapixel AI-backed camera on the front is pretty capable and can accurately capture 296 feature points on your face.

But under the ESG framework, it's about all stakeholders - shareholders, employees, regulators, suppliers and customers. When you do an analysis of a company based on this, you are capturing the risk factors; and at the same time, looking at opportunities that may not reflect in valuation done the traditional way,"" he added.The Fund has tied up with Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), an independent rankings advisor, who has put in place a ranking framework covering ESG principles.""We have looked at several reporting guidelines.

datetime,2019-02-06 14:03:00+00:00
description,None
content,"NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneKey Q3 positives- Topline growth of 21 percent was driven by strong volume growth. The decorative volume growth estimates for the quarter stood at nearly 14 percent as strong consumer demand during the festive season along with a favourable base (timing of Diwali) aided the sales growth in October-December period.- Operating profit margins recovered sequentially with successive price hikes partially alleviating the crude-oil and currency-related pressures. However, high-cost inventory kept margins under pressure on YoY basis.- Apart from strong demand in the decorative business, there was decent traction in industrials, Nepal decorative business, and Saboo Coatings.- The management expects a recovery in Q4 margins from softening crude prices and rupee stabilisation against the dollar.Key Q3 Negatives- Gross margins in industrial segment contracted over 400 bps to below 38 percent hitting multi-quarter low. Margins in this segment are lower versus the decorative business. However, the contraction was mostly due to delayed price hikes, high competition and lower pricing power.- The competitive intensity remains high and could increase further as Asian Paints nears completion of its two new plants at Vizag and Mysuru. The plants will add six million kilo litre capacity to the sector and could put a cap on the pricing power of the industry for the near term.- The demand for automotive business could taper as the outlook remains weak and the slowdown is expected to persist for at least 2-3 quarters.Outlook- The management is optimistic on demand in coming months and confident that recent price hikes will ease off margin pressures.None- At 47 times FY20 price-earnings multiple, the valuation multiple of Berger (CMP: 307, market cap: 29,848 crores) seems in line with that of FMCG front-runners and the sector leader Asian Paints. The current valuation seems to factor in near term positives and offers limited upside from current levels.Follow @Sach_Pal"

EBITDA per tonne (Rs 15,885 per tonne) has improved by 23 percent on YoY basis. Sequentially, as well there was an uptick due to higher share of value added products, better realisations on SNF (Sulfonated Naphthalene Formaldehyde) and higher share of Carbon black.As guided, company has completed the debottlenecking of coal tar distillation capacity in Q3 FY19. This provides an incremental capacity of 1 lakh tonne leading to 25 percent capacity addition in this segment. While the legacy capacity is optimally utilised, company expects a gradual ramp up in utilisation (peak utilisation in next two years) of new capacity as and when aluminum industry prospects improve.Chart: EBITDA per tonne trajectoryNoneKey negativeLower production volume (83,571 tonne) was the key drag this quarter. However, 9 percent sequential decline was mainly on account of planned shutdown (CTP plant) for the capacity expansion. In the near term, sales volumes are expected to rebound to the levels witnessed in Q2 FY19.ObservationsCompany is on course to set up 20,000 tons (currently 600 tons) capacity for advance carbon material (ACM), in West Bengal, to be used for lithium ion batteries. This capacity would be available for production in phases starting from H1 FY20 over the next 12 months.In case of Carbon black, 60,000 tons of additional capacity (currently: 1.2 lakh tons) of specialty carbon black having a non-rubber application would be available by H1 FY20. In the first year, company is expecting more than 50 percent utilisation of the capacity. Peak utilisation is expected in next three years with a revenue potential of Rs 750 crore.On the balance sheet front, there is a steady improvement. Compared to March’18, net debt has reduced by Rs 96 crore which takes the net debt/equity to 0.32x vs. 0.43x earlier. It needs to be that ongoing capex programmes are funded through internal accruals.OutlookOn a medium term, volume growth is expected to come from both the key streams of revenue – CTP and Carbon black due to new capacities. However, capacity utilisation ramp up is expected to be gradual in light of softness in end markets. Further, while price realisations have eased, the company is positive on ability to defend operating margins.Additionally, higher contribution from advance carbon material and higher utilisation of Sulfonated Naphthalene Formaldehyde (imposition of anti-dumping duty) are expected to be supportive for the margin profile.Based on quarterly update and end market prospects, we have made a downward adjustment in our expectations and project EBITDA CAGR of 20 percent (FY18-20e). On account of this stock is trading at a trading multiple of 11.9x FY20 estimated earnings. In our view, the stock can be accumulated in a staggered manner for a long-term haul as the company is well positioned to capture pickup in demand trends later this year.None"

title,Tax guide for YouTube bloggers: Here's how to determine your income tax liabilities 
datetime,2019-02-06 09:39:00+00:00
description,"You will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless you register your business as a company, LLP or Partnership Company"
content,"Archit GuptaThe recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new profession—video blogging—more popularly called as vlogging. YouTube is its main medium. Many of you might be ardent followers of such YouTubers who give quirky life lessons, offer fashion tips, review books or movies or just repost clips from popular movies among others. India can now boast of its own YouTube stars with millions of subscribers.Several budding vloggers, who make a mint by uploading popular videos (ideated by self or from credited sources), are uncertain about their tax implications. Let us explore this in detail. Before getting into tax rules for YouTubers, it is important to determine the source of income of such vloggers.Nature of income of YouTubersOne aspect that attracts entrepreneurial minds to vlogging is that there are no age constraints and everything you make will be owned by you. It doesn’t require a lot of investment. Many YouTubers have started with uploading videos shot on their mobile phones. Many even keep their regular jobs until they get a breakthrough. Here are the kinds of income made by YouTubers.-Affiliate sales or other freelance income from YouTubeTax Implications for Income from YouTubeNoneBeing a service sector business, the assesses can only opt for normal provisions under the Income Tax Act,1961. If the gross total income exceeds Rs 1 crore, then section 44AB i.e., tax audit will be applicable to the YouTuber. Additionally, Tax Deducted at Source(TDS) provisions will also be applicable to you on every receipt of payment. You can view your TDS amount through 26AS, which can be generated electronically.If your gross turnover is below Rs 1 crore, then you have to follow the normal tax provisions to calculate taxes and maintain books of accounts. But if your gross total income exceeds Rs 1 crore, you must follow all bookkeeping requirements under Rule 6A and get your accounts audited by a Chartered Accountant(CA) under section 44AB of Income Tax Act,1961. You will have to pay taxes on the net taxable income after considering all the business expenses and depreciation as per the income tax slab applicable to you.You may also have to pay advance tax if your total tax liability is more than Rs 10,000 in a financial year. You have to pay advance tax in four instalments given your tax liability is more than Rs 10,000 in a financial y year (FY).Starting from June 15 , 15 percent of the advance tax has to be paid. Then by September 15, you should have paid 45 percent, by December,  75 percent of the advance tax liability and by March 15, 100 percent of it.You have to pay your advance tax liabilities by the due date after considering the amount of TDS that has been already deducted from payments made to you. This TDS can be cross-checked from Form 26AS.Don’t forget to claim the below expensesNoneNoneNoneIn case you have calculated your taxes under normal provisions and tax audit does not apply i.e., your gross total income is less than Rs 1 crore, you will have to file your income tax return by July 31 of the assessment year. For assesses who are subject to tax audit, the return filing deadline is usually September 30 of the assessment year."

title,Comment | Tata Motors runs headlong into the Great Wall of China
datetime,2019-02-08 14:52:00+00:00
description,"Brexit, US tariffs, investments in future technologies, excess capacity and high cost structure are taking their toll on JLR."
content,"There is a saying among market veterans that Tata group firms are sound companies to lend to, but not to buy shares in. After Friday’s 20 percent drop in Tata Motor shares, said market veterans must be smiling smugly. The stock was battered by as much as 22.4 percent in early trade before recovering a bit. Analysts are falling over themselves to downgrade the stock or cut target prices after its record loss in the December quarter. There can be no two views that medium term prospects for Tata Motors are as bleak as a picnic in the Gobi desert.The firm is facing a perfect storm. Chinese sales have fallen off the cliff, its bet on diesel has gone wrong, it has to accelerate investments to get its product and technology mix right, all this while keeping costs from spiralling. Rating agency warnings and unhappy bond holders means that debt costs are rising; the yield on Jaguar’s 4.5 percent bond maturing in 2027 is close to 9 percent.Tata Motors hopes that taking an impairment of 3.1 billion pounds at JLR in the December quarter will help cut costs. It will save 300 million pounds in amortisation and depreciation costs. But that may not be enough. The company itself has indicated that free cash flow will be negative for at least five quarters. That’s not surprising given its 12 billion pound capex programme over three years. JLR won’t do much to improve cashflows. Indeed, its management has cut its EBIT margin guidance to 3-6 percent from fiscal years 2020-2022 compared to 4-7 percent earlier.A big part of the disappointment is owing to the slowdown in China. In the December quarter, retail sales fell 47 percent in China. In January 2019, they declined almost 40 percent. To be fair to JLR and Tata Motors, the China market has been tough. Auto sales fell for the first time in two decades in 2018. So, JLR has not been alone. Apple Inc said earlier this month that it would miss its sales target for the December quarter by at least $5 billion. According to the Nikkei Asian Review, nine-month net profits for Japanese companies with heavy exposure to China fell 8 percent year-on-year compared to a 2.9 percent drop for all Japanese listed firms.A second factor of course is that globally most automakers are having a tough time. There is a technological disruption in the industry – electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, self-driving cars etc – that is prompting huge investments and reduced profit forecasts.NoneThe excess capacity and aggressive investments in future technologies has led to an unsustainable cost structure. The Project Charge programme to reduce 2.5 billion pounds in costs is just the first step. But a big question remains as to how much returns will its investments bring? Remember, the 3.1-billion pound writedown also included research and development investments. The immediate focus of the management should be on how to up the ante in China, the world’s largest market. The current turnaround action plan of cutting dealer stock and inventory, and giving additional support to dealers doesn’t inspire much confidence."

title,SC asks Mayawati to return public money spent on statues: What is the Memorial scam case?

description,"The Mayawati government had constructed statues, memorials and parks in various parts of Uttar Pradesh  at a total cost of Rs 2,600 crore"
content,"NoneAlthough the matter was posted for final hearing on April 2, the bench was of the tentative view that “Mayawati has to deposit the public money spent on her statues and party symbol to the state exchequer”.This was in response to a petition filed by an advocate who had contended that public money cannot be used to construct one’s own statues and further propaganda.Let’s take a closer look at what the case is and how much money does Mayawati owe the public exchequer.What is the case?Mayawati was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh from May 2007 to March 2012. During this time, she is known to have constructed multiple Dalit memorials, including statues of BSP founder Kanshi Ram and BSP’s election symbol, an elephant.NoneThe UP Vigilance Department alleged that the construction of these statues had led to “a loss of over Rs 111, 44, 35, 066 to the government exchequer and unlawful gain to public servants and private individuals”, something that later came to be known as the ‘Memorial Scam’.Where is the money?The Mayawati government had constructed statues, memorials and parks in various parts of Uttar Pradesh, including Noida and Lucknow, at a total cost of Rs 2,600 crore.In May 2013, the UP Lokayukta alleged that Rs 1,400 crore of public money has been siphoned off in the construction of these memorials. The Lokayukta pointed out that this was 34 percent of the budget for the construction of memorials and parks.Who all were named in this scam?NoneWhat is the progress on the case so far?NoneHowever, Mehrotra had told reporters that there was no proof of Mayawati’s personal involvement in the scam.In September 2018, the Allahabad High Court had sought a status report from the UP Vigilance Department."

title,Vivo V15 Pro with 32MP AI pop-up camera to launch on February 20: Everything we know so far

description,The Vivo V15 Pro will be the first smartphone ever to feature a 32-megapixel pop-up selfie camera.
content,"Vivo is reviving the pop-up front camera trend – first adopted on the Vivo Nex – in the new V15 Pro. Vivo confirmed the front camera design in a recently-released teaser showcasing brand ambassador and Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan with the phone’s pop-up front camera.NoneEverything teased so farThe Vivo Nex’s pop-up selfie camera, gave us the first truly notch-free phone, while the Nex Dual Display Edition took away the notch all-together. Now, the V15 Pro is the first to feature a 32-megapixel pop-up selfie camera.The teaser also points to an AI-powered triple camera setup and an eye-catching gradient finish underneath a glass panel. The device showcased in the video lacked a fingerprint sensor on the back, which points to an in-display fingerprint sensor.32MP Camera BreakdownAlthough no additional information about the front camera sensor has been revealed, the 32-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL Bright GD1 sensor – announced in 2018 – does seem like the obvious choice. The Samsung sensor features pixel patches of 0.8 micrometres which allows the device to capture high-resolution pictures. The sensor also delivers low-light sensitivity equivalent to a pixel 4 times the size, even if the resolution is bumped down. The GDI sensor also includes real-time HDR and gyro-based EIS, making for a pretty capable front camera.What to expect under-the-hood?Apart from the front camera, triple rear camera setup and in-display fingerprint sensor, there aren’t a lot of details available on the V15 Pro right now. However, going by the rumours, the V15 Pro is expected to be powered by a higher-midrange Snapdragon 675 SoC with 6GB of RAM and 128GB on-board storage.Meanwhile, the device is expected to sport an FHD+ Super AMOLED display panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a 3,700 mAh battery with the Vivo's Dual Engine fast charging technology.A Very-possible 48-megapixel CameraThe trend of 48-megapixel camera has gained a lot of steam with brands like Huawei, Xiaomi and Honor already coming up with phones with the sensor. And going by the rumours, Vivo too is following suit and will incorporate a 48-megapixel sensor as the primary camera in the triple-camera setup at the back."

However, there were certain comments which said that this attire is being forced by my dad and that he has double standards.I would like to say that the attire I wear or the choices I make in my life does not have anything to do with my parents.

content,"Andhra Pradesh police who claimed to have cracked the mysterious death case of serial entrepreneur Jayaram Chigurupati, named Rakesh Reddy, a private financier as the main accused in the murder.According to police, Rakesh Reddy allegedly killed Chigurupati over non-repayment of Rs 5.8 crore loan he had given to the latter.NoneChigurupati bought the publicly-listed Techtran that is engaged in manufacture and export of plastic ophthalmic lenses, in 2010. The company ran into losses before it locked out in 2015, resulting in job losses for workers.Chigurupati told this reporter that Techtran was struggling on account of Chinese dumping and shift of market from plastic to glass-based lenses.Chigurupati was facing severe cash crunch situation as his other venture - a 24x7 Telugu news channel Express TV was also bleeding heavily.The launch of the channel was itself a foolhardy decision, because 24x7 TV news is an overcrowded space, with over dozen channels competing against each other for an ever shrinking advertising pie. Most of these news channels are owned by politicians, realtors and businessmen, who underwrite losses to keep them afloat for serving their political and business interests. The rely on content such as political debates, crime, sensation and Tollywood entertainment.Chigurupati said he launched the channel to change that, but his channel too was caught in the same morass.With two badly managed companies bleeding him, he was struggling to pay bills and salaries, and was borrowing money from people such as Rakesh Reddy, with shady antecedents.It was alleged that Rakesh Reddy has a criminal record, and is busy in real estate and other settlements.Last India visitBut when Rakesh Reddy tried to recover the loan, Chigurupati avoided him, and wasn't accessible in person or through phone. That angered Rakesh Reddy.Chigurupati lived with his family in Jupiter, Florida, and travelled frequently to India to manage companies here.Reddy kept a track on Chigurupati's movements, and was biding his time.As usual, Chigurupati came to India in early January to look after his business affairs. Two of his investments, Hemarus Therapeutics, that makes blood proteins, and Coastal Bank, a local area bank, though not making tonnes of money, but are doing okay.During his latest visit that cost his life, Chigurupati was in India to replace the leadership of the bank. According to Coastal Bank website, it is said to be the first Local Area Bank approved by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1999.The Vijayawada-headquartered bank operates in five prosperous coastal Andhra districts of Krishna, Guntur, West Godavari, East Godavari and Visakhapatnam, through 50 branches.""Coastal Bank is filling the void left by the death of microfinance industry in Andhra Pradesh in a small way,"" said person who knew Chigurupati.""This was his best bet to make a comeback,"" the above person said.The bank's major business is micro loans targeting those under served by the conventional banking model. It lends at decent 13 to 14 percent interest rate to borrowers, employing banking correspondents who get a small commission on every loan.For FY18, the bank made a profit of Rs 14.52 crore, with a loan book of Rs 348 crore.Honey-trapped, tortured and killedAfter he knew that Chigurupati was back in Hyderabad. Rakesh Reddy is said to have moved ahead with his plan.Using a new SIM card, Rakesh Reddy allegedly created the WhatsApp profile of a woman on a name called Reena, who is believed to have invited Chigurupati  to come to a villa at Jubilee Hills.Chigurupati just walked into the trap. His weakness for women was cited by multiple people as a reason for some poor choices he made, possibly including the one that cost his life.He was allegedly detained by Rakesh Reddy and forced to make calls to a number of his close acquaintances including his niece Shikha Chaudhary for money.What Chigurupati could fetch was just Rs 7 lakh. It was also alleged by police that Rakesh Reddy tried to transfer the house of Chigurupati in plush Jubilee Hills on his name, but soon realised it was also mortgaged.Desperate and upset, Rakesh Reddy reportedly beat-up Chigurupati, a heart patient with three stents in his arteries.Chigurupati could have died on the spot due to heavy blows. Rakesh Reddy  along with help of another person called Srinivas is then believed to have tried to cover up the murder as accident by abandoning the body at an highway near Nandigama of Andhra Pradesh.The role of Shikha Chaudhary who was initially suspected, is yet to be established by Andhra Pradesh police.  There were allegations of Chaudhary being let off the hook, who allegedly had an affair with Rakesh Reddy for some time and is also director on Chigurupati's media venture and is seen as close to him, assisting his business.Chaudhary in an interview to local Telugu channel denied having any role in the murder of her uncle, and said she hasn't been in touch with Rakesh Reddy for a very long time.Chigurupati's wife Padma Shri expressed dissatisfaction over the manner in which the Andhra Pradesh police investigated the case."

content,NoneIGL volume at 5.9 MMSCMD with realizations of ` 27.7 per SCM (up 6% QoQ) was ahead of estimates. Gas cost also increased 7.5% sequentially due to higher LNG prices and currency depreciation. Gross spreads were strong at ` 11 per SCM. We believe that gas cost should come down sequentially and hence spreads should expand further. Volume growth outlook looks good and we believe that IGL should be able to maintain low double-digit volume growth trajectory driven by CNG economics and expansion in regions like Rewari and Gurugram. IGL has got full rights of CGD operations in high potential Gurugram region. This enhances our confidence on long term volume outlook.OutlookWe continue to like the story considering the business dynamics of IGL. We bring in FY21 estimates and value it on DCF. There can be some short term pressure on the stock price as the run up to the result was nearly 10% in the last few days.

datetime,2019-02-09 09:05:00+00:00
description,We have seen soybean futures jump of over 21 percent in January last year due to record hike in import duties on edible oil – palm and soft oils.
content,"Ritesh Kumar SahuSoybean futures climbed to a 30-month high in January supported by increasing demand from the domestic oil mills amid higher meal exports coupled with good domestic demand for edible oil in the country.Soybeans futures on National Commodities and Derivative Exchange (NCDEX) crossed Rs 3,900 per 100 kg but corrected due to profit booking to close at 3,838 levels.It is a fourth consecutive monthly gain in the price for soybean despite 30 percent higher output on year during the 2018-19 season.Moreover, there was concern over soybean output in South America, which has pushed soy oil prices in the International markets.On Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), soy oil prices jumped by over  9 percent in the month of January on concern over lower output in Brazil and Argentina due to erratic climatic conditions.India consumes about 50 lakh tonnes of soybean oil out of which 75 percent to 80 percent is imported from Argentina and Brazil.This year farmers of Madhya Pradesh, the largest soybean producing state, have higher bargaining power due to the implementation of Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY) where the government pays a flat bonus of Rs 500 per quintal to farmers over any above its selling price who sell their crop on time.However, during the last year’s Bhavantar Yojana, the government simply provide the difference between the selling price and the minimum support prices leaving no scope for the farmers to bargain for higher prices.We have seen soybean futures jump of over 21 percent in January last year due to record hike in import duties on edible oil – palm and soft oils.Soybean demand from the local oil millers was high due to its higher exports demand for soymeals. Soymeal exports have increased due to a surge in demand from Iran.India exported about over 3 lakh tonnes of soymeals to Iran during the October-December period compared to only 22,910 tonnes last year for the same period.According to monthly export data published by the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA), export of soymeals during December 2018, provisionally reported at 2.4 lakh tonnes compared to 1.6 lakh tonnes in December 2017, up by 42.4 percent.Overall, Soymeal exports during the October-December quarter was up by 29 percent to 5.77 lakh tonnes compared to 4.48 lakh tonnes the previous year.In 2018-19, soybean production is higher by over 30 percent due to a higher area and good climatic conditions. Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) in its latest press release forecast soybean output at 114.83 lakh tonnes for the 2018-19 season due to normal monsoon and higher acreage.However, USDA in its latest report pegged the soybean output estimate for marketing year (MY) 2018/19 (October-September) at 110 lakh tonnes, up 31 percent from last year production.In January, soybean futures climb over 12.5 percent but now corrected a bit due to profit booking. However, going forward, Soybean may trade positive towards Rs 4,100 per 100 kg (CMP: Rs 3,800) in the next 2-3 months if meal exports to Iran continue to rise during rest of the season.The price movements would mostly be positive as per its seasonality until the announcement of monsoon forecast in April-May while the price may fall if monsoon forecast turns normal.The author is Research Analyst- Agri- Commodities, at Angel Commodities Broking."

The offer is part of Thomson TV day sale on February 10 and 11.Talking to Moneycontrol, Avneet Singh Marwah, CEO, SPPL (Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd), exclusive brand licensee of Thomson TV in India, said, “We have a couple of downloaded apps which cater to all the premium segments for customers where the contribution of English content is about 2-3 percent. Now we wanted to target Tier 2-3 cities.”He asserted that people also want to watch premium content in regional language. This is where Zee5 could possibly work its magic. The online video platform is betting big on regional content and has also distinguished itself from other OTT (over the top) players with content that has mass appeal. “Our biggest USP is language content and that’s what differentiates us from others,"" said Manish Aggarwal, business head, Zee5 India. “We are betting aggressively on original content and we will continue to launch original content,” he added.The platform, which recorded 56.3 million monthly active users at the end of the December quarter, has 72 original shows across 6 Indian languages – Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. According to Aggarwal, “The reach comes through Zee5’s partnerships with the likes of Thomson TV, which further helps add more users.” The OTT platform witnessed a 23.3 percent YoY increase in its subscription revenue at Rs 618 crore, backed by a 28.6 percent YoY growth in domestic subscription revenue which stood at Rs519 crore, as per an IIFL analysis report. The report pointed out that a reason for higher-than-normal domestic subscription revenue growth was monetization of phase-III subscribers.The average time spent by Zee5 users currently on the platform is 31 minutes per day.Talking about the television market in India, Marwah said, “Currently we are standing on about 14 million sets a year. Out of that, the current share of smart TV is 65 percent. In addition, we are witnessing a 100 percent growth in smart TV year-on-year. Therefore, by the end of this year, 75-80 percent of televisions will be smart TVs.”“It is important that with a smart TV people have the right content with proper customization, or 'Indianisation',” Marwah added."

content,"The film market in Japan is not only home to Hollywood titles and to some extent Chinese and Korean films, but Indian movies are making a mark as well. And it is not just Bollywood that is charming its way into the hearts of the Japanese audience. Regional films from the southern market too have a huge fan following. Talking to Moneycontrol, Pranab Kapadia, President of Marketing and Distribution for UK, Europe & Africa Operations, Eros International Plc, said, ""Japan, like any other non-traditional market, is important as it opens new avenues for monetisation of content that has already been exploited amongst core Bollywood audiences.""""Already we have seen Rajnikanth films have a good following amongst mainstream Japanese audiences, now that is translating to select Bollywood films as well. This is a good sign for the industry,"" he added.   Responding to what content works in Japan, Kapadia said, ""It is very nascent to establish genre specific preferences but the common thread that has emerged as far as content connect is - human, emotional stories with some kind of message. Of course, the song and dance format have always created intrigue, interest and differentiation for Bollywood when compared to films from other countries/languages.""The song and dances in Indian films are having a strong influence on Japanese women who are taking dance classes to learn Bollywood moves. And this is emerging as one major factor that is drawing the Japanese audience, especially women to Bollywood films. The successful China story is a known narrative but recently many non-traditional markets have opened up for Indian films. These include countries like Taiwan, Turkey, Russia, Germany, among others. ""The gradual process of opening markets starts with participation in Film Festivals and syndication of films on local TV networks. There are several non-traditional markets where our films are showcased each year. From there the audiences get their first taste of Bollywood which, if positive, then leads to more frequent showcasing of shows in cinemas on the weekends. Finally, all stakeholders then aim for regular releases based on the response, explained Kapadia.He also said that in the past few years India has seen the emergence of markets like Portugal, Poland, Greece, Cyprus, Romania. In 2017, overseas theatricals contributed approximately 16 percent to the overall segment's revenue, an increase of approximately 3x from 2016, according to an EY 2018 report.  Kapadia said that recoveries from overseas theatrical are in the region of 10-15 percent of India. ""In some cases, this can go even as high as 30-40 percent. This is significant not only in terms of revenue but also as a barometer of acceptance of the content amongst the South Asian Diaspora,"" he added. "

content,"Twenty-nine-year-old advertising professional Chris Godfrey had a clear motive – to break Kylie Jenner’s record of having the most liked picture on Instagram.So, early in January this year, he set out on the task of beating the Insta queen at her own game.He decided to share the photo of an egg to see if something as simple and routine as an egg could do the trick. First shared on January 4 on UK-based Instagram account @world_record_egg, the photo of the golden brown egg has close to 50 million likes. The photo shared was a stock image, originally clicked by Sergey Platonov.While Godfrey chose to remain anonymous for the longest time, 19-year-old Massachusetts-based marketing guru Ishan Goel said he helped the photo gain maximum traction on the social media platform by getting in touch with his celebrity and influencer friends.NoneInterestingly, Godfrey junked all such claims and said the account’s growth was “completely organic”. No one person helped the egg’s rise in popularity and no single account or group of accounts helped it to explode.Getting in touch with his network of influencers and celebrities, Goel acted as a catalyst in letting Godfrey break the record of Kylie Jenner's post (that announced the birth of her daughter where she got 19 million likes on Instagram).None“Celebrities wield so much power and influence, and an egg uniting so many people is a powerful commentary on social media's impact on society today. Social media has given celebrities this sort of omnipotence,” he said.NoneGoel, on the other hand, attributed the popularity of the post to how people wanted the thrill of seeing something as simple as an egg overriding the popularity of an international celebrity."

title,Distribution Days: How to track market weakness in a confirmed uptrend

description,"When the market is in a confirmed uptrend, it is the best time to make most of your gains. This is when most breakouts are successful and hence, an investor carefully following the patterns of his/her stocks can realize big gains."
content,"Vipin KhareWe all know the importance of market status in determining an investor’s stance in the CANSLIM style.It not only helps you realize gains by being aggressive when the risk is minimal but also protects you from unwarranted risks of markets.When the market is in a confirmed uptrend, it is the best time to make most of your gains. This is when most breakouts are successful, and hence an investor carefully following the patterns of his/her stocks to realize big gains.But how can you pre-empt the probable weakness in the market so that one can lock-in gains and play defensive with less or no exposure? A distribution day can provide a systematic and credible approach to do that.What is Distribution Day?A distribution day is when a market representative index (for example, Nifty 50) loses more than 0.2 percent in a day, with volume higher than that of the previous session.When a distribution day occurs, it hints that big institutional investors are exiting or reducing their positions in the market. Institutional activity is what moves any market, especially in India where retail participation is small.How does it help in sensing market weakness?When the market is in an uptrend, the intensity of market weakness is determined by the distribution day count. An investor keeps count of all valid distribution days (as per above definition) during an uptrend.Successive distribution days imply a weakening market. But what threshold of distribution day count is enough to say the market is under pressure?A distribution day count of 2-3 is benign and usually normal in an uptrend. But when the count goes to 5-6, one should prepare to get his/her positions trimmed.Distribution Day Expiry:Even though a distribution day hints that institutions may be liquidating their positions, it loses its impact after 25 trading sessions. A distribution day is also removed from the count after the index rallies 5 percent above that day’s close.When the Nifty 50 started in a Confirmed Uptrend from July 10 onwards, it experienced its first distribution day on July 18 (D1) and the second on August 10 (D2).The third, fourth, and fifth distribution days occurred on August 29 (D3), September 4 (D4), and September 11 (D5), respectively. D1 had already expired by then, putting the total distribution day count at 4. But the market started showing weakness with the fifth distribution day count (D6) on September 18.None(The author is Director-Research, William O'Neil India)"

This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction.It is characterized by a contracting range in prices coupled with an upward trend in prices which is known as a rising wedge or a downward trend in prices which is known as a falling wedge.a) Bullish Wedge: (Falling Wedge)The falling Wedge is a bullish pattern that begins wide at the top and contracts as prices move lower. This price action forms a cone that slopes down as the reaction highs and reaction lows converge. In contrast to symmetrical triangles, which have no definitive slope and no bias falling wedges definitely slope down and have a bullish bias. However, this bullish bias cannot be realized until a resistance breakout.The falling wedge can also fit into the continuation category. As a continuation pattern, the falling wedge will still slope down, but the slope will be against the prevailing uptrend.As a reversal pattern, the falling wedge slopes down and with the prevailing trend. Regardless of the type whether reversal or continuation falling wedges are regarded as bullish patterns.Noneb) Bearish Wedge: (Rising Wedge)The Rising Wedge is a bearish pattern that begins wide at the bottom and contracts as prices move higher and the trading range narrows.

title,Correct handling of Time Value decay in Option can lead to higher returns
datetime,2019-02-10 09:11:00+00:00
description,"While the certainty closes the door for any positive surprise in the market, it certainly gives an opportunity to create a defense mechanism to deal with its ill effects due to the vary in predictability of the Time Value decay."
content,"Shubham AgarwalAs we have discussed a few times before as well, Time Value element in Options is a tricky part to handle because unlike Price of the underlying, Time Value is a certain phenomenon like Death and Taxes.While the certainty closes the door for any positive surprise in the market, it most certainly gives us an opportunity to create a defense mechanism to deal with its ill effects due to the varying predictability of the Time Value decay.Let us today discuss a few of those adjustments that we can keep in mind to optimize this wasting element in option premium.Two characteristics of Time Value decay has to be kept in mind during this discussion#1 Time Value Decay is a constant phenomenon, a bit of Option premium would be reduced every day for sure#2 There is a pattern in which Premium erodes due to the passage of time. The speed of this erosion is slow at the beginning of the expiry and erosion is faster towards the end of the expiryIn other words, Speed of Decay in Option Premiums due to the passage of Time is indirectly correlated with Time left for Expiry.This brings us to the simplest and the first Re-Shaping of Option Trade according to time left for expiry. The easiest and the most basic Option trade is to Buy or go Long on a single Option, Buy a Call or a Put.While the gain or loss in this option is mainly predicated to the movement in the price of the underlying, we still have to account for time value. Hence, conventional wisdom says along with a price stop loss on the underlying do have a time stop loss for a Long Option trade as well.Now keeping the Characteristic #2 in mind the addition to the conventional wisdom that we are trying to impose is the magnitude of the time stop loss.Simple to understand, logical and has kind of worked for me in the past is this time stop loss gauge. Hold a Long Option with Time Stop-Loss (No. of Days) = No. of Weeks Left for Expiry.So essentially, we would hold Long Option at the beginning of the expiry for 4 days post which if trigger Time Stop-Loss. Similarly, in the week of expiry since the number of weeks left for expiry are zero, we would get rid of the options during the day itself.Going one step further in Vertical Spreads where we have one Long Option along with one short Option of the same type, expiry but in relatively higher Call/ Lower Put, the reshaping comes in terms of choice of these strikes.In the beginning of the expiry it is prudent to keep larger gaps (2-3 strikes) between Long and Short Options due to very heaviness in the time value element. This gap can narrow down to just 1 strike towards the end of the expiry.Last but not least, considering the speed of time value decay when ratios are to be resorted. Avoid selling multiple options in the beginning of the expiry against one Option bought (Ratio Spread). Similarly, avoid Buying multiple Options against one Option short (Ratio Back spread) towards the end of the expiry.In fact, keep it opposite, resort to Back Ratios in the first week of the expiry and resort to Ratio spreads towards the end of the expiry. Correct handling of Time Value decay in Option can actually accentuate Return from the same view.(The author is CEO & Head of Research at Quantsapp Private Limited.)"

title,DATA STORY | India among top 10 countries with high quality research institutes but there's a catch!
datetime,2019-02-08 07:29:00+00:00
description,"Time and again, questions have been raised on the quality and authenticity of the research output in India."
content,"NoneWhile India ranks among the top 10 countries with high quality of research institutes, there is a catch. It scores just 0.42 out of 5 in the quality of research institutions index. USA tops the list with a score of 3.88.NoneOne of the reasons why India makes it to the top 10 is because the quality of research across the globe remains poor. The top spots are occupied by developed economies such as the US, China, France, Germany and others, who are in a position to fund research institutes.NoneNoneNoneIn contrast, France spends 2.25 percent of its GDP on research, and the United States, 2.74 percent.Interestingly, India's spend on R&D has been rising but the percentage of GDP devoted towards it has been declining. The low spends answer why India lacks the resources required for conducting high-quality researches.NoneTime and again, questions have been raised on the quality and authenticity of the research output in India and policymakers have long been aware of the dismal state of research.In 2013, the government launched a string of initiatives such as Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan or the National Higher Education Mission to boost the number of researchers in higher education. Two years later, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) was launched to rank universities and institutes in various parameters, including research.Subsequently, the government also announced the ‘Institutes of Eminence (IoE)’ scheme, where it initially pledged to support 20 institutes to become world-class universities – of which six have already been announced and more than a dozen are awaiting the status upgrade. While it may be too early to judge whether these measures will bear fruits in the future, the government may have to continue working in this direction.NoneThe scarcity of compensation or funds for scholars, however, is not the only reason behind the research crisis in the country. The woes of India's education system are rooted in early schooling.NoneThe survey, which focused on the quality of education at various institutes, said that teens couldn't successfully perform simple activities like counting money, adding weights and telling time.NoneNoneThe government policies too play a major role in the publication of a large number of bogus journals and researches. In 2010, the University Grants Commission (UGC) introduced the academic performance indicator (API) for evaluation of teachers, which laid considerable emphasis on the number of research publications (‘publish or perish’). It further mandated publication of at least two papers prior to the submission of a doctoral thesis in 2013.As a result of these guidelines, publication in journals spurt due to the required 'compliance' criterion in the university system. This also triggered the publication of predatory/dubious journals offering 'pay and publish' services for gullible authors in the country.India needs to support researches and development within the country, bring in laws to check the loopholes that exist in the laws and set up a strict monitoring body to check the research quality."

PAT grew 32 percent YoY to Rs 350 crore on the back of strong EBITDA growth, partly offset by higher depreciation cost.

Given strong balance sheet, higher dividend can also provide support.Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 720 | Return: 38 percentWe expect advertising/domestic subscription revenue CAGR of 12/18 percent over FY19-21. However, (i) new launches on Sun TV and Sun Life channels, (ii) higher content- and marketing-led investments in Bangla channel and (iii) significant investments for ramping up original content on Sun Nxt platform would exert pressure on margins. Consequently, over FY19-21, we expect margins to contract 200bp to 69.2 percent and EBITDA CAGR of 12 percent.We roll forward valuation to FY21E, valuing Sun TV at a target price of Rs 720 (prior: Rs 750), ascribing 15x (around 30 percent discount to three-year average due to mounting pressure on viewership share and increasing investments across both traditional and digital medium) P/E to FY21E EPS.However, the stock has corrected around 15 percent over the last three months, and thus, appears attractively valued at 12.4x/11.0x FY20/21E EPS.

content,"Part 1 of Moneycontrol podcast with Sanjay Bakshi. Subsequent parts to be published every day this week.Hello and welcome to Moneycontrol Podcast. I am Santosh Nair in conversation with Professor Sanjay Bakshi. Before I get chatting, here is a brief introduction about him.Professor Bakshi is considered to be one of the best minds in India in the fields of value investing and behavioural finance. Besides these two subjects, he also teaches corporate governance and forensic accounting at Management Development Institute, Gurugram.And he not only teaches value investing, but also practises it as Managing Partner at ValueQuest Capital.Thank you for joining us on the show Professor Bakshi.NoneQ: Tell us what got you interested in investing? Was this your first choice as a career?A: Well, almost everything that has happened to me in life has been sort of accidental. In this case, I used to see my dad, who was a value investor. He is the kind of investor that you profiled in your book--old school, faith-based investor who would pick up an entrepreneur and blindly follow him. The entrepreneur my dad picked up was a guy called Dhirubhai Ambani and he used to have a lot of faith in Dhirubhai’s ability to compound capital. We all know that Dhirubhai was instrumental in creating the equity cult in India. So, my father was part of that cult and he used to talk about him all the time.I used to watch him as a kid at that time and it turns out that my dad did fairly well. He was a bureaucrat in the government and he used to invest in the stock market and his favourite stock was Reliance and he made money in that. I am actually grateful to Dhirubhai because he funded my first motorcycle, because my dad sold some shares in Reliance Industries to gift me a motorbike. I used to see dad work very hard in his office and he would go at like 8:30 or 9:00 clock in the morning and come late at the evening but his investing hardly took any time and I thought that this is really cool, you can make money and you can fund bikes from equities. So that’s how I originally got interested in the idea of investing. I was in school then.Then I got into college and there I ended up partnering with a friend and we ended up investing in some IPOs and we lost money. So that was a big lesson. Fast forward, after finishing my graduation I ended up doing my chartered accountancy. In my chartered accountancy course, I learnt everything about accounting and how transactions end up becoming financial statements. I could pick up all of that but I had no clue about the quality of the business or the management.I had no idea about that and I certainly had no idea about human nature in psychology. Then I ended up getting a scholarship to study at the London School of Economics. It was in the LSE where I accidentally discovered the idea of value investing. Till then, I had no idea about what value investing exactly was. I was just watching my dad and I was just speculating in the IPO market and blowing money.At LSE, I was taught that standard academic finance papers that markets are efficient and there are no mispriced bets, you should just buy the market portfolio and then I accidentally came across an article in the newspaper about this obscure guy who operates out of a town called Omaha. This was 1990 and you know Warren Buffett wasn’t as well as known as he is right now and that article said a few things which was quite contrary to what I was being taught.Things like he has a wonderful track record, he stays far away from the stock market and he believes that markets are often quite wrong and the article also said that you could get his letters in which he explained his thoughts on investing, about the world of business and you could get them for free.I was very inspired by that and I wrote to him and his secretary wrote back that they would be happy to send the letters, but I had to send them the postage money, which is probably the best investment I ever made. I got those letters in about four or five days and basically I found the calling when I read those letters because as I mentioned I already had an accounting background, I was already a graduate from University of Delhi after having done B. Com (Hons).So, I knew business law, a little bit of economics and in my CA, I had learnt accounting and auditing and when I read through those letters I could start connecting the dots that there is a way, there is a method of investing which can create a lot of value, will make you a lot of money. Through those letters I discovered Buffett’s teacher Ben Graham who taught him at Colombia University and of course I went and bought all the books of Ben Graham and all the editions of Security Analysis and I bought Intelligent Investor. As I was going through those books I discovered a very interesting piece; it has not appeared anywhere else to my mind.In the third edition of Security Analysis, there is piece called ‘Special Situations’ where Graham describes how to make money in the stock market without thinking about fundamentals, without predicting future fundamental information, without studying balance sheets.Basically, he was doing what we now call as risk arbitrage - event-driven strategies, tender offers and buybacks and recapitalisations where the outcome of your investment operation is dependent on the happening and the non-happening of a corporate event, nothing to do with markets. So that was very interesting to me for two reasons; one you get uncorrelated returns, and two, you don’t have to predict things. You don’t have to even do a lot of fundamental analysis. So that was one piece which was very influential to me in Special Situations.The second, essay that I read through was in the Appendix to the Intelligent Investor. In the 50th year of the publication of Security Analysis in 1984 Warren Buffett went to Colombia University and gave a talk that is a famous talk, all early investors know about. It is called The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. In that talk, there was a certain passage which when I read just blew my mind.Q: What was that?A: That passage was that Buffett uses a metaphor of a gun and he says that if you have a gun which has got six chambers in it and If I put a bullet in one chamber and you ask me how much do you want to be paid to pull the trigger once, I am not going to pull it and even if it’s a million dollars and if somebody asks you that I will give you two million dollars, will you pull it now? And that’s a positive correlation between risk and reward.But in value investing, it is the opposite. If you are buying a $100 bill for $110 it is risky, but if you are buying it at $60 it is less risky. But the expectation of reward is higher in the latter case that if you buy it for $60 and it goes back to fair value you make money. If you buy it $110 and goes back to fair value, you lose money.So, over here you have less risk of loss, but the return is higher which was extremely counter-intuitive to me because as I mentioned I was studying in the LSE and the professors over there were telling me that if you want to make more money you have got to take more risk.This guy is saying the opposite that if you want to make more money you got to take less risk and I said, this guy is saying something which is exact opposite of what I have been taught and I have got to know more about this stuff. As I worked through the examples of Ben Graham’s books I basically found my calling and decided that this is what I want to do and I came back to India.Q: What was the experience like when you came back to India?A: Very tough. Before I went to the LSE, I worked for a company called American Express for six months and that period of working in American Express they told me that I am unemployable, I can’t work for any boss or anything like that. So when I returned from London, I never wanted to work for another company. I had to be on my own, but I had no money. And I came back with Rs 3 lakh.My net worth was Rs 3,00,000 at the time. If you want to start your career as a value investor you can’t do much with Rs 3 lakh. By then, I already had a daughter. I had been married in 1990 and came back with a daughter. I had a family to support. It was very tough in the initial years and I started writing columns for money and I used to write two or three columns a week. So, I did a lot of those and then I started teaching in a couple of business schools just to sustain myself while I was building a career as a value investor.I then went to friends and family members and I collected a pool of capital, a princely sum of Rs 20 lakh, which was given to me more out of pity by my friends and family than out of any conviction, because I had really no track record at that time. They just knew that this is a decent person, let’s give him some money, let’s back him.That’s what I tell all my students: if you want to start their career as a value investor and don’t have enough money to begin with, you will need other people’s money and those people are almost certainly going to be people who trust you, people who have known you, which is basically your childhood friends and your family members. So that’s how I started, but four or five years was very tough.Q: So you collected Rs 20 lakh and invested all the money in stocks. How did it turn out?A: It was very painful, because I had all this theoretical knowledge and I thought I was a hotshot value investor who has learnt everything, read up everything on Buffett and Graham and I am a qualified chartered accountant and I can crack this. In three years I lost 40 percent of the money and part of the money came from mother-in law.Q: That’s tough.A: That’s very tough. But it is a blessing in the sense losing money in the early part of your journey is very painful but it teaches you a few things.Q: So, how did your friends take to the bad news early on? Did they eventually make a decent enough return on that investment?A: Well ultimately, they all redeemed and I bought them out because it was sort of a loosely held investment partnership. As I became more evolved as an investor and got more clients, I bought all of them out over a period of time and they were happy about the outcome. I don’t want to say that they had great outcomes but nobody lost money and they did pretty okay.Q: What were the learnings from that maiden venture as a professional money manager? What were the things you felt you did right and where did you go wrong?A: If you recall we just spoke about my experiences even before that I have speculated in IPOs. Everybody was making money in IPOs and I got in at the wrong time with the wrong issues and I lost money. When I read through Graham’s books, I came across passages telling why you should stay away from IPOs. He wrote that there were lots of salesmanship behind these issues and there was the timing factor as well.Entrepreneurs are not going to come and give you their companies for a song at the bottom of bear market. Typically, it will be in a bull market cycle that you will see a lot of IPO activity happening. In the secondary market, shares trade every day. So, the probability that you will find a bargain in the secondary market is so much higher than in the primary market. I could relate as to why those losses occurred by studying the reasons. I gradually learnt about what to avoid, how to avoid those things. So, that was one thing that happened.The early experience for me was really about learning from losses and one thing which I have learnt over the years is you are going to have losses in this field all that time.Taking losses or facing losses in the early part of your journey has been good for me and it is good for almost everybody, provided you can get the right lessons from that. One thing which I have learnt by reading a little about behavioural economics is about the power of framing. If you frame those losses and the money that you lost in those losses and just give them a label of tuition fees paid then that helps. Psychologically it helps you, number one.Number two, if it is a hefty tuition fee that you have paid then, you are not likely to make the same mistakes again and it also gives you hope. You have learnt something, move on and don’t make the same mistake again because you have already graduated and you paid the tuition fees. So, education will come from your losses in that sense. The idea of framing losses as tuition fees has been very helpful to me. That was one thing which happened.There is something else that happened to me and I have rarely spoken about it. It is the first time I am doing in public. In 1990 when I was a student at the LSE, one of my father’s friends settled in England took me and my wife to a casino, Victoria Casino, Edgware Road in London.There, I gambled for the first time in my life in a casino. It was the first time I actually entered a casino and I made money and when I made money I felt happy. I thought that I had discovered a way of becoming rich quick. To you and the listeners, it may now sound ridiculous, but at that time when I made money for the first time I thought I had invented a new way of life, that I could double my bets and double them again, using the Martingale strategy that people use. I made money, you could say it was beginners luck, but I got hooked on to it.Q: Do you recall how much money you exactly made on that bet?A: Initially I made about 20-30 pounds. Because, I was now hooked, I was bunking classes and going there. I was there before the casino opened and I was there right till the evening and I would gamble. One day I made 2,000 pounds which was an enormous amount of money for my net worth at that point of time. It was an enormous sum of money for a student living on scholarship…it was huge.I felt that this is what I can do for life. I have found a way of gambling and I was using some methods, so-called methods, which almost always will make you go broke ultimately, which is what happened to me too.But I got hooked and I gambled more because one thing which happens in gambling is that if you make money you are going to go back, you gamble more, very few people actually say that I made money I was lucky, let me walk away. It’s extremely difficult to walk away. You go back. I went back and I lost everything and more and then I became extremely emotional about it because my wife was working early mornings in the winter to support me, because I didn’t have money for financial support for living expenses and living in London was very expensive.So, she was supporting my education and I blew up all of my net worth and I felt terrible about it and then I made a pledge that I am not going to go to a casino or if I go I am not going to gamble and I stayed with that since then. Many years later, my wife and I went to Las Vegas and I gave her all the chips that the hotels give you for free, I said you go to the tables, I am not going.The reason I mention this today is that those losses you suffer are emotionally very distressing, but they are also very instructive. At least for me they made me aware of risk, as to what can go wrong. In his book, Ben Graham defines what is the meaning of investing, and he starts with a very simple definition. He says, “an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal plus an adequate return”. Safety of principal plus an adequate return. Safety of principle comes before, the adequate return comes later and this is very important and lot of people don’t get this and I certainly didn’t get it at that time. There is another guy called Will Rogers who said pretty much the same thing in a much more entertaining manner and he said, “I am more concerned with the return of my money than the return on my money”."

title,Explained | Gujjar agitation for reservation: Why is the community up in arms in Rajasthan?
datetime,2019-02-11 21:05:00+00:00
description,Members of the Gujjar community are demanding 5 percent reservation under the Special Backwards Category (SBC).
content,"NoneThe agitation even turned violent in Dholpur on February 10 with unidentified miscreants firing 8-10 rounds in the air. Three police vehicles, including two jeeps and a bus, were set afire by agitators, Superintendent of Police (SP) Ajay Singh told PTI.Things were about to go out of hand when the law enforcement authorities imposed Section 144 in Dholpur and neighbouring Karauli districts.But why are the Gujjars up in arms and what are their demands? Let’s take a closer look:Who are the Gujjars?The Gujjars are a pastoral community who constitute about 5 percent of Rajasthan’s population, according to the 1931 caste census. Present in around 21 districts, the community has traditionally been supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).NoneWhy are they up in arms?Members of the Gujjar community are demanding 5 percent reservation under the Special Backwards Category (SBC).But, weren’t they already covered in the OBC category?The Gujjars have been covered under the OBC category since 1994. However, in 2006, they demanded that their community be given reservations under the Scheduled Tribe category. After the Chopra Commission ruled that Gujjars cannot be covered under the ST category, they settled for 5 percent reservation under a new SBC category.But this crossed the 50 percent ceiling of reservations earmarked by the Supreme Court, and was eventually quashed by Rajasthan High Court.Haven’t previous governments overruled this judgment?In 2008, the Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government had tabled a bill granting 5 percent reservation to Gujjars and four other communities under the SBC category.After the Rajasthan High Court stayed the bill, the ruling BJP tabled it again in September 2015. The Rajasthan High Court struck it down again in December 2016.An unyielding Rajasthan government again introduced a bill to raise the OBC quota from 21 percent to 26 percent, granting the additional 5 percent to Gujjars. This too was struck down by the high court on grounds of breaching the 50 percent ceiling for reservation.What is the current status of reservation in Rajasthan?Scheduled Caste – 16%Scheduled Tribe – 12 %Other Backward Classes (OBCs) – 21%Gujjars (Under Most Backward Class) – 1%Total – 50 %Is this the first Gujjar agitation?NoneWho is spearheading these protests?An octogenarian Lieutenant Colonel (retd) Kirori Singh Bainsla has been leading the community since 2006 when the Gujjars staged a sit-in on railway tracks in Karauli district.None"

content,"Southeast Asian fashion startup Zilingo said it has raised $226 million in its latest funding round from existing backers such as venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, with Singapore's Temasek Holdings joining as a new investor.The Series D financing follows a $54 million fundraising last year, taking the total capital raised by the company to $308 million. The company declined to provide valuation.The latest round included Singapore investment fund EDBI and previous investors Burda Principal Investments, a division of Germany's Hubert Burda Media, and Belgian investment firm Sofina, Zilingo said in a statement on Tuesday.The Singapore-headquartered company plans to use the funds to invest in infrastructure and technology to further integrate and digitise the fashion and beauty supply chain, it said.Zilingo, whose main market for the consumer business is Indonesia, is expanding in countries such as Australia in 2019.The company, which started as a fashion marketplace, has been rapidly growing its business-to-business (B2B) tools and platforms, which include providing value-added services to its merchants as well as a marketplace to help them source efficiently from manufacturers.The company, which also acts as an affiliate for companies to provide financing to small firms on its platform, is now earning the bulk of its revenue from its B2B business.Zilingo has grown its revenues by four times in the last 12 months, it said, but did not provide specific numbers.""We are pretty close to profitability and have a clear path to it,"" Ankiti Bose, the company's co-founder and CEO, told Reuters. Bose founded the company in 2015 with Dhruv Kapoor, its chief technology officer.In Southeast Asia, local fashion e-commerce players such as Zalora, 'Love, Bonito' and JD.com-backed fashion retailer Pomelo compete with global platforms like ASOS. A study by Google and Temasek has forecast that e-commerce in Southeast Asia will exceed $100 billion in gross merchandise value by 2025 from over $23 billion in 2018.Bose said purely selling to consumers would mean that the only way to win is through price wars and discounting."

title,Badminton player PV Sindhu emerges as a good bet in the brand endorsement world
datetime,2019-02-11 22:10:00+00:00
description,"Experts believe that it is Sindhu’s youth, consistency, fitness and her achievements that brands want to cash in."
content,"Ace badminton player PV Sindhu is not only scoring high on the field but is also attracting big numbers in the endorsement space. Recently, she bagged a sponsor deal to the tune of Rs 50 crore from Chinese sports brand Li Ning, which according to the company is one of the biggest deals in the world of badminton. But does that mean she is superseding Bollywood celebrities in the brand world?Talking to Moneycontrol, brand strategist and founder, Harish Bijoor Consults Inc, Harish Bijoor said “I wouldn’t say it is a better deal than Bollywood stars but to take Rs 50 crore and say that Rs 40 crore is brand endorsement money and Rs 10 crore is for equipment. See, Rs 40 crore is the key amount of money and it is a good bet. It says that we are betting on Sindhu to be the world’s next number one player. China likes that. The brand picking Sindhu as their ambassador means it is a forecast of Sindhu’s future to an extent, considering that they have evaluated the chances of many stars.”According to a 2018 Duff and Phelps report on India’s most powerful celebrity brands, while Bollywood celebrities dominate the top ranks of the top 20 celebrity brands, sportspersons – including players like PV Sindhu, Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, etc –are giving them a tough competition.According to the report, these sports personalities collectively contribute almost  $241 million, which is over 27 percent of the cumulative brand value of the top 20 celebrities pegged at $877 million.With a brand value of  $21.6 million, Sindhu is associated with as many as 13 brands. Her endorsement fees have also seen a hike, now standing between Rs 1 crore and Rs 1.5 crore.“From the early days, there has been a 400 percent increase (in endorsement fees) from the time when she won that silver. Just imagine what will happen when she hits a gold,” said Bijoor.After winning a silver medal at the Rio Games, Sindhu had inked an endorsement deal worth Rs 500 million from Baseline Ventures, a sports marketing, entertainment, and brand licensing firm. This was the highest contract offered to a non-cricketing sportsperson in India.As Sindhu continues to break her own records, what is helping her grab better deals?Hailing the recent deal, Bijoor said, “What is to be appreciated is that this is a global brand endorsement, not an Indian one.”He explained, “Badminton is a global game – to an extent, it is more global than cricket in terms of the number of countries playing it. So, it attracts the best eyeballs from across the globe. If there is a brand who wants to grab eyeballs, this is a great sport to back.”Other experts believe that it is Sindhu’s youth, consistency, fitness and her achievements that brands want to cash in.However, it was not an easy journey for Sindhu in the endorsement market, particularly during the initial days. Due to cricket’s dominance in the space, Sindhu’s managers had to convince companies to consider her as a player who is moving up the curve as against cricketers who already are at their peak.Sindhu is now among the top-earning women athletes in the world with total earnings of $8.5 million, out of which her income from endorsements stands at $8 million.In 2017, Sindhu took the 13th spot in the Forbes celebrity rich list with earnings equalling Rs 57.25 crore. She had climbed 49 points from 2016, courtesy 16 brand endorsements in 2017 helping boost her earnings by almost 1,600 percent.“She is climbing for sure. Within the sport, she is a specialist and she certainly has hit the top rung,” said Bijoor.Sindhu endorses brands like Moov, Myntra, and sports drink Gatorade, among others."

title,Here's why liquidity is important when making long-term investments
datetime,2019-02-12 09:25:00+00:00
description,Some apparently illiquid avenues can be tapped in smart ways.
content,"While working with a pharmaceutical multi-national company in India in 2013, Mumbai-based 42-years old Rupali Kalav  bought a flat in Navi Mumbai for Rs 58 lakh using home loan. At that time, it was a lucrative investment as other investors were making returns in 16% to 18% range on their real estate investments. Tax savings with home loans were further sweetening the deal.However, things changed over a period of time. Demonetisation and structural slowdown on account of massive supply made the real estate market dull.Two years ago, when Rupali took entrepreneurial plunge in brand communication and marketing technology, the reality hit her hard. Her unpredictable business income made timely repayment of equated monthly instalment difficult. When she decided to sell the property in February 2017, she found it difficult to sell.Rupali Kalav says, “Over the period of loan tenure, I am going to pay almost double the price it was quoting at. And the market is so bad that prospective buyers are willing to offer only Rs 55 lakh.”A point to note, her adventure in ‘real estate investing’ accounts for more than 70% of her investments.Importance Of emergency cashInability to liquidate your investments at fair price can be a big problem.“Many times investors are keen to invest for ten years or more at the time of preparing of financial plan. But life throws its own challenges. And despite maintaining emergency funds, investors may be forced to withdraw their investments aimed at long-term financial goals,” says Gajendra Kothari, managing director and CEO, Etica Wealth Management.If we dig deeper into the portfolios of individuals we would come across many instances of ignoring liquidity which leads to loss of peace of mind.Some do maintain cash or bank balances just enough to take care of recurring monthly expenses, but overlook non-monthly and unavoidable expenses such as – donations, school fee payments, car servicing costs, hospitalisation.“It is better to address the liquidity need by maintaining an emergency fund equal to at least six months of expenses. Otherwise, one may be forced to sell his long-term investments to pay for his daily needs,” says Pankaj Mathpal, founder and CEO of Mumbai based Optima Money Managers.Once you align cashflows with your needs, rest of the money can be invested in such a manner that your financial goals are achieved. For example, if you are in high tax bracket – say 30% and keen to invest for a goal due three years from now then it is better to employ mix of fixed maturity plans (FMP) and short-term bond funds. Even if you want to lock in interest rates, do not go overboard with FMP.Putting all your money in FMP hands you over an illiquid portfolio. You may have planned it well, but always keep some of your investments in liquid vehicles as they can be used to overcome any unforeseen emergency.Does liquidity come at a cost of high returns?Many investors get carried away with low fund management expenses charged by exchange traded funds (ETF). But most of them are rarely traded at fair value on Indian stock exchanges. A look at past one month’s data reveals that out of 64 ETFs traded on National Stock Exchange, 37 ETFs have recorded average trading volumes below 5,000 units per day.If you have accumulated large quantity of an ETF, you may find it troublesome to monetise it.NoneAn asset class that is out of favour typically suffers from liquidity. But when the same asset class starts generating returns, it also attracts more investors and brings back volume-driven liquidity. For example, if gold continues its journey up, one may see increased volumes in SGB and it may further lead to decrease in discount to fair value of SGB in secondary market.“Never look at liquidity at a given moment of time. You should look at expected liquidity,” says Ramalingam K, founder and CEO, Holistic Investment Planners.NoneLiquidity or lock-in: how to choose?That’s the dilemma. If you tilt a lot towards liquidity, you could end up sacrificing returns. But investments that are designed to benefit over the long run, come with lock-ins.For example, National Pension Scheme (NPS) is gaining investor attention because one can better manage tax at the time of superannuation and also get regular income. It also gives tax benefit at the time of investing. Low fund management charge and solutions such as lifecycle investing make it even more attractive.But it is an illiquid investment. Before reaching 60 years of age, you can only make three partial withdrawals if you have been a subscriber for at least three years. You are allowed to withdraw up to 25% of your contributions (not accumulated amount). Also such withdrawals are allowed for specified reasons such as higher education and marriage of children, buying of residential house and treatment of critical illness.Some apparently illiquid avenues can be tapped in smart ways. For example, PPF comes with a 15 year tenure. The biggest advantage of PPF account is you need not commit an investment of a fixed sum in each year while opening an account. You can start with Rs 500 and keep investing small amount of money each year when you are running short of money. As you grow this, PPF account can be utilised to your advantage.“Before you invest your money, you have all the choices. But once you invest, your investment shall dictate the choices,” says Vivek Rege, founder and CEO of V R Wealth Advisors.Can you sell your investments in part? That is another way of looking at liquidity. When you invest in an equity mutual fund, you can sell some units or you may choose to exit altogether. But can you sell half a property?“Property should not account for more than 50% of your total investment portfolio,” says Gajendra Kothari. “As you approach retirement, bring down your exposure to real estate typically towards 25% as it is difficult to maintain these physical investments in old age.”"

title,Book Excerpt: R Gopalakrishnan on the cultures of Unilever and Tata Group
datetime,2019-02-11 18:17:00+00:00
description,"While Unilever is highly process-oriented and goal-driven, reveals the author, while Tata Sons is very Indian and highly relationship-oriented."
content,"Former Tata Sons director R Gopalakrishnan, in his new book titled The Made in India Manager, uses anecdotes to explain the difference in decision-making between Unilever and Tata Sons. Here are excerpts from the book that have been reproduced with permission from publisher Hachette India.When the vectors of thought and action are aligned, you get the best possible combination of efficiency and effectiveness. The concept appears to be axiomatic, and three examples might help to illustrate the point. First, if the mindset in an organization dictates that differences with senior colleagues must not be expressed openly, and that is aligned with the action vector, you can get an outcome that is effective and efficient within that context. Of course, that does not mean that the outcome is a good one. Take the case of Korean Air, which faced frequent air crashes between 1988 and 1998. When an enquiry was finally conducted it turned out that the chief pilot’s social status was so high in Korean society that junior officers would usually be oblique in their communication with him, even in cases that required direct and urgent action. In many instances this led to dire consequences as co-pilots would simply allow the pilot to take major decisions even if they were questionable. Second, under the leadership of Jack Welch, General Electric (GE) decided that a rigorous portfolio analysis with a transparent methodology was essential to enhance shareholder value. This mindset, combined with their capability for disciplined execution, delivered hugely positive outcomes which have been well documented. Third, public-sector banks in India are known to have the persistent problem of non-performing assets (NPAs). Publicly available commentaries display a high level of skill in data-gathering, analysis and policy options, but the execution of those ideas gets bogged down in socio-cultural issues such as a politician–businessman nexus, deference to authority and an orientation towards relationships rather than discipline when it comes to making decisions.What are the manifestations of a two-axis manager? How does it show up in business conduct? Here are some examples that illustrate the various ways in which Indian managers sometimes think in English but act in Indian.For the first, we draw on one of the authors’ (Gopal) personal experiences in corporate India. ‘From my personal experience, I worked in Unilever for three decades and in Tata Sons for almost two. I survived and grew in both because I adapted to their unique cultures. My comments are not intended to suggest that one is superior to the other. The observations below are just what they are – they provide a contrast. ‘Unilever is highly process-oriented and goal-driven in articulating ambitions and getting things done. It is very Anglo-American in its approach in that it tries to cut out unnecessary issues around a problem, focus on the essentials and address relevant issues efficiently. Unilever neither encouraged nor tolerated ambiguity; in fact, the organization did all it could to distance itself from ambiguity.None‘In contrast, Tata Sons is very Indian and highly relationship-oriented. Goals are relatively fuzzy and the accountability of getting things done is not always clear. While an analytical approach is encouraged, it provides room for ambiguity and accepts the view that the problem need not be stripped to its bare bones. The space to take a more holistic view of the many related issues surrounding the task is always present.NoneNone‘To take another example, both companies have a retirement age for employees. In Unilever, there are virtually no cases of extension of employment or post-retirement advisory positions. The thinking vector of the organization dictates that since there is no uncertainty about retirement, the management had best plan succession well.‘In Tata companies, cases of retirements being deferred or advisory positions created to extend terms of employment are far more frequent. The thinking vector here states that the person possesses valuable expertise, which will not dissipate after retirement, and may work to the benefit of the competition, so why not retain such expertise for a few more years?NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneWe have so far seen the rich historical, cultural and individual influences that have shaped the Indian manager of today. To take our argument further and assess our claim that a series of factors come together in a constantly evolving way to make the made-in-India manager and thinker a force to reckon with in the future, we must first understand the forces that will shape the world of tomorrow and then situate a future made-in-India manager in this context."

The private players could also be entrusted with development/expansion of these hubs at an estimated cost of Rs 350 crore.The official further said that tender process for logistics hub at Sahibganj will happen based on a “landlord model”.“For Sahibganj, we will follow a landlord model, which will be a public-private-partnership (PPP) based landlord model… IWAI will acquire about 250 acres of land, request for which has already been filed, from the Jharkhand government… Once that land is acquired, we will lease out the land to private players, through tender process, to the highest bidder. That player will develop the hub on that land,” the official said."

content,"The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), the lobby group for the domestic pharma industry, has filed a submission to the US Trade Representative (USTR) to remove India from its Priority Watch List (PWL), which includes countries that are alleged to have weak enforcement of patent laws.IPA has drawn the attention of USTR to the rapid progress made by India on a number of fronts that were cited by the US body while placing India on PWL in 2018.The 2018 report had asserted that ‘India has yet to take steps to address longstanding patent issues’, among which were the ‘long timelines for receiving patents’.IPA, in its February 7 submission, has pointed out that a number of steps have been taken by the Patent Office to augment manpower and streamline procedures, which have resulted in the transformation of the Patent Office.As a result, patent examination time has been brought down drastically. Patents pending examination have reduced to 127,881 as on December 31, 2018 from 204,177 as on March 31, 2017, IPA said.India now examines trademark applications in about one month and registrations are completed in a year or less, the industry body added.NoneThe USTR's Special 301 report is a Congressionally-mandated annual report that has been issued every year beginning 1989. It identifies trade barriers to US companies and products in foreign shores due to the host country's intellectual property laws, including trademarks, patents, copyright and trade secrets.The US government exerts pressure on countries on its watch list to address both emerging and continuing concerns and reviews the list annually based on public hearings. The countries that continue to fail were put on priority foreign country category that mandates the US government to impose unilateral trade sanctions.NoneIndia enjoys certain trade benefits filed under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), which is a preferential tariff system extended by developed nations to developing countries.India exported about $5 billion worth of pharmaceuticals. Now, if the US imposes fresh tariff, Indian drug makers may get impacted.NoneNoneThese are additional patents for a drug with no therapeutic benefit and serve only to increase term of the patent monopoly. Consequently, the availability of affordable generics is delayed and assures innovators of an extended period of pricing monopoly.India also does not provide a term for data (market) exclusivity for a new drug, quite apart from the monopoly conferred by a patent for it.None""The extraordinarily high prices of new drugs is a cause of considerable concern globally. Even developed countries in Europe such as the Netherlands and Switzerland are exploring the possibility of compulsory licensing as a means to control prices of new drugs,"" Shah said DG Shah.IPA has strongly defended India’s patent law, which is Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)-compliant and strikes a balance between the need to assure innovators of profits for their useful inventions and safeguarding public health.IPA represents 22 leading Indian pharmaceutical companies.The body collectively accounts for over 85 percent of private sector investment into pharmaceutical R&D in India and 50 percent of the country’s pharmaceutical exports. In its submission it has urged USTR for a review of its 2019 Special 301 report.India along with 11 other countries are placed on PWL in the 2018 Special 301 report for alleged lack of a better environment for protection and enforcement of IP rights or patent. The USTR also expressed concern over lack of sufficient measurable improvements on patent protection.India was added to PWL by the US government, based on complaints of MNC drug makers, led by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) -- the US drug industry lobby  over India’s poor enforcement of IP law."

Taking over from Jose Mourinho, he has won 10 and drawn just one of his first 11 games in charge.United even moved into fourth spot on the premier league table from the earlier sixth spot with a 3-0 win over Fulham on the weekend.PSG on the other hand are struggling with injuries to two of their explosive front three.

Right-back Thomas Meunier will also be missing after suffering a concussion against Bordeaux in the league.Midfielder Marco Verratti who only just returned from a three-week injury layoff and new signing Leandro Paredes both lack match sharpness.With such a long injury list, all eyes will be on the 20-year-old World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe. Speaking ahead of the tie, PSG boss Thomas Tuchel warned against putting too much pressure on the 20-year-old winger. “It's not really his job to replace Cavani and Neymar, he can't be himself and the other two at the same time. He has to be free to play his game, play with confidence. We have to help him with the right support and good service. In my opinion he needs to play with a good mindset, be positive and realise it's part of his development,"" he said.Tuchel also hinted that United remain favourites to secure victory in front of their home fans but stressed that PSG need to remain in the game to give themselves a chance of progressing after the second leg at Paris.Solskjaer on the other hand seems assured of his side’s chances. “We've given ourselves the best possible opportunity with the way we've gone into this game because we are confident.

title,Should you take this 'bridge' to a bigger home? 
datetime,2019-02-13 17:05:00+00:00
description,"Piramal Capital lays out easy money to borrow your dream house. However, with this finance scheme you may end up buying a home bigger than your means."
content,"Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Company has launched a new home loan scheme—Bridge. This scheme is a short-term home loan especially for customers who would like to purchase a new house without immediately selling their existing house.Hence, this product basically covers the funding gap between the purchase of the new house and sale of the existing house for homebuyers as closing a deal to sell-off old home may take some time. But does it really benefit you?The schemeA bridge loan is a loan that homebuyers take to buy a new house if they already have an existing house but have put it up for sale. Once the old house gets sold, the home buyer can use this money to pay back the full bridge loan.Bridge home loan can be applied for a brand new home or a re-sale one. The tenure of the loan is two years for readily available property and five years for an under-construction property. The key here is that the home buyer must already have an existing house with herself, which she wishes to sell to fund the purchase of the new house.A bridge loan is a temporary stop-gap arrangement to help the buyer buy that dream home pending the sale of the existing one.Let’s take an example. The home buyer is presently staying in 2-bedroom-hall-kitchen (BHK) flat in Mumbai. Now, she wants to move to a bigger house—a 3-BHK flat. The market value of this new flat is Rs 30 lakh.If the home buyer cannot sell her current flat in time, but still wants to buy the new flat, she takes a bridge loan. Piramal Capital will value the old property and decide the amount of loan that the buyer can get. Say, it values the property at Rs 25 lakh and decides to give a loan of, say, Rs.22.5 lakh to her.The housing loan scheme gives two years to her to sell old flat and repay the bridge loan from sales proceeds of that old 2 BHK flat. Assuming, the home owner can garner Rs 25 lakh from the sale of the old flat, she can then use the proceeds to pay off and close the bridge loan.What worksNoneIf by the end of the loan term the buyer hasn’t yet been able to sell her old house and fails to close the bridge loan, she then needs to switch to a normal home loan from Piramal Capital and continue paying the EMIs, albeit under the new loan scheme. Or, if she can arrange cash from anywhere else and close the bridge loan.If she forecloses the bridge loan, there are no additional charges.“Most importantly, a bridge home loan gives a homebuyer a breathing space. Once you have a cushion of a bridge loan, you can wait for some time to get the best deal for your existing house,” said Deepesh Raghaw, SEBI registered investment adviser and founder of PersonalFinancePlan.According to terms and conditions of Piramal Capital’s bridge home loan scheme, if a customer cannot repay the bridge loan in time, she has to then switch the loan amount to normal housing loan from Piramal Capital or any other financial institution.What doesn’t workNone“Such home loan schemes are like a hook to catch a new loan customers,” said Sukanya Kumar, Founder & Director of home loan advisory firm, RetailLending.com.Raghaw said, “There is a possibility you may end up incurring higher cost by taking a bridge loan if you haven’t considered overall expected market returns from selling existing house and higher interest cost on the bridge loan.”If, in the above case, the home buyer took a bridge loan of Rs 22.5 lakh and assume the rate of interest is 10 percent per annum. After completing a year, she ends up selling her existing 2 BHK flat for Rs 20 lakh instead of the expected market price of Rs 25 lakh.Apart from paying interest (Rs 2.25 lakh each for two years) and principal amount (Rs 22.5 lakh), she also has to pay an additional amount of Rs.2.5 lakh (Rs 22.5 lakh of loan amount, less Rs 20 lakh of sale proceeds of old house) to bridge the gap.Besides this, there are additional costs involved in bridge home loan scheme, like any other loan, which includes processing fees, valuation and other ancillary charges.In case you opt to continue with non-banking finance company or switch to any other financial institution there is a risk of higher interest rate. With non-banking finance companies being impacted due to the ongoing liquidity crisis and borrowing money from central bank at higher rates, high interests on home loans disbursed is a possibility.Furthermore, Piramal Capital states there will be tax benefits available on bridge home loan scheme. However, experts are of the opinion it will be difficult to avail tax benefits on this scheme.Kumar explained, “Regular home loan scheme and bridge home loan scheme from Piramal Capital are two separate schemes with different tenures, moratorium period, etc. A borrower will be claiming tax benefit under regular home loan scheme for longer tenure. So, clubbing of tax benefits won’t be applicable in regular and shorter tenure of home loan scheme (i.e. bridge home loan).”NoneKumar said, “Bridge home loan scheme is a debt trap for cash trapped costumers and looking forward to buy a new home. If they are cash trapped today what is the guarantee that after the moratorium period, they will be cash rich and able to pay at the end of tenure to close bridge home loan scheme.”Moneycontrol's takePiramal Capital lays out easy money to borrow your dream house. It is an option available in the market and it’s absolutely your (customer’s) discretion to avail this offering. However, with this finance scheme you may end up buying a home bigger than your means. A bridge loan may just meet your funding gap. But if yours old property is not sold during the tenure of the loan, then you may have to end up switching to regular home loan which can be expensive with fluctuating interest rate scenario.A better way is to plan your purchases in advance and take a loan only if think you can service it comfortably."

description,"Honda, which manufactures and sells India’s best-selling two-wheeler Activa, has a portfolio of 24 models"
content,"It will be the end of the road for at least one model of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), as the company has decided against upgrading its entire product range to Bharat Stage VI (BS 6).NoneHonda, which manufactures and sells India’s best-selling two-wheeler Activa, has a portfolio of 24 models, including 19 that are fully manufactured in India and three that are partially manufactured within the country.Companies like Honda are investing only in those models in which there is some assurance of generating volumes even after moving them to the BS-VI standard.Costs are expected to rise by 10-20 percent after switching to BS-VI whose official implementation date is April 1, 2020. However, several vehicle makers will be switching to BS-VI production by January next year itself.Cliq and Navi, the two unconventional models in Honda’s portfolio, have performed poorly and failed to meet the internal targets set by the company. Given their performance, these two may face the axe if the company decides the option.Sales of Navi, a modern concept based on a moped, slipped to a nought in December after witnessing several months of decline in sales. Priced at Rs 45,300 the Navi was launched in 2016 as a fun two-wheeler aimed at the young crowd. Powered by an Activa engine, the gearless Navi is a mix of scooter and motorcycle attributes.Cliq was yet another attempt by Honda to push scooter volumes at the price of a motorcycle targeting the rural market where scooterisation has not happened at the same pace as in the urban pockets.Despite being priced Rs 10,000 cheaper than the Activa at Rs 44,900, volumes of the Cliq have remained muted. Selling more than 1,000 units a month until August, Cliq’s volumes have come down to below 200 units since October. Activa’s volumes, meanwhile, have been comfortably above Rs 2.5 lakh a month.Kato did not specify if the Cliq will get upgraded to BS-VI or not. He, however, mentioned that “the Cliq will not continue in its present form and will be seen a different form”. He did not specify the timeframe for a makeover."

title,Podcast | Sanjay Bakshi: Why you should love your investments but worry about FOMO
datetime,2019-02-13 08:26:00+00:00
description,"For the uninitiated, FOMO is fear of missing out. In investing, it can hurt you when you jump into companies without doing full research or having conviction"
content,"In Part 3 of the podcast interview with Sanjay Bakshi, value investor, behavioural finance expert at Adjunct Professor at MDI, talks about how he chooses his investments, whether technology is disrupting the concept of moat – or a company having competitive advantages over peers – and how investors should avoid value traps.NoneNoneQ: What are some of the basic rules that you follow while investing in a company and how have they evolved over the course of your investment career?A: They have evolved a lot and that applies to almost every investor. When I started practicing value investing about 25 years ago, I was purely a Graham investor. So, I was doing statistical bar games, I was doing risk arbitrage. The key source of margin of safety for me was from a low price in relation to perceived value; it could be a cash bargain, it could be high dividend paying stock, it could be a stock selling well below its net current asset. All the standard filters that Graham has spoken about in his books.So you are not paying a lot of attention to the quality of the business or the quality of the management and you are very quant-oriented and of course, that kind of a strategy will work, provided you have lots of bets. You can’t have five names, you need to have 40 names or even more.But over time, I became much more aware of the qualitative factors, management factors, softer factors, things that are hard to measure and it’s very difficult to put them in an Excel model for example. But they are very important, investing with the right kind of entrepreneur who has the right kind of skill-set and the right kind of ethics, for example, can create enormously beneficial outcomes.So over a period of time, I ended up thinking about investing in three buckets. There is a business bucket, there is a management bucket and there is a valuation bucket.In a Graham framework, the valuation bucket is of extreme importance in a sense that the management may be mediocre, the business may be very mediocre, but a low price could offset the disadvantages of having a mediocre business in your portfolio or a mediocre management running those businesses.But the process that I follow now requires me to first love the business. If I don’t love the business, there is no point thinking about the management and there is no point thinking about the valuation. If I don’t like the people who run the business, I am not going to say a low price can compensate for all that.So, yes, valuation is important and very critical but it comes after you have found a business that you love and after you have found people who run those businesses that you love.Q: So, typically how much does it take for you to research a company?A: It’s a good question and honestly, I spent six months in a stock and [and had the experience of] getting a lot of confidence and ending up with very bad outcomes. I have spent five minutes on a stock and with excellent outcomes and when I say five minutes it doesn’t mean that I just found a name and I bought that stock in the spur of the moment. Knowledge is cumulative. Sometimes you know that there is a great business out there and you haven’t bought it because it’s too expensive but you know that they are executing well and it’s a great business. But for whatever reason the stock price falls, it could be company-specific, it could be macro, it could be political, it could be anything, but it doesn’t take a lot of time for you to come to the conclusion that this is a great opportunity to be in. So, five minutes is all that it took in this one case and in another one I spent some six months and you do all the work and you collect all the data and you make a big investment memo and you have all this confidence but it kind of blows up in your face. So, yes these things happen.I don’t want to say that there is a set time that one has to spend before determining. I do want to say one thing though, which is there is this concept, which the younger generation is much more familiar with. They call it FOMO, or fear of missing out. Now when you are doing research, one of the tendencies that you have to guard yourself against is FOMO, which is that the stock will run away, and you haven’t done the work yet, and other people are buying it and the stock is going up. So, one thing, which is very hard to do but it’s worthy of learning to do is to avoid FOMO.Do the work, focus on the process - there is a process, there is a checklist for the business, there is a check list for the management, there is a checklist for valuation, finish the work. Before you finish the work, if it runs away, let it go. There will be other opportunities that will come but rushing in without finishing the work because you gave in to FOMO exactly during a bull market, for example, is likely to be very costly. I paid the price for that and I am not saying that I have become completely rational, but one of the things that I am working very hard on for myself is to get over this FOMO tendency.Q: Do you recall any instances where you spent just about five minutes on a stock and that gave you some really good returns?A: Yeah, I mean there is this company called P&G Hygiene and Health, and we know that they own the Whisper sanitary napkin franchise and it’s very easy to see that it has a great business. Now I want to mention I am not recommending this stock, I am using this just as an example and I don’t own it now. Just wanted to make the disclosure before we go further. So, here was the case when they had a couple of bad quarters and the stock fell like 40 percent and the business was excellent, was then excellent and is still excellent and it was a very simple decision.There is a famous song by Richard Marx which goes along the following line that I would be right here waiting for you. So, you know you have done the work, you already know that this is a business and you like what they do and how they are executing. What you don’t like is the valuation and then it comes. It’s come not because there has been an impairment, it’s come because there is an overreaction to something, which is not very important. A couple of bad quarters doesn’t change the value at all, in my view, in the long run.They own the Whisper sanitary napkin franchise. India is a country where you have 1.3 billion people, half of them are females and most of them don’t use sanitary pads. So there is a large market out there. This company in the branded space has more than the 50 percent of market share. So, it’s a very long runway kind of a business and they also owned Old Spice, and they own one more brand. So, it’s a three brand company and a few years ago, the stock fell to a price, which made me comfortable to own it. It was a five minute thing but there have been other situations where you spend a whole lot of time to gain conviction and then you give up because you just don’t understand it.NoneA: Firstly, the fact that I believe in the concept of moat doesn’t mean that I don’t believe in the other concepts of investing. As a teacher I teach different styles of value investing. I teach investing like Ben Graham, investing in debt restructuring for example. I don’t do debt restructuring, I don’t do bankruptcy workouts. I have done them in the past but I don’t do them anymore. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t make money there. It’s a great place to make money. I don’t do risk arbitrage anymore but I teach it.But I agree with you that the nature of moats is changing. Standard moat businesses come from either brands, they come from intellectual property, they come from network economics and they come from the low cost advantage and I feel that out of these four, there is only one, which is unchanged and is unchangeable, which is the desire for customers to pay low prices. That means that if there is a business, which can earn a reasonably good return on capital while having the lowest cost advantage -- that’s durable. If you can focus intensely on maintain your advantage, which means not getting too greedy about gross margins, not getting too greedy about your margins and trying to cut prices to the point where you are deterring competition. That sort of moat is going to stay around for a long time because I don’t think human nature is such that they would like to keep paying higher prices when the whole world starts laughing at them.Which is what happened in many cases; there are these companies, which charge very high prices for their products because they can and in the past they could. But today consumers are far more conscious about the high prices they are paying compared to alternate products that come by at much cheaper prices but with similar value propositions. One example that is often used in this context is that of Dollar Shave Club and again it’s a good example to use because Gillette was spending an enormous amount of money in R&D and they have this extraordinary gross margins. You would expect that this will last forever, but today 13 or 14% of the market share has been taken away by this company.They don’t spend a lot of money on advertising, they don’t spend a lot of money on R&D, they give a blade which is as good as any another blade and they turn it into a subscription model, which is very interesting because the subscription model is just an illustration of a point that it’s not just about technology innovation or about the other point that you made - regulatory changes that can cause moats to get eroded -- it is also business model innovation. So you have to worry about all of those things.Q: Very often, stocks that look like good bargains after having fallen sharply from their peaks, turn out to be value traps. Of course, the reason why they are also called value traps is because they are hard to spot. So, how does an investor distinguish between what’s a bargain and what’s a value trap?A: That’s a good question and I deal with this all the time in my classroom. Knowing something that is cheap is one thing, knowing that it is cheap but cheap for the wrong reasons and those reasons that are not permanent is another thing. So, the way to understand this is there is value and there are value traps. In fact, Ben Graham writes about this in his book. Towards the end of Security Analysis, there is a chapter in which he talks about certain classes of businesses - he doesn’t use the word value trap but he is implying that - he talks about holding companies.For example, we have seen holding companies, which own shares in other companies and nothing else, there is no business, there is no operating business, but they just hold shares of another company. They tend to sell at very steep discounts to the breakup values. Those shares could be sold in the market, sometime three to four times the current market value of the whole company and it’s very easy for a student of value investing to say, my god this is so cheap and therefore I should buy it. It’s cheap, we know that, that’s evident, but should you buy it? That depends on the presence or absence of a catalyst. How likely is it that that cheapness will go away? For that to happen they have to sell the shares and distribute the dividend, they have to have massive buybacks or have to liquidate the company. If none of those things are going to happen, then the probability of the value being realised is low, and that’s the important point for students to understand. That it might be cheap but if the cheapness is not going to go away for specific reasons -- could be governance, could be structural -- then it’s probably a value trap.Then there are other kinds of value traps - I do a whole series of lectures on this, giving examples over there - but one of the classic value traps is the PE (price to earning) multiple value trap that you know in a cyclical business, which is experiencing a lot of shortage and an enormous jump in the profitability of that industry. The price has gone up 5-6-10 times and the earnings have gone up even faster, the stock looks cheap because you looking on a PE multiple based on the last 12 months or the forward 12 months something like that."

Co-founder and CEO of Swiggy, Sriharsha Majety said that Swiggy aims to bring convenience to the doorstep of its customers. But, what does this mean for the company?This initiative will first be launched in Gurugram, where the company has already partnered with 3,500 stores that include retail majors like Zappfresh, HealthKart, Apollo Pharmacy. The company, valued at $3.3 billion, reportedly plans to take the initiative to all major cities once it successfully pilots in Gurugram.It is not clear yet what fee the company will charge from customers below an average ticket size order.The growing marketSwiggy has now delved into the hyper-local delivery space that is becoming one of the most attractive avenues of Indian retail market, of which 60 percent is constituted by groceries. The company will now have to compete with the likes of BigBasket, Grofers and Dunzo, along with Amazon and Flipkart.It is understandable that a growing company like Swiggy would want a share of this pie. India's online grocery market is expected to be worth between $400 billion and $600 billion presently and may reach $700 billion in the next three years, according to a report by Knowledge@Wharton. The sector has already seen a lot of activity, with Walmart's entry into the market through Flipkart, Amazon launching its delivery arm Pantry and BigBasket raising close to $300 million.How will this move fare for Swiggy?This new initiative is touted as a beneficial move by analysts. Swiggy has a strong delivery network in the country, with a strong presence in almost 80 cities. They have established themselves through food deliveries within an hour with a delivery staff of over 1.25 lakh. The company is banking upon these factors to make this a success.NoneHowever, some also believe that this would cost the company more than it brings in. Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research, believes that this service faces the challenge that everything that the customers demand, may not be available at the same grocery stores. This could mean more time and money going out from Swiggy."

The state government, in the last tripartite meeting held on January 17, had decided to give an interim relief of Rs 70, raising the workers' wage to Rs 327 per day till the new wage agreement was finalised.The unions, however, contended that the interim benefit was a unilateral decision of the state government.A former chairman of Indian Jute Mills Association, a body of mill owners, said paying anything more than Rs 327 would not be possible as ""margins are already under pressure in the jute business""."

In that sense, democratic tradition was not completely a foreign one, Deputy Indian Ambassador to the US Santosh Jha told a Washington audience on Wednesday.""India's emergence as the world's largest democracy, and perhaps the most vibrant one after the end of the second World War, is indeed exceptional,"" he said in his keynote address at a day-long seminar 'Delivering Democracy in India'.The event, attended by over 150 prominent representatives from American media, academic institutions, US agencies and think tanks, was organised by the Embassy of India in collaboration with Indian Council for Cultural Relations and prestigious Hudson Institute think-tank.""With the benefit of the hindsight of seven decades of Indian democracy, there is no doubt that democracy is perhaps the only way to natural way to govern India, given the diversity of its languages, religion, ethnicity, and culture,"" Jha said.Economist Surjit Bhalla said that only a democratic form of government can satisfy the interests of all the different sections of the society in India.""That is why democracy has succeeded in India and why it will continue to succeed, it's in the DNA.""What I see happening in India today, and it started in 2014, and it concerns (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi, is that we are having a major transformation. One example of the transformation is that Indians no longer give the excuse, and this is through Modi, no longer give the excuse that we are a democracy so we can't do it well. Now the refrain is if China can do it so can we,"" Bhalla said.Richard Fontaine, acting CEO, Center for New American Security noted that both American government officials and Indian government officials often tout the logic of close US-India ties by invoking this phrase: the bonds between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy.""We should acknowledge these differences but see where the two countries could pursue a more values-based agenda that helps democracies defend themselves against authoritarian meddling, help nurture democratic practice where its emerged, supports democrats in places that lack fundamental rights and liberties.""In a world where our competitors want to divide the democracies... we shouldn't be helping do their job for them. Too much political division is dangerous. It's not just unattractive, it's not just undesirable, but in a world where it will be used and weaponised against us it is dangerous,"" Fontaine said.Senior BJP leader from Bihar Sanjay Paswan told the audience that top leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, Dr B R Ambedkar and Deen Dayal Upadhyay have contributed immensely towards the development of democracy in India. The best of Indian democracy is yet to come, he said.""Any state government that has attempted deep reforms, with the exception in the power sector of Gujarat, that has tried deep power reforms, has been voted out of office the next election, every single time that I've seen, deep reforms,"" said Rick Rossow, senior adviser and Wadhwani Chair in US-India Policy Studies, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Observing that India presents the most compelling example, certainly in the development world, of how to grapple with the problems of modernity in a democratic and open framework, Daniel Twining, president, International Republican Institute said that the dangers to India do not emanate from the democracies.""The dangers to India, to the security of Indian people, emanate from either autocracies or mis-governed components in their neighbourhood,"" he said.Development activist Dr R Balasubramaniam told the audience that this narrative of powerful citizen engagement, very quiet subtle silent way of doing it, is indicating to the rest of the country and to the rest of the world that democracy might be noisy in India, but it is actually evolving."

content,"Today Google India is celebrating the 86th birthday of one of India’s most iconic actresses -- Madhubala, remembered for her unparalleled appeal and prowess as an actor.NoneMost fondly remembered for playing the role of Anarkali in the 1960s magnum opus Mughal-E-Azam, the starry-eyed beauty was born in Delhi on February 14, 1933, as Mumtaz Jehan Begum Dehlavi.She was raised in a town near Bombay Talkies film studio and began her career at the tender age of nine with the film ‘Basant’, earning the moniker Baby Mumtaz.NoneHer performances in movies like 'Chalti Ka Naam Gadi', ‘Neel Kamal’, and 'Mr and Mrs 55' are popular among aficionados. In her 22-year career, Madhubala starred in more than 70 films.Through her life, she had to work tirelessly to support her family, as she was the only breadwinner. She changed her name to Madhubala in 1947, on the insistence of her co-actress Devika Rani.The country also remembers the star for her tumultuous love affair with Mughal-E-Azam co-star Dilip Kumar. Just like in the movie, the star-crossed lovers couldn’t unite as parents acted as impediments.An obedient daughter, she cowered under her father’s lack of support. Though her father softened his stance later, it is said, a court case, where Dilip Kumar testified against her and her father, acted as the last straw.Allegedly, she married singer/ actor Kishor Kumar later, only to prove that she had moved on and could carry on with life without Dilip Kumar.Notably, Madhubala had caught the fancy of Hollywood big-wigs, including photographer James Burke, who came to India and photographed her for Life Magazine.The West called her the biggest star in the international film industry. Theatre Arts magazine dubbed her 'The Biggest Star in the World' in 1952. It is said that she was also offered a role by Frank Capra, but her father didn’t let her take it up.Unfortunately, though the actress won several accolades for her performance, she never won an award. Madhubala's career and life was cut short in 1969, when she succumbed to prolonged illness on February 23."

content,"None""We committed close to a $1 billion on specialty business; we have to justify that investment and produce returns,"" said Dilip Shanghvi in the company's earnings call on February 12.Sun Pharma which built its speciality business through a series of acquisitions over the years, however, pressed the pause button in FY18.""I don’ think the valuation totally reflect the underlying value of the product in the market,"" Shanghvi said.Sun Pharma has the largest pipeline of specialty drugs among Indian companies in the US, largely built on acquisitions and in-licensing products developed by promoter held Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC). The company is focusing on eye care and skin as target therapeutic areas for specialty play.The company launched two assets -- Bromsite to treat eye pain and Odomzo to treat skin cancer during FY18. Sun Pharma bought Odomzo, from Novartis paying $175 million.In the current financial year, it had launched three specialty products Yonsa, Ilumya (IL-23) and Xelpros.The company bought prostrate-cancer drug Yonsa from Churchill Pharmaceuticals, Ilumya or Tildrakizumab from Merck in 2014 for $80 million and Xelpros was in-licensed from SPARC,It's top-selling specialty drug Absorica used in the treatment of the skin condition called acne, was through Ranbaxy acquisition.Sun Pharma said the launch of the much-anticipated Cequa, is now pushed to first quarter of FY20 due to some manufacturing delays. Cequa is used in the treatment of eye infectionsThe management also said it has decided against the launch of Elepsia as it doesn’t see commercial merit in building a CNS (central nervous system) field force for a single product.The product will now be returned to SPARC.While Sun Pharma doesn't provide a break-up of its specialty business revenues, analysts estimate the sales to be around 20 percent of the company's overall US sales. Sun Pharma's US sales in FY18 was around Rs 8,746.6 crore.Kotak Securities estimates the sales of the specialty business to be Rs 4,113.8 crore or about one-third of Sun Pharma's US sales by FY21.Challenges galoreFaced with competition and commodification of generic drugs in the US, Indian drug makers such as Sun Pharma have been gradually diversifying into specialty drugs.Specialty drugs are medications that provide targeted therapy for severe, chronic and rare diseases, and are often built on incremental innovation like new delivery formulations such as patches, inhalers, topicals etc., or new disease indications or better safety profile, so they get some protection by patents and are also complex to copy, ensuring drug makers limited competition, and much better margins.But unlike generic drugs, specialty requires a lot of investment on development and commercialisation, and the payoffs hinge on a lot of factors.Companies have to invest significant time and money on clinical development, regulatory filings, brand building, front-end distribution, ensuring coverage of payers, raising sales force to motivate doctors to write more prescriptions. Since specialty drugs are not breakthrough innovations there is always a sword of a copy hanging.This is somewhat uncharted territory for Indian drug markers in the US.For instance, Sun Pharma's is competing against well-entrenched rivals Novartis, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson to gain market share of Ilumya. The three competitors also sell broadly the same class of biologic drugs like Ilumya, meant for the same disease segment.Sun Pharma's Ilumya has so far been prescribed by 800 doctors at least once. Though its early days, Sun Pharma stays optimistic.The case isn't any different for its other speciality drug Odomzo, where it is competing against Roche's Erivedge. Other speciality drugs like Absorica and BromSite are also not immune to generic competition.""There is learning involved, it is a new market, completely different from what we at Sun (Pharma) had done,"" said Abhay Gandhi, CEO of North America business for Sun Pharma.""If we didn't have confidence, we wouldn’t have invested that kind of money in creating a new business. Now that we are there, we have no options but find ways to succeed in that market. We will learn, we will make some mistakes, and we will try and get a fair share of the market,"" Gandhi added."

Income velocity of money means the frequency at which a particular unit of currency is used to purchase products. A declining velocity suggests that money is not getting adequately circulated in the economy.States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka showed income velocity less than the national average, while Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh fared on the higher side of the national average.

content,"German automobile giant Volkswagen recently revealed its Euro-spec update of the Passat. While the carmaker has not stated any plans of launching the luxury sedan in India, there are important upgrades and changes it has made to the vehicle.Here's what VW has enhanced the vehicle with:Improved driver assistsVW debuted the Travel Assist feature in the Passat, which makes driving the car partially automated at cruising speeds. It allows level 2 autonomy for speeds up to 210 kmph. It works together with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, making long hauls a little less tiring. The 2019 Passat will be the first VW to feature a capacitive steering wheel, which detects tactile inputs from the driver. Failure to maintain contact with the steering wheel for more than 10 seconds at a stretch triggers a series of alerts and if there is no response, the Passat's Emergency Brake Assist will take over and bring the car to a halt.IQ DriveVW has armed the Passat with a bunch of features clubbed under the moniker ""IQ Drive"". This includes lane change assist, lane keeping assist, emergency steering assist, park assist and trailer manoeuvring assist. It features LED matrix headlights and multi-function LED clusters for DRLs.Cabin AmenitiesTo make the Passat more intelligent, VW has introduced the MIB3 system, which allows the car to be connected to a network of services without a paired smartphone. The highlight of this feature is a ""digital butler"" AI system that can be accessed simply by saying ""Hello Volkswagen"". This allows the driver to operate navigation, the phone and radio via voice commands. The car has an updated 11.7-inch instrument cluster, which offers a wide array of information at a glance.Digital car keysForgetting car keys at home and having to rush back or make frantic calls is passé. With the ""We Connect"" interface and app, a driver can convert their smartphones into keys and can use it to unlock and start the car. The ""mobile key"" can be sent to family and friends, making it easier for them to access the car as well. This potentially eliminates the need for a physical key and diminishes the chances of having to suffer because of a lost or forgotten key.Improved engine"

content,"MoneycontrolNoneNone""Our API business is doing well, we are making around Rs 2000 crore revenue (per annum), and we emerged as one of the top-5 generic API companies. For us the next growth avenue is the formulation business,"" said Chava.Till now, Laurus has filed 18 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), of which 7 are Para-IV filings that makes it eligible for 180-days market exclusivity if it prevails in a lawsuit invalidating the patents of the originator company.The company had received approvals for diabetes drug Metformin, antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine and Tenofovir, Lamivudine,Dolutegravir (TLD)One-third of those ANDAs filed by the company are related to antiretroviral drugs used in treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, the rest are related to diabetes, cardio and oncology.ARV betARVs such as Efavirenz, Tenofovir, among others generate about two-thirds of the company's revenues. Hepatitis-C drugs (antiviral) is another area that the company has found a firm footing.With US patents for some key HIV therapies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Sustiva (Efavirenz) and Gilead Sciences Viread (Tenofovir Disoproxil) are set to expire starting from December 2018, Laurus Labs is gearing up to launch the rip-offs of those drugs.Beyond US, millions of people affected by HIV are living in Africa, Asia and Latin American countries. The market size of this segment is estimated around $1.5 billion.But much of ARVs distributed in these markets, are procured in bulk through a global tenders, and are funded by US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).To participate in those tenders funded by PEPFAR, the suppliers will have to go through USFDA approval process. This is done to ensure highest quality drugs are supplied to patients.Three combination drugs that have emerged as potent weapons in the fight against HIV/AIDs for emerging markets include TLD, Tenofovir, Lamivudine, Efavirenz (TLE) 400 and TLE600.With USFDA approval for TLD already in place, Laurus said it is expecting WHO approval by end of March for the same, and plans to file for TLE600 in October 2018 and TLE400 by January 2018.Given the backward integration, large capacities and cost efficiencies it has built over the years, Chava expects the formulation business to see cash break even in FY20.Chava also doesn’t see any funding problem, as cited by some companies.""We are talking about $75 per year or $6.25 per month to manage a something like HIV/AIDS, this is less than the cost of treating cold. HIV/AIDS became a very manageable disease funding wise,"" Chava said.South Africa that alone accounts 25 percent of world's HIV population is funding its own national AIDS control programme, by procuring drugs through floating tenders."

title,Predicting bankruptcies the Prof Altman way
datetime,2019-02-15 09:26:00+00:00
description,"In India, the Z-score model was used to identify possible bankruptcy for at least 10 companies two years before the crisis finally hit home. "
content,"RN BhaskarNoneThe model we had then developed was intended to do predict excellence in each industry (because each industry has a different set of dynamics under which it operates). It was quite the opposite of what the Z-score does which is to predict bankruptcy.Each week, we used the model to determine the best performer in an industry segment for a large publishing group. We continued this from 1990 to 1998.  Then I decided to leave the group. So did the Wharton geniuses. There was nobody left to understand the multi-variant discriminant analysis model and the exercise was scrapped.But what we discovered in the fourth year was invaluable. Over 85 percent of the industry winners had outperformed the BSE Sensex. It had become an amazing investment model as well.Prof Altman, who is Professor of Finance, Emeritus, at New York University's Stern School of Business has dedicated more than 50 years studying bankruptcy. He was in Mumbai recently, at the invitation of Assocham, to educate Indian bankers, credit rating agencies and investment managers about how the model works.  He has also developed a new model --  Z double prime.As Prof Altman puts it, “It was built in 1995… for non-manufacturers, even though it has assets among the variables it considers. We found Z double prime to be accurate for retailers. But I cannot really say it will be accurate for technology firms. However, this model is appropriate for retail, energy, services sector etc. It focusses on four variables rather than five. We eliminated the fifth variable -- ‘sales to total assets’.”None Altman is also in India to develop new models for the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector that would be both industry and region specific. As he puts it, “We have built models for the SME area in 19 European countries. We are now beginning to look at India because the need is urgent, and for the first time you have a good bankruptcy code, though it is early days yet.”He sees a big problem in data collation, though.  To develop the model, one needs a very large amount of data.A layman’s guide to Z scoreTypically, this data is divided into three clusters. One cluster would comprise around 100 companies that almost everyone agrees are good companies.  Another set would comprise a similar number of companies that people reckon are bad companies.  The rest of the companies would form the third (very large) cluster.  A regression multi-variant regression analysis is then done in order to find out how the selected ratios explain the goodness or badness of each company.  The ratios have to be tweaked till one gets a higher R square (the ratio which tells you whether the model is working well in determining the soundness of the companies). The higher the R square, the better is the way the model works.But this is not possible unless data sizes are large.That is why, explains Prof Altman, India uses this model to look at equity rather than debt.  The data size of debt instruments in India is not large. As the debt market improves, you will find a greater application of this model for ranking debt too.None“These ratings companies should be using this model more often,” he said.NoneBut, as Prof Altman warns, “In case of assets-light companies like Uber, both models will be a problem. I don’t have an answer to that. I will have to build a separate model for technology companies like Airbnb, Uber and so on. Additionally, we would need a significantly large number of such companies before we build a separate model. We would also need defaults in this space to build the new model. I love defaults and bankruptcies. Not because I am a sadist but because I get data. I have said that over years. My model will not be appropriate for firms with less assets or no assets. I cannot do anything about it. “But, as he points out, models for such sectors too will soon get developed.  Today the number of such companies is very small. We need more companies; and bankruptcies.  When bankruptcies occur, we can then analyse them better, and find out the tell-tale ratios that could have predicted the collapse.Expect Prof Altman to be in the news more often in India.The author is consulting editor with moneycontrol.com"

Candidates are most concerned about salaries. Work location and designation are the other two significant factors while negotiating a new job offer. This points to the fact that we have millennials in this group having an optimistic outlook of the job market.The factors that play a role among senior management during a job switch include salary, benefits, variable pay, designation and job role level. Candidates in mid-level roles, on the other hand, are concerned about salaries, designation and variable pay.NoneAt the entry level, candidates are most concerned about salaries. Work location and designation are the other two significant factors while negotiating a new job offer.Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services said, “With the growing demand for skilled talent, availability is a major hurdle and many companies have been forced to raise the budgets for employee compensation and benefits faster than the inflation.”The survey said talent availability, salaries and benefits have emerged as major challenges for employers this year. About 62 percent of companies said they will be using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate repetitive tasks at recruiting while 59 percent of companies are making the workplace relevant for millennials."

description,"Despite its nefarious activities, China has blocked India’s bid to get JeM chief Azhar declared as a designated ‘global terrorist’ at the United Nations (UN)."
content,"Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) on February 14 claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb blast on a CRPF convoy in Awantipora, Pulwama. At least 40 jawans were martyred.The terrorist outfit, led and founded by the notorious Masood Azhar, has been responsible for some of the most dastardly terror attacks in India, including the attack on the Indian Air Force Base in Pathankot in January 2016 and the attack on Parliament in December 2001.Despite its nefarious activities, China has consistently blocked India’s bid to get JeM chief Azhar declared as a designated ‘global terrorist’ at the United Nations (UN).On the record, China has condemned the attack in Pulwama, with spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Geng Shuang telling mediapersons, ""We firmly oppose and strongly condemn all forms of terrorism. We hope relevant regional countries will cooperate to cope with the threat of terrorism and jointly uphold regional peace and stability.""However, off the record, China has refused to end its “technical hold” on the ban on Azhar, blocking India’s attempts to declare him a “global terrorist”, twice this year alone.NoneWhen did India’s attempt to ban Azhar start?The most recent effort began after JeM claimed responsibility for the attack on the Air Force Base in Pathankot. India demanded that Azhar be declared a global terrorist under the aegis of the UNSC (United Nations Security Council) 1267 committee. China, which is one of the five permanent members and hence has the power to veto, intervened at Pakistan’s behest and stalled the process in the garb of a “technical hold” in March 2016 and then in October 2016. A day before the technical hold ended, China used its veto power to block the proposal banning Azhar in December 2016.In January 2017, China again employed a technical hold and blocked the proposal put forward by the US, the UK and France, three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.Azhar was released by the A B Vajpayee government in December 1999, along with Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and Omar Sheikh, in exchange for release of the passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight IC-814.Why is China supporting Masood Azhar?China and Pakistan are believed to be 'all-weather friends', and Beijing often views New Delhi as a competitor and, even a threat. Supporting Azhar could be a way to needle India and appease Pakistan.Besides, China and Pakistan share a quid pro quo relationship, representing each other in official groups of nations where the other has a scarce representation. For instance, Pakistan stands up for China in Non-Aligned Movement (where Beijing has a scanty representation) and in return, Pakistan gets China’s veto power in the UNSC.None"

The benchmark Sensex declined 0.19 percent to 35,808.95 points.The Bachupally plant that makes formulations including injectable drugs was audited by two USFDA inspectors Angela Glenn and Cheryl Clausen for 10 days ending February 8.At the end of the inspection, the agency issued 11 observations on Form 483 outlining certain procedural deficiencies in quality, production and facilities and equipment systems.Out of 11, four were repeat observations, earlier pointed out by the agency in its 2017 inspection, while one observation goes back to the 2015 inspection.Moneycontrol saw a copy of the Form 483.The four repeat observations are: the quality control unit lacking authority to review production records; appropriate controls not exercised over computers or related systems to assure that changes in master production and control records are instituted only by authorised personnel; the procedures applicable to the quality control unit not in writing and fully followed; and laboratory controls not including a determination of conformance to written specifications for in-process materials.Some of the other observations are related to inadequate investigations of out of specification (OOPs) and employees not following procedures or not being trained for ongoing upgrades.Three observations are related to facility and equipment systems, includes the need for adequate lab space and lack of valves in drains to prevent back-siphonage.Dr Reddy's will have to respond to the observations with a preventive and corrective action plan in 15 days from the receipt.Analysts said the clearance may take time.“While the observations by themselves would have been procedural given the high number of investigations cited and repeat observations, remediation will take time, in our view,” said Jeffries in its research note.“The company's response to the letter would be the key. We have seen multiple cases where the FDA has noted the company response and correction plan before deciding on a measure, and we believe this will be the case here. We believe that re-inspection or approval delay is likely. In any case, we believe that the latter highlights the need for further training in quality,” Jeffries added."

description,Volvo will be three new plug-in hybrid due to launch in three years
content,"Swedish luxury car brand Volvo recorded a 30 percent growth in 2018, the best in its peer group. However, replicating the performance in 2019 may not be easy, said Charles Frump, Managing Director, Volvo Cars India.NoneExcerpts:Q: 2018 was a very good year for Volvo with a growth of 30 percent. How do you see 2019?A: Looking back at 2018, of course, it was very gratifying to see the results. There were a lot of headwinds – the aftermath of GST, credit tightening – the industry was very tough in 2018. The product drove success for us in addition to opening several dealerships. I do see 2019 being a very tough year for the luxury car industry and it is unlikely to grow. We will be happy to perform the level we are at in 2019.Q: Volvo sold 2,638 units in 2018. Do you think you can hit 3,000 in sales in 2019? General elections are also round the corner.A: It is hard to say at the moment. If we are able to sell the number of cars we sold this year we will be happy with that. There is a high level of uncertainty and our customers respond to that. They want to see what is going to happen and uncertainty is never good for the business.Q: You don’t see any taxes going down?A: Just prior to the Budget was the reduction in import duty for electric vehicles. When this happened I immediately contacted Sweden. Because this is a possible game-changer for us from a business case perspective. This is something we are very grateful and happy to see because this can speed up the implementation of bringing EVs to India.Q: Volvo has promised the launch of four plug-in hybrid vehicles in three years. Could you please share more details? A: The biggest step for us is that we are going to be the first manufacturer to build plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) in India. That will be followed by a series of PHEVs. At the moment though, there is not any government support for it. And Volvo believes the road to full electrification goes through plug-in hybrids. So we are doing all we can to build awareness about hybrids.Q: So, is the S60 sedan coming next year?A: Yes, S60 petrol and PHEV will be coming to India next year. This is a very big global launch alongside the V60 in some markets not so much for India. The S60 will be launched in 2020 in India.Q: Has credit availability been a concern in recent months?A: Absolutely. The tightening of credit has led to some disruption in our industry especially in Delhi where it is very tight. Banks, perhaps rightly so, have tightened credit lines. We just need a little time to adjust to that. It is an industrywide concern with all our dealers.Q: You added six dealerships last year. How many would be added this year?"

title,Opinion | Why the Kisaan Samman Nidhi Yojana will not be effective
datetime,2019-02-14 13:02:00+00:00
description,"The design of the scheme is incongruous with the objective of supporting low income farmers, and even in states with decent land record systems, it is incapable of implementation without significant leakages."
content,"Bhargavi ZaveriUnder the PM Kisaan Samman Nidhi Yojana Scheme, the government proposes to pay an annual sum of Rs 6,000 to 12 crore small and marginal farmer families. The operational guidelines released last week spell out the design of the scheme.Leaving aside the political motivations underlying the scheme, most commentary on the scheme has either bemoaned the paltry support of Rs 500 per month or critiqued the poor state of land records for identification of beneficiaries under the scheme. This article makes two arguments. First, that even if the per-family allocation under this scheme were to be increased, the design of the scheme is incongruous with the objective of supporting low income farmers. Second, even in states with decent land record systems, the scheme is incapable of implementation without significant leakages.The scheme envisages income support to every “family comprising of husband, wife and minor children who collectively own cultivable land up to 2 hectare as per land records of the concerned State/UT”. There is a laundry list of exclusions — institutional land holders, families having at least one member of a “higher income status”, such as a practising chartered accountant, doctor or lawyer, persons who hold or have ever held a government job or a constitutional post, are some of them. Beneficiaries will have to self-declare that they do not suffer from any of the exclusions, and persons who incorrectly declare themselves as such, will be punished by law.Issues of fairnessThere are several issues of fairness associated with the identification of beneficiaries under the scheme. The operational guidelines clarify that existing land records will be used for the identification of the beneficiary-owners. A typical land revenue record evidencing the title to a land parcel will show three classes of persons who could, given the objectives of the scheme, be potentially deserving of farm income support — the owner, the occupant and the cultivator. In such cases, the cultivator or the occupant is most likely to be the farmer. Practices such as share-cropping, where the farmer is a tenant and shares a part of the crop-produce with the landlord, are common in India. It is unclear why in such cases, the owner of the land parcel and not the actual farmer should be entitled to the benefit.The complexity and unfairness of identification is exacerbated where there are multiple owners of the same land parcel, a phenomenon fairly common in India. For example, in 2017, researchers at the Finance Research Group at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR) undertook a study aimed at understanding the accuracy of digitised land records. In a pilot survey covering two districts in Maharashtra, they found that 62% of the land parcels studied had more than one owner, and 24% of such parcels had more than five owners per parcel. The operational guidelines of the scheme state that in cases of jointly-held land, the cash support would be credited to the bank account of the joint owner “with highest quantum of landholding”. While splitting the cash benefit among the owners would be virtually negating any potential utility of it, the person with the highest quantum of landholding is less likely to need farm income support, relative to a person whose farm holdings are smaller.Similarly, exclusion of families with at least one perceived high income earner gives rise to questions such as whether the professional contributes to the farming activity and whether the income of the professional is utilised to support the purchase of farm inputs. Answers to these questions are not static, may vary from family to family, and for the same family, from time to time.Issues of identificationSecond, there are serious issues of identification of the beneficiaries included and those excluded. Currently, the identification is left to the states and union territories. In a statement to the press, the government claimed that through the Agriculture Census (2015-16), “every ‘Khesra’ of the plot of the land in the country has been counted”, land parcels have been grouped into different categories depending on their size, and all that is left is connecting the holdings to the family entitled to the direct benefit transfer (DBT). However, a review of the methodology used by the agriculture census will show that for at least 12 states in which land records are not well maintained, the data on land parcel size is obtained not through village-level land records, but through sampling surveys, which cover 20% of the villages “in each block”. Consequently, the utility of the agriculture survey data for targeting welfare benefits, is suspect. It is one thing to use sampling surveys to understand averages, quite another to create vested legal rights.Similarly, it is unclear whether self-declaration will be an effective tool for the purpose of exclusion, especially for high income earners or professionals.The scheme also does not take into account the dynamic nature of asset ownership, as it lays down February 1 as a cut-off date for determining the eligibility of beneficiaries, and stipulates that no changes after this date will be considered for the next five years, except where the land ownership changes owing to succession. Updating land records to reflect the change in ownership involves considerable delays depending on the administrative capacity of the tehsil that the parcel is located in.The IGIDR study finds that even in a district with considerably high levels of digitisation, the time lags range from an average of 85 days for changes attributable to sale transactions to 110 days for inheritance-related changes. It is unclear how beneficiaries will be identified if the records are not updated or during the time-lag involved in the updating. Equally, the scheme assumes a constant number of land parcels and owners for a period of five years, which will naturally lead to exclusions.Even for states where the land records have been digitised, they need not accurately reflect the reality on the ground. The IGIDR study finds that half of all the land parcels physically measured showed a deviation of more than 20% of the area mentioned in the land records. Since the eligibility criteria are directly linked to the size of the land parcel, such discrepancies may lead to leakages and over-inclusion as the actual land under occupation may exceed that reflected in the records.ConclusionThe objective of a 'farm income support' scheme should be to support farmers whose income is insufficient for their sustenance, much less productive farming. For this reason, linking this scheme to land ownership is counter-intuitive. Moreover, the complexity of identification of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries and depending on the edifice of a weak land records administration system, is likely to cost the Centre more than the estimated outlay of Rs 75,000 crore (translating to about 0.4% of the GDP)."

content,"Shabbir KayyumiThe Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) indicator provides an interesting alternative to other popular indicators. It is developed by Australian trader Daryl Guppy, the GMMA implements 12 different exponential moving averages (EMAs) in an effort to analyze market behavior on multiple levels.What is a ‘Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA)’?NoneConstruction of GMMA IndicatorFigure .2.Construction of GMMA IndicatorThese twelve moving averages are all plotted on a chart where traders can look at fractal repetitions.Working of GMMAThe relationship within each of these moving averages groups indicate following points.• One should not use it as a simple moving average crossover tool.Advantages• It follows ‘Trend is the best friend’ principle of trading.Disadvantages• One need to follow trading system of GMMA entirely rather using it just like another indicator.Trading Technique:GMMA CrossoverFigure .3.GMMA Crossover Buy & Sell SignalsGMMA Laddering Trading TechniqueA change in price direction that is well supported by both short and long term investors signals a strong trading opportunity. It can be applied to both long side and short side. It can be applied to intraday trading as well as for longer term investment style analysis.Laddering trading technique is simply adding position at every support taken by short group near or around long group of moving averages. It follows simply ‘Trend is my friend’ principle and helps in following the main trend. Add long position whenever short moving averages group gives bullish crossover within its all moving averages whenever it is near or inside long group while long group is rising and in buy mode. It can be used in both uptrend as well as downtrend; however it is more useful while adding long position in portfolios. This technique is used by many portfolio managers worldwide.Figure .4.GMMA Indicator Ladder SignalsLaddering is most useful for trend trading on daily time frame.Conclusion• Together with Guppy, price action, and heikin-ashi charts can help traders identify and capture trending markets.The author is Head - Technical & Derivative Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors."

title,The intriguing tale of an actor who mastered the art of options trading
datetime,2019-02-16 08:02:00+00:00
description,"A clear outlier -- an actor who is a successful options trader, Shiv Darshan trades a multiple option  strategies, some of which are unconventional in India."
content,"Shishir AsthanaActors are generally associated with flamboyance and flippancy, but rarely for their money management skills. But when you do find an artist who is a pro at options trading, it could seem like a fictional character coming out of a storybook.Nonetheless, we did manage to lay our hands on one such actor who has been trading the options market since 2013 with the same dexterity as any professional. When he is not dancing around trees or beating up villains for the cameras, Shiv Darshan is striving to become a better trader.A health freak who once weighed 110 kilos, Shiv also exercises his mind through meditation. An avid reader and traveller, Shiv comes from a family that has been in the film business for two decades.Unlike most options traders, Shiv mostly trades multiple strategies with a set of conditions for picking up the strategies. But, Shiv points out, his uniqueness comes from his management of risk.In an interview with Moneycontrol, Shiv Darshan talks of his journey from facing a camera to facing a trading screen.Q: An actor and an options trader, what’s the story here? A: My family is into films for nearly two decades but we have also been discussing the financial market on our dinner table occasionally. Though I was only a listener in those early days, my baptism with markets happened in New York where I was studying acting at a time when the financial world was collapsing. I had a front-row seat of the turmoil happening at the epicenter of the financial meltdown.It was during this time that a friend of mine who was trading options told me that I can double or triple my money in a short period of time, even in this market. Since I was fascinated with the financial market, given my educational background in commerce and my time with friends who were brokers, I lent him an ear.I was sold to the idea of doubling or tripling my money in a few days. This friend gave me a crash course in options, which basically meant I could now differentiate between a call and put. I took my first trade within the next 2-3 days after being introduced to the concepts.This was buying a put option on a stock – a deep out-of-the-money (OTM) option which doubled in the next few days. This was the worst moment in my trading career. After this, beginners luck hit me. I traded recklessly over the next few months.My epiphany moment came with a long strangle trade I took on a company just before its results announcement. Even though the stock moved in my direction, I was in a loss. It was then I realised that there is more to options than simple moves.Q: What about your acting school during this time?A: Studying acting was on all along. I finished studying acting and film making in New York, but even while I was studying I used to follow markets. After returning to India, I acted in two movies, content of which have done very well in the digital space. I am still into acting but at the same time, I have dug my heels deeper in the financial markets.Thanks to the extensive learning during my initial years, I now need lesser time for my options trades. I monitor my trade for about five minutes during the day and late in the evening, I spend around the same time to do what-if analysis of my positions and new trade that I might take. I invest less than 15 minutes a day on the markets. But this has been achieved after putting in long hours to learn the craft.Q:  What did you do after realising that you lost money despite being right?A: What intrigued me to look further was the reason behind my loss despite the stock giving a strong move. I then dug deep and found that the option Greeks were the culprit. I studied extensively, attended lectures and seminars, saw as many videos as I could lay my hand on the subject, spoke to traders in the US to soak myself on the subject.I have been in touch with trainers like John Locke and Dave Thomas who have helped me clear my doubts.During the initial years I also studied technical analysis – Elliot Waves to start with and then Neo waves. After I came back to India, I cleared the exchange related certification exams to test my knowledge on the subject.In the course of my reading, I chanced upon a book – Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. What struck me was that traders were taking high probability trades and winning in the market for years, but all it took was one Black Swan event to wipe out their profits. This was the core of my trading style which is essentially taking high probability trade but with good risk management in place.Q: Why did you move from technical analysis based trading to Greeks-based option trading?A: In technical analysis, since they are directional trades, I have only a 33 percent chance of winning. The stock can either go in my trading, which is when I make money; or stay at the same place – here I am better off keeping the money in the bank or if the stock goes down and I can lose money.While in options trading, especially options writing based trades which I do, I make money if the stock moves in my direction or stays at the same place. It was a no-brainer; I doubled my chances of winning by moving to options.This, however, is not to demean technical analysis, which on its own has been profitable to many traders. For me, given my passion for movies, options trading suited my personality and my time schedule.Q: Can you tell us about the process behind the strategies you trade?A: As mentioned earlier, the basic premise of my trading is to take high probability trades with good risk management. Actively managing risk is my USP.All my trades are hedged, my overall position is hedged and my option Greeks are hedged to provide maximum safety.I have a set of six strategies that I trade every month. Every strategy is chosen based on the implied volatility (IV) and tweaked as and when the Greeks tell me to.I am basically a positive theta trader (option seller who gains from the deterioration of option value with time). My strategies are resilient to huge market moves in either direction. In fact, one of the six strategies that I take benefits from a huge Black Swan event.I mainly trade the Nifty though I have a strategy for the weekly Bank Nifty too. I normally take a trade 30-45 days before expiry, but if IV is high I might take a trade 45-60 days before expiry.My targets for the strategy is anywhere between 1.5-3 percent a month while my losses are pegged at around 1.5-2 percent.After I enter a trade I continuously monitor my position and tweak or modify them as and when necessary.Choice of my strategy depends on the IVs. In a high IV scenario, I chose strategies that benefit from short Vega (benefits when volatility shrinks) while during low IV times I am more skewed towards long Vega (benefits from an increase in volatility) strategies.If India VIX is around 18 I will have 60 percent short Vega strategies in my portfolio and 40 percent long Vega. When it is low, say around 11-12 I am 60 percent long Vega and 40 percent short Vega. In case of around 21-22, I may increase my short Vega trades to a maximum of 65 percent. But I am out of the market if IV goes above 26.I am always a net seller or always a positive theta trader.Q: Can you walk us through your strategiesA: My first strategy is the conventional Iron Condor, but I take a low probability, Iron Condor, where the short strikes are at 20 deltas (probability of the strike being hit is around 20 percent). This enables me to get sufficient credit resulting in higher yields. The long side of the Iron Condors will be 2-3 strikes away from the short strike point. These generally depend on my view of the IVs. I generally have two condors on – current month and the next month.Where my trading style differs is in the adjustments. I am ready to take around half a dozen adjustments if the situation so demands.Let’s take a case where the market falls and India VIX is around 15 when I initiated the position. Because of the fall, the VIX will rise. As it moves above 15 I will buy debit spreads on the side which is attacked to adjust my position to negate downside risk rather than buy long puts.I will also reduce my position from say 10 lots to 3 lots, thus reducing my delta exposure.If the market continues to fall and breaks through a support level I will convert my Condor into a butterfly by squaring off my call side. But if the market reverses I will not shy away to reconvert it to an Iron Condor.My adjustments start when the deltas of the short strike increase by around 7-10 points. I take three adjustments but if Nifty goes 100 points away from my short strike I will close my position. Instead, I will double the size and take a credit spread.If the stop is not hit then I am out of the trade either if the expiry is seven days away or my profit target of 3 percent is achieved. With the increase in margins recently the profit margin has come down a bit and so is my risk.If I take the trade 40 days before expiry, then the holding period on an average is 20 days.I also make adjustments when the trade is in profits to reduce the risk and protect my profit.I lean a bit short delta as this is a Short Vega trade to reduce my Vega risk.The second strategy is a Delta Neutral Butterfly.It is basically a broken wing butterfly taken behind the market. It is a risk-averse strategy that is resilient to huge market moves on either side.There are two set-ups depending on where the IVs are. The motive is to maintain a really flat T+0 line without deploying additional capital to the trade. I have pre-defined Delta and Vega guidelines - whenever they are met adjustments are made in the trade.Drawdowns in the strategy are very less – last year it gave two loss trades of 1-1.3 percent while the winners yielded 2-2.5 percent.Adjustments typically could be shifting long and short options, buying verticals, rolling the entire spread to be slightly short delta or as close to delta neutral as possible. This strategy is ideal for huge capital.The third strategy I call it Long Vega 1. This is basically a calendar spread with my risk management principal. Here I initiate a calendar spread which is little OTM. In this strategy, I hedge the Greeks by taking a long Delta position against long Vega.If the market moves a lot in any direction I follow it like a centipede. If Nifty moves by 150 points either up or down I will make an adjustment and shift few of my original calendar spreads to a new strike price OTM. The great thing about this trade is that you are in an out really fast. So if you have taken a trade 30 days to the expiry of the short strikes you are going to be out within 12 days.The fourth strategy is Long Vega 2 which can be traded in all IV environments. It is the most adaptable strategy in my kitty. It can be traded as a standalone strategy and as a hedge for a low IV Iron Condor.Here the structure is a short strangle near month and a long strangle for the next month. This could be a debit or credit spread depending on the IVs and selection of the long strikes.The next strategy is known as Triplets.I scale into the trade by initiating an OTM Put Butterfly and follow the market by creating a new position every time the market goes up by 150 points. I do this till there are three Put Butterflies in place. Now if the market again goes ahead I will take the first one out and create the fourth one.This way there is a maximum of three Butterfly positions. This trade is taken 30-40 days before the expiry and works well in bearish, neutral and moderate bull markets. The only time this doesn’t perform at par is in an out and out a bull run without any pullbacks.The great thing about this trade is am not worried about my risk on the downside and only focusing on the upside risk. It gives me a huge range on the upside skewing the probabilities in my favour of emerging a winner.Finally, the last strategy is a Ratio Condor with a Delta Neutral Structure. This strategy, as discussed earlier, benefits from a Black Swan event or a huge gap down opening. In case the market goes up by say around 3-5 percent my maximum loss would be 0.5 percent or lesser.Of course, black swan events are rare and such anomalies don’t happen on a daily basis- so we have a Delta Neutral Structure where we make money within a range.I scale into my position. The good part of this strategy is that 15 days into the trade if the market is in the range, I am sitting in a position with no loss, I am basically playing with market’s money. This condition lasts until seven days before expiry by when I close my position.Q: What about the Weekly Bank Nifty strategy you mentioned earlierA: I allocate a small capital for this strategy. Here I initiate a trade on the Bank Nifty on Friday afternoon. It is a Ratio Butterfly trade but requires me to have a view on the market.If I have a bearish view and I create a position, I will be collecting theta for Saturday and Sunday. If the market opens on Monday around Friday closing levels I will be up by less than one percent. But if it opens lower as per my expectation I will be up by 1.2 percent. Only in case if the market gaps up on Monday by say 3.5 percent I would be losing 1 percent.I can then decide to either square off my position or make risk management adjustments, which would be rolling out my position to new strikes of the same expiry.I square of this trade latest by Tuesday afternoon. My sweet spot in trade is when on Tuesday the market is 1.5 to 2 percent against the spot price at which the trade was initiated. At my sweet spot, I would be at least 2-2.5 percent up.Q: How did movies help you in trading or how did trading help you in your movie career. A: Both fields are completely different but there is a tinge of similarity.With both trading and acting there is a certain kind of risk that keeps you on the edge. We put our heart and soul into a project, anticipating the outcome and hoping for fruitful results.Although I must say, with time I’ve come to realise that if we understand the economics of the business in which we are engaged, there is no “real” risk. Because ultimately it’s how you tackle the situation and make the most of it.I think options trading has made me more fearless and confident as an individual. It has taught me to be more patient in this fast-paced world where we look for instant results. But like they say if you want to learn anything great, patience is key. We need time to achieve our goals, especially big goals. So the key here with my strategies is the right skills and patience.Gaining knowledge and educating yourself in the field of interest is essential, which is why I came up with this one of a kind mentoring session to guide other people to trade options in the most risk-averse way.It is an initiative that I have recently started through powertechfunds.com where I mentor future traders. It is a one-on-one personalise mentoring program where I share my strategies in the live market and teach my risk management approach."

description,"The company’s total count for number of screens stands at 64 screens, including six in Bahrain and 10 under its joint venture with Asian Cinemas"
content,"Media company Mukta Arts announced its third quarter results for FY19 on Wednesday and reported a consolidated net loss at Rs 2.8 crore against loss of Rs 3.2 crore. The company’s consolidated revenue grew 33.2% year-on-year from Rs 30.5 crore to Rs 40.7 crore.The two key businesses of the company, exhibition and education, reported strong revenues in the third quarter, the company said.Talking to Moneycontrol about Mukta A2 Cinemas’ (subsidiary into exhibition business) performance in the third quarter of FY19, Rahul Puri, Managing Director, Mukta Arts, said better box office performance boosted growth in Q3.NoneThe company reported better footfall in Q3 FY19 as compared to third quarter in 2018.In terms of food and beverage business, Puri said the F&B controversy over allowing outside food in cinema halls did not have a large impact on the company. “We moved our pricing in Q2 sort of in-line with some of the government regulations. I think by and large we did not have any negative impact in Q3,” he added.In FY19, Mukta added two screens in Billai, one screen in Shamshabad, two screens in Suncity and three in Kareemnagar.“We are likely to open 15-20 screens by December. Hopefully, that should take us up to close to about 80-85 screens overall,” said Puri.The company’s total count for number of screens stands at 64 screens, including six in Bahrain and 10 under its joint venture with Asian Cinemas.Mukta A2 Cinemas is betting on the southern market which, according to experts, has been consistent in delivering content. Puri said, “South remains to be an important market not just for Mukta but for the industry as a whole as there is very robust occupancy in the market.”He added that the company will continue to focus on high-quality properties in the South. “We want to expand to places like Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru,” he said.As for the reduction in GST on movie tickets, Puri said, “It has a net positive impact but we have to wait for six to eight months to quantify the impact of rate reduction.”None“There is a good strong fleet leading up to the end of financial year and I expect Q4 will follow the momentum that Q3 has set and continue that momentum till the end of financial year,” said Puri."

title,The stump mic conundrum: Why are cricketers ruffled?
datetime,2019-02-15 18:25:00+00:00
description,"“When there is inconsistent use of the stump mic, then there is potential for selective use."" said FICA head Tony Irish. "
content,"During the International Cricket Council's (ICC) annual conference in July 2018, a decision was taken to broadcast the stump mic audio at any time, including when the ball is dead. The move was a part of ICC's efforts to combat misbehaviour on the part of players with new offences such as personal abuse and audible obscenity added to the code of conduct.The ICC also hoped to increase fan engagement with the use of stump mics helping fans at home to get a feel of the atmosphere.However, since its inclusion in live broadcast, the use of stump mics has received mixed reviews from international cricketers. When India toured Australia towards the end of last year, the audio from the stumps captured some hilarious banter between Rishabh Pant and Australian skipper Tim Paine. Paine invited Pant to his hometown of Hobart, taunting him about his exclusion from the ODI squad while asking if he has any babysitting experience. Pant in turn replied by introducing Paine as the first ever ""temporary captain"" when it was the Australian skipper's turn in front of the wickets.NoneHowever, all the chatter caught on the mic has not been so benign. On January 22, Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was heard telling South African player Andile Phehlukwayo in Urdu, ""Hey black guy, where’s your mother sitting today? What [prayer] have you got her to say for you today?""While South African captain Faf du Plessis said that the team forgave Ahmed for his rash comments, the ICC didn't take such a benevolent stance and responded by slapping a four match ban for breaching the Anti-Racism Code.Even more recently, West Indies fast bowler Shannon Gabriel was in the spotlight during the third Test match against England. In this particular incident the original comment by Gabriel was not captured but the stump mic picked up England captain Joe Root's response, ""Don't use it as an insult. There's nothing wrong with being gay.""That kicked off an investigation during which the ICC found Gabriel guilty of personal abuse and subsequently banned him for four ODIs. Gabriel accepted the charges and while Root abstained from revealing what was said, Gabriel himself revealed what transpired between the two.He said: ""The exchange occurred during a tense moment on the field. The pressure was on and England’s captain Joe Root was looking at me intensely as I prepared to bowl, which may have been the usual psychological strategy with which all Test cricketers are familiar. I recognise now that I was attempting to break through my own tension when I said to Joe Root: ‘Why are you smiling at me? Do you like boys?' His response, which was picked up on the microphone, was: 'Don't use it as an insult. There's nothing wrong with being gay.' I then responded, 'I have no issues with that, but you should stop smiling at me.'""NoneNone“The issue to be discussed is how they are used, including when they are turned up and when they are turned down,"" said Irish. ""What I can say is that, when it comes to a matter such as this, players are generally in favour of consistency, which suggests to me that a protocol on how they are used is necessary.”Speaking about the potential for a host broadcaster to use the stump mic feed against touring nations, he said: ""When there is inconsistent use of the stump mic, then there is potential for selective use, which I think players naturally fear. That is not to say all broadcasters do that but the potential and opportunity is there.""Even England coach Trevor Bayliss has expressed dissatisfaction about the way stump mics are being used as he explained, “Sometimes in the heat of battle things are said.”NoneWhile the use of stump mics has divided cricket fraternity, yet the fact remains that players aren't happy with the way the technology has been utilized thus far. Speaking on behalf of the players, Irish reiterated his request for consistent protocol in the application of the stump mic saying it was essential in order to help players still approach the game with the right spirit."

title,Asus Zenfone Max 2 review: Performance-driven budget smartphone with excellent battery life
datetime,2019-02-15 18:06:00+00:00
description,Performance driven smartphone with a stellar battery life.
content,"2018 was a great year for Taiwan-based smartphone maker Asus. With the launch of runaway hits such as the flagship killer smartphone Zenfone 5Z, gaming powerhouse ROG phone and budget performer Asus Zenfone Max M1, the company had a solid start in the year. With the launch of Zenfone Max 2 in December, it ended the year the same way it started.Asus Zenfone Max 2 has been launched in 3GB/32GB and 4GB/64GB variants and has been priced at Rs 8,999 and Rs 10,999 respectively. At the price point, Zenfone Max 2 competes with the likes of Realme 1, Redmi Note 5, Realme 2, Samsung Galaxy M10, just to name a few.Here's a review.DesignNoneZenfone Max M2 sports a metallic rear panel bound by a plastic frame. The matte finish on the metal not only gives the device a premium look but it also feels very solid and comfortable in the hand. Another advantage of the matte finish is, the rear panel attracts very few fingerprints, as a result users can spare those bulky-looking back covers.NoneAt the front, Max M2 sports a notch display with a fairly large chin at the bottom. While the left side holds the SIM tray which has slots for two nano-SIM cards and a dedicated slot for microSD card, placed at the right side is the volume rocker and the power key. Meanwhile, the top panel houses the 3.5mm headphone jack and at the bottom there is the microUSB port along with the loudspeaker and mic.NoneThe fingerprint sensor is placed at the rear and is positioned perfectly for the finger to reach and unlock the phone quickly. The dual cameras are positioned vertically on the top left side of the phone above the LED flash. As far as comfort is concerned the device scores high, thanks to its rounded edges and corners.DisplayZenfone Max M2 sports a 6.3-inch IPS LCD notched-display with 19:9 screen aspect ratio and resolution of 1520 x 720p. Surprisingly, Asus does not incorporate Corning Gorilla Glass protection into Zenfone Max 2, which makes the screen vulnerable to scratches and breaks. Using a good-quality screen guard is highly recommended.The display tends to be slightly on the warmer side when it comes to colour temperature. However, this can be changed in the display settings. The screen is bright, even in outdoor conditions with deep and punchy colours. Images and videos look sharp, vivid and crispy. However, the lack of a higher resolution panel is felt more often than not. It is also important to note the device could only play Youtube videos at 720p.PerformanceZenfone Max 2 comes powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor, which is a major overhaul compared to its predecessor Zenfone Max 1, which sports Snapdragon 430 CPU. The CPU, backed by 3GB/4GB RAM, handled most operations thrown at it with ease.The device did not show any signs of either lagging or heating while multi-tasking or during prolonged sessions of moderate usage, which included calling, browsing and streaming Youtube videos over Wi-Fi.When it came to heavy gaming, we tested graphically intensive games such as PUBG, Asphalt 9, Sniper 3D on the Max 2. The device ran these games surprisingly smoothly and fluidly, given its modest configuration.While the device could handle most games at peak settings, games running on high frames-per-second (fps) Asphalt 9 and PUBG had to be run on low settings. But that part can be ignored as we have to once again remember Max 2 is a budget device and not gaming or a flagship smartphone.Coming to the UI, Max 2 runs on stock Android based on Android 8.1 Oreo. The UI is simple, clean and easy to understand. However, the device does come pre-loaded with third-party software such as Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, etc. Since the smartphone runs on stock Android, Max 2 users will receive Android updates and security patches before its rivals who run on customised Android skins.Asus Zenfone Max 2 sports a dual rear-camera setup with a 13MP primary camera with aperture of f/1.8 and 2MP secondary depth sensing lens. At the front the device sports an 8MP sensor with aperture of f/2.0 and an LED flash for selfies in low-light conditions.NoneNonePictures clicked by the primary camera came out really crisp and clean in well-lit conditions. The primary camera duo captured sharp images with stellar details and very less noise. Portrait mode photos came out well balanced with the camera doing a good job in capturing the subject’s edges accurately while blurring out the background. However, in low-light conditions, the camera struggled and missed out on a lot of details. The camera also struggled with focussing in dark conditions and we were left waiting most of the time. 4K videos captured on the device came out quite sharp and focussed and stable thanks to EIS.The 8MP front camera captured clear selfies. As mentioned, the front camera is accompanied by an LED, housed in the notch, letting the phone capture bright selfies even in low light conditions such as outdoors in the evening or parties, etc.Battery lifeZenfone Max 2 packs in a large 4000 mAh Li-Ion battery. The battery life on this device is stunning, to say the least. The device was able to sail through the day with ease under normal use, with more than 33 percent juice still left in the tank. However, battery drainage was heavy during intense gaming sessions. But still we could easily squeeze out a day’s battery life before the phone had to be charged again.

content,"The nations largest lender State Bank has begun a massive employee engagement programme to ensure its 2.6 lakh-strong staff does not work mechanically and is sufficiently motivated to take on newer challenges that the future will throw up, a top official has said.The programme, christened Nayi Disha or the new path, focuses on work-life balance and also involves the staffs immediate family members, also giving them the ability to inform the bank if an employee is not able to leave work on time.We realised that over a period of time, our employees, especially the ones in branches, had started to work mechanically which could have an impact on customer service and also their morale, Prashant Kumar, deputy managing director and chief development officer, told PTI over the weekend.The previous chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya too had initiated a slew of pro-employee measures such as letting them choose the location before transferring a couple of both of them are with the bank, extending sick leave to attend to in-laws health needs, long leaves to help their children during the exams among others.He said the bank has hired an external hand to design the programme, and started implementing it in December with the top management, including chairman Rajnish Kumar.Over 350 trained staff are reaching out to every employee in the programme, which is the first major initiative reaching out to every member of the staff in over four years. They undertake five to six hour-long sessions which end with a team dinner with each ones spouses, Kumar said.Half the staff has already undergone the module and the programme will be finished by March 15, in time to let the employees focus on the heavy duty workdays towards the end of the fiscal year, he said.At the end of the training module, the employee signs a pledge which draws from the banks value statement released last year, vowing to keep herself healthy, not damage the environment, speak positively of the bank and leave for home at least once a week.Interestingly, the pledge card has a special bar code which, if scanned by the employees spouse using a mobile phone, will send out an alert to the employees superiors about the employee spending long time at work and result in corrective action, Kumar said.Without mentioning non-performing assets, Kumar said the banking sector has had a difficult time in the last two-three years which has affected the employees and the bank found it essential to rejuvenate and prepare them for the future as well.While stressing that the worst is behind the bank, the employee is told about the business plan and also the way banking is changing due to technology, which will entail changes in their working as well, he said.The bank had already started stressing on the importance of employees health and the need to maintain work-life balance around a year ago, Kumar said, adding this programme takes it up as a strong need."

description,"Bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that marks a pause in the movement of a price halfway through a strong uptrend, giving an opportunity to go long and profit from the rest of the price rise."
content,"Chandan TapariaWe will be discussing about Pennants. Pennants are continuation chart patterns formed after strong moves. After a big upward or downward move, buyers or sellers usually pause to catch their breath before taking the pair further in the same direction. Because of this, the price usually consolidates and forms a tiny symmetrical triangle which is called a pennant. While the price is still consolidating, more buyers or sellers usually decide to jump in on the strong move, forcing the price to break out of the pennant formation.Bullish pennant is a continuation pattern that marks a pause in the movement of a price halfway through a strong uptrend, giving an opportunity to go long and profit from the rest of the price rise. In other words, Bullish pennants occur just after a sharp rise in price and resemble a triangular flag as the price moves sideways, making gradually lower highs and higher lows. The uptrend then continues with another similar-sized rise in price. The sharp climb in price would resume after a brief period of consolidation when bulls gather enough energy to take the price higher again.NoneA Bearish pennant is the exact opposite of a Bullish pennant. They are continuation patterns that mark a pause in the movement of a price halfway through a strong downtrend offering an opportunity to go short. This pattern is formed during a steep, almost vertical, downtrend. After that sharp drop in price, some sellers close their positions while other sellers decide to join the trend, making the price consolidate for a bit. As soon as enough sellers jump in, the price breaks below the bottom of the pennant and continues to move down.Unlike the other chart patterns where the size of the next move is approximately the height of the formation, pennant signals much stronger moves.NoneMotilal Oswal Financial Services Limited."

content,"Soumya MalaniMarkets continue to move on its own with a select few large-caps holding pushing the markets higher while the overall market is absolutely in a horror state.Small-cap index since January 2018 was down by nearly 40 percent. Going forward, either the large-caps should correct or the overall market should recover. We feel the chances of latter happening pretty soon in a steady matter.Distress selling, hopefully, is set to get over in the near-term. The only problem with the retail investors is that they enter markets at the peak and leave when it is actually the time of entry.There's silence everywhere including all those investing based on WhatsApp groups conversations and renowned web forums. Gone are the days when there used to be so much of discussion.It only means aversion to equities. It also means the bottom is not far. People who can endure this notional loss and stay put in a high conviction would be big winners once the next cycle starts.Forget all macro and let’s concentrate on something which matters to investors now:1) Track 3 things - Earnings, Earnings, EarningsWell, to start with. There’s no bull or bear market these days as the cycle has shortened. Previously, it would be 5 years of bull market and a bear market with the same proportion of time. But, at present, the phases have become much more frequent.Wherever there will be growth, the market would pay a premium. Long-run stocks go up only for three reasons. 1. Earnings 2. Earnings 3. Earnings- Peter Lynch.2) In a good market the PE gets re-ratedNothing actually changed over the last few months, but at the point of penning this note, the broader market is in a horrible state with a nomenclature of companies down about 30 percent to even 80 percent from their 2018 peaks.The good part is that a lot of quality companies with time would not only move back to their old highs but would make new life highs as well. The bad part is that over 80 percent of the companies wouldn’t hit their previous high for the next many years. The greed and fear syndrome in the market is back in vogue with this time being the latter.In a good market the PE gets re-rated and vice versa on the reverse. Soon the albatrosses would find their junks desolated venue to make northward ways for the quality one. Your patience will get tested but a conviction would be wildly rewarded.3) Hold on as the market would get re-ratedIf you are anxious about your portfolio but possess good quality companies with solid growth ahead backed by robust pedigree, soothe your nerves by fathoming the simple thing.The country is happy to grow by 6-7 percent yet the companies in your portfolio would grow at a minimum 20-25 percent. A few will grow by 40-50 percent CAGR for the next 3-5 years.That’s serious growth folks. It is only a matter of time before sanity comes back to the markets with eventual re-rating of good stocks irrespective of small, mid or large-caps.4) Understand of business is the keyWhen we go and speak to the management of a specific company or visit their plants in person, it is a completely different scenario. Everyone seems to be working overtime.The order books are full, there are more queries than ever. New employees are getting recruited, plants are being expanded which takes you to a different state of mind altogether.The ideology remains simple, try to have that feel of lucrative business ownership and stock markets would automatically be a different place for you.5) Growth stories, stocks will make you richerNoneNoneNext Multibagger ThemesForget about looking at the past but let’s also understand where will the future multibaggers come from. Which could be the next set of massive wealth creators?Well, future multibaggers are going to come from those companies who solve climate change, or precision medicine to cure cancer. Water purification and anything related to organic or anything where there is the scope of value-added products should do great too.The Indian aviation sector posted the fastest full-year domestic growth rate for the fourth consecutive year. Not sure about the airline stocks, but we feel that it is way better to play the proxies and that would make serious money for the investors. We are also high on the API and manufacturing theme.NoneIt fascinates us to the core after sensing so many of the gullible retailers who are happy locking their money in FDs for decades, generating absolute post-tax peanuts but refrains to give a bit of time to the best wealth generation asset in the world.(Arun Mukherjee and Soumya Malani, who hail from Kolkata, are partners in Equity Wealth, a SEBI-registered investment advisory firm.

He couldn't be named in line with policy.Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region at the heart of decades of hostility, is claimed in entirety by India and Pakistan, but ruled in part by both the south Asian countries.Indian officials say Umair is a nephew of the chief of the Jaish, Masood Azhar, who is believed to be in Pakistan.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a befitting reply to the attack and says he has given the military a free hand to tackle cross border militancy.The Jaish is considered one of the most lethal militant groups and has expanded its presence in Kashmir, the police officer said."

He, however, had added his party was ""eager"" for a tie-up with Congress in the national capital to avoid a three-cornered contest involving the BJP.The same day when Kejriwal said this, Sharmistha Mukherjee resigned as chief spokesperson of the Congress's Delhi unit, expressing her desire to contest the Lok Sabha election.""If given a ticket by the party I will contest the Lok Sabha election. I will apply for ticket,"" she said, without revealing her preferred choice of seat.But the Congress leader said she is a probable from Chandni Chowk constituency.Former Union minister Kapil Sibal, former deputy speaker of Delhi Assembly Shoaib Iqbal and Haroon Yusuf are other contenders from Chandni Chowk, he said.Congress insiders say either Kirti Azad or Shatrughan Sinha, both of who are looking for a new home after differences with top BJP leaders, may be fielded from North East Delhi constituency, currently held by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.They claimed Sinha is also in touch with the Congress ""high-command"" for his political shift.Chaudhary Mateen Ahmad is also a contender from the seat, which has a sizeable number of minorities, they said, adding that former Delhi minister JP Agarwal is another probable from there.""From South Delhi, former MP from the seat Ramesh Kumar may be considered but the party could look for others like Yoganand Shastri and Chatar Singh, as Kumar is the brother of anti-Sikh riot case convict Sajjan Kumar,"" the Congress leader said.A K Walia and Arvinder Singh Lovely, ministers in the Sheila Dikshit government, are vying for party ticket from East Delhi seat.

Processed minerals, inorganic chemicals, raw cotton including waste, cotton fabrics, and glass and glassware are also among such items that account for 95 per cent of the total shipments.""After drastically hiking the import duty on goods coming from Pakistan, we will isolate them in front of trade. Hiking of the duty at this level would completely hit exporters of Pakistan,"" Professor Biswajit Dhar of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said.Sharing similar views, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai said that Pakistan would face significant impact due to this decision.The two main items imported from Pakistan are fruits and cement, which attracted customs duty of 30-50 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively.Domestic importers who have already placed their orders from Pakistan may face issues after this decision.They may have to pay the 200 per cent duty or undertake lot of paperwork to get their consignments, an industry source said.Taking strong economic action against Pakistan following the Pulwama terror attack, India Saturday raised the customs duty to 200 per cent on all goods imported from the neighbouring country.India's imports from Pakistan had increased to USD 488.5 million in 2017-18 from USD 455.5 billion in 2016-17.Hike in the duty would drastically increase the prices of Pakistani goods in Indian markets which would make them far less competitive as compared to other imported goods.Slapping an import duty of 200 per cent effectively means almost banning the imports from Pakistan.Total India-Pakistan trade has increased marginally to USD 2.41 billion in 2017-18 as against USD 2.27 billion in 2016-17."

title,Explainer: Six factors that influence interest rates in an economy
datetime,2019-04-26 15:06:00+00:00
description,"Demand for and supply of money, government borrowing, inflation, Central Bank’s monetary policy objectives affect the interest rates. "
content,"Reserve Bank of India has cut the repo rate by 25 basis points in the maiden monetary policy review of the calendar year 2019. It indicates interest rates in the economy are on their way down. Besides the repo rate, following are a few factors that influence the interest rates in the economy. Here are they:NoneA very high inventory is detrimental, so they produce less. In effect, they borrow less, ergo less demand for money. Consumers also spend less as a bad economy could result in job loss. Other things remaining the same, higher the demand for money higher the interest rates.NoneThere are situations wherein the investors do not have attractive avenues and they chase the bonds or deposits. If there is no demand for that money at that moment, then the interest rates go down.In recessionary times the interest rates tend to go down. A case in point is the sudden dip that took place in bond yields for a short period of time after the announcement of demonetisation.As the general public deposited the demonetised currency notes into bank accounts, banks were flooded with money. The banks could not lend all that money so they choose to invest in government securities and that led to a fall in yields on bonds. Please note that fall in bond yields was temporary.NoneHigher the fiscal deficit, higher the government borrowing, higher the interest rates. Generally, bond markets respond to higher fiscal deficits by an uptick in bond yields.NoneSavers need to be compensated by way of higher interest rates for sacrificing their current consumption motives in a high inflationary scenario. Investors will forgo their current consumption and invest in fixed income investments if they get positive real rate of return.The real rate of return is arrived at by deducting inflation number from the nominal rate of return offered on the bonds and deposits. The ideas to keep the real rate of return positive so that after inflation the saver saves something. That means in high inflation era, the interest rates tend to stay up and vice versa.NoneIf India wants to attract global capital then the interest rates in India need to go up if the interest rates are going up globally. There are occasions such as the Lehman Crisis in 2008 when the central bankers across the globe choose to cut interest rates to pull the global economy out of recession.Attractive interest rates bring in capital and support the foreign exchange rate. Tweaks in the interest rates in the economy can be used by a central bank for influencing the exchange rate. A central bank may choose to up the policy rates (repo rate in India) to indicate higher interest rates in the economy and thereby attract capital from overseas investors."

content,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has suffered a series of political reverses in recent months but widespread anger after 40 troopers were killed in an Islamist militant attack last week could lead to a surge in support for his Hindu nationalist party.As emotions run high following the deadliest attack on security forces in decades, Modi, who faces a general election by May, said he had given a free hand to security forces to avenge the killings in Kashmir, the region disputed with arch-foe Pakistan.Tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have ratcheted up and shouts of ""down with Pakistan"" and ""blood for blood"" have reverberated at funerals of the victims. Many Indians have held candle-lit marches across the country demanding the government ""not forget, not forgive"".The attack has been claimed by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group but the Pakistan government has denied any responsibility.Rakesh Kumar, a 32-year-old part-time teacher in Kasba Bonli town in the western state of Rajasthan, said he was now inclined to vote for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the national election after backing the main opposition Congress in a state vote late last year.""If he teaches Pakistan a lesson, support for him will rise,"" Kumar said in a telephone interview. ""It's a matter of the country's security, and we need to see what he can do for us.""The BJP was ousted from power in three major states, including Rajasthan, in December, and Modi has been blamed for weak rural incomes and an inability to provide employment to the millions of young Indians entering the job market each year.Although still tipped to win, pollsters had said before the attack that the ruling party could fall short of a majority in the general election.No polls have been published since the attack, but political analysts say the anti-Pakistan wave has become a rallying point for the BJP.Yogendra Yadav, a former pollster and now a political activist, said the Kashmir attack would be a distraction from economic challenges facing the government.""Ever since those issues have emerged, there have been systematic attempts to divert attention, some by design, some by accident,"" he said.""The consequence (of the attack) would be to bring the spotlight on issues of national security, which is exactly what the ruling party may have wanted.""NO COMPROMISEThe BJP has not lost time in underlining its nationalist credentials. Addressing a political rally on Sunday, party president Amit Shah ended a brief period of bipartisan politics by saying that Modi was better at responding to militant attacks than the previous government headed by Congress.""This time it's not a Congress government that is in power. The BJP government of Narendra Modi does not do any compromise in matters of national security,"" Shah said to loud cheers.""The BJP government will completely uproot terrorism. Narendra Modi's political will to finish terrorism is the highest among global leaders.""Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state and an outspoken critic of Modi, has lashed out at the BJP comments.""We didn't raise any questions (about the attack) because we thought we will be united in the fight (against terror),"" she told reporters. ""But now we see that we are silent and they are giving such speeches that it seems only they are patriots and the rest are outsiders.""Modi has often spoken about adopting a more muscular approach to Pakistan, after a surprise visit to the neighbour in 2015 failed to improve ties.BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli declined to say if the response to the attack would be an election issue for the party. But he defended party chief Shah's comments as a reflection of the ""national mood of grief and anger"".In 2016, Indian forces carried out what they called a ""surgical strike"" on militant targets across the border in Pakistan in retaliation to an attack on an army camp in Kashmir.Earlier this month, before last week's attack, Modi said the strike had ""shown to the world what will be the new policy and culture in India"".On Monday, he said any hesitation to take action against militancy and those who support it was akin to encouraging the menace."

To the uninitiated, the M series was recently launched by Samsung to take on Chinese smartphone manufacturers such as Xiaomi, Honor and Realme which offer smartphones with best-in-class specs at highly competitive prices.The Galaxy M10 and M20 that went on sale in India earlier this month witnessed an unprecedented first-day sale record. The South Korean giant made a statement saying, “We are delighted by the unprecedented consumer response and thank people for their love and support.""Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy M30 will likely feature the same chip (Exynos 7904 SoC) and battery capacity (5000 mAh) as the M20. The phone will be available in two variants, including one with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage and another with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage.While the Super AMOLED panel gives the M30 a massive advantage in the display area, it may still be lacking in other areas. With the spec sheet already out for Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7, the Galaxy M30 is going to have a tough time keeping up."

description,The black snow was first spotted at a coal mining region around Kemerovo area in southwest Siberia.
content,"The presence of soot and coal dust in the air has reportedly resulted in black snowfall in Russia’s Siberia. The black snow was first spotted at a coal mining region around Kemerovo area in southwest Siberia.NoneWhile the black snow made for an eerily beautiful spectacle of a winter wonderland, it served as an ugly reminder of how the coal mining industry can harm the environment and pose serious health hazards.It also indicates that very little regulation exists in the coal mining industry, something that the green crusaders have been trying to highlight for long.NoneHe added: “There is a lot of coal dust in the air all the time. When snow falls, it just becomes visible. You can’t see it the rest of the year, but it is still there.”Notably, there are several open coal pits in Kuznetsk Basin, the central point of Russia’s coal industry; activists say the pollutants emitted by them are impacting the health and wellbeing of the locals.The life expectancy of the residents of the area is at least three-four years lesser than the national average. Additionally, the incidence of cancer, TB meningitis, and child cerebral palsy is also high among the 2.6 million inhabitants of the area.Andrei Panov, Deputy Governor, Kuznetsk Basin, said the black snow may have originated from coal-burning factories, vehicles, or other unspecified businesses.Interestingly, in December last year, Kemorovo officials were accused of painting the snow white to conceal the presence of soot and ash in it.A video shared by Moscow Times showed a woman’s hands getting coated in white paint after she touched snow collected outside Mysky’s municipal recreation centre."

title,"Life of an Indian pilot: Extra hours, high EMIs and a fat salary that's often delayed"
datetime,2019-02-19 12:47:00+00:00
description,"Despite a huge demand for them, pilots in India are in a sorry state. And that is not good news."
content,"The day hadn't ended well for Ayesha*, a pilot at one of India's low-cost airlines. Her final flight of the day was delayed by three hours, and embarrassed, she hadn't even waited to say bye to passengers, something that the 26-year-old liked to do. Ayesha was waiting at the tarmac when she was told that her taxi was not coming, and she would have to take the bus along with passengers to the terminal.Avoiding eye contacts with fliers - lest someone asked her about the delay  - Ayesha waited impatiently for the bus to reach the terminal. The flight had landed past midnight, and it was now nearly 1 am. Ayesha just wanted to get back home and crash.Then her phone rang.""Report for the 6 am flight,"" said the manager who handled pilot rostering. Ayesha refused flat out.But he insisted, saying that there was a shortage of pilots. ""Please don't make me fly,"" Ayesha was now pleading. ""I have been flying for six days, and it's my off tomorrow. I need to sort things at home,"" the pilot was almost begging now, unaware of all the eyes in the bus were on her.The manager was unrelenting.  Ayesha pleaded, again and again. But it's of no use. She hung up. And as she stepped out of the bus, she heard the dreaded notification on her phone. She was on the 6am flight.This was not the dream job that the junior flight officer had signed up for three years ago.Miles away, Pratik,* a captain with a major Indian airline, was having problem managing his finances. Yes, he was paid well. Very well, in fact. Captains take home about Rs 8 lakh a month. But it is of little use if the salary is delayed, or is not paid in full.It had been months since he got a full salary at a time, and that was showing in his bank balance. ""I'm now forced to dip into my savings, to pay the EMI on my home loan,"" he says. He and his family live in Mumbai's Powai, in a posh colony where flats sell for Rs 5 crore upwards. He declined to say how much the EMI was, but says it runs into lakhs.Isolated events? No. Ironical? Yes.A typical pilot in India starts her or his career, sometimes by the age of 21, with a salary of over Rs 1 lakh a month. A captain takes home as much as Rs 10 lakh monthly. There is seemingly no dearth of jobs, thanks to the domestic aviation industry that is among the fastest growing in the world. The country needs 17,000 pilots over the next decade, says consultancy firm CAPA.NoneBut here is the catch. Pilots in two full-service carriers  - Air India and Jet Airways - have gone months without being paid. Many haven't got their allowances for six months. And in most of the low-cost airlines, pilots are a tired lot, flying incessantly and many of them fill up their annual limits within 10 months.Pilots in Jet and Air India have threatened to go on protests if their dues are not met immediately. And at IndiGo, the 'mismatch' between pilots' availability and requirement came to fore after February 7, when hailstorms initially led to diversion of flights, and later cancellations of scores of flights. Facing a pilot shortage, the airline finally announced that it has curtailed its schedule by 30 flights a day, till the end of March.NoneBut how did the mismatch happen?""The airlines haven't erred in their ambition to grow. The economic development in the country, and the big programs like Make in India and Smart City, can't happen without air connectivity,"" says Rituparna Chakraborty, Executive Vice President, TeamLease Services, a leading recruitment company.""Logically thinking, while giving out big aircraft orders and clearing business plans, they should figure out their manpower needs,"" she adds.But looks like the airlines hadn't. They erred.Optimising resources NoneConstrained by trying industry circumstances like high crude rates, fluctuating currency and intense competition that has kept fares low, airlines are desperate for ways to cut costs. It doesn't help that most of them are in a delicate condition.NoneNoneTo cut costs, some airlines delayed salaries. Others tried to maximise resources through a tool called crew optimiser.""Two airlines in India use this software, for crew rostering. It’s good for the company - better crew utilisation and lower overall costs,"" said a senior executive from the industry, who didn't want to be identified. In other words, companies could cut down on recruitment too.At the same time, crew optimiser ""has resulted in a lot of ad hoc flying,  leading to a lot of upset pilots.  It takes a toll on the crew flying pattern,"" he added.Airlines who don't use the software tried different ideas. One low-cost airline planned to do away with a permanent base for its pilots.A permanent base is important because it allows a pilot to get adequate rest, and maintain a degree of work-life balance. For example, if Delhi is the permanent base, then the pilot will be given rest every few days with his family and will be made to fly from there.But the airline, to save costs, wanted to make its co-pilots fly from any base and rest him in any city -  and not the home base - as per its convenience. This would have endangered the pilot's work-life balance.The plan was later taken back after Yeshwant Shenoy, a lawyer and aviation safety activist threatened legal action against the airline and the DGCA, the industry regulator.Fighting fatigueWorld over, crew scheduling is done according to the flight duty time limitation (FDTL) guidelines set down by the respective regulatory authority,  which in India is the DGCA.""The FDTL lays down the daily, monthly, quarterly and yearly limits of flying time. It is set down to prevent fatigue in pilots,"" says Shakti Lumba, aviation professional and former Executive Director Airline Operations (Alliance Air) and Vice President Ops (IndiGo).”But in order to maximise resources and cut down on costs airlines tend to fly pilots to regulatory limits""For a healthy work-life balance, flying 70 hours a month is the ideal. Today this number has increased to about 80-100 hours on an average across most airlines,"" said the industry executive quoted earlier in the story.While the airlines benefit as their requirement for additional pilots reduces, most of the pilots fall in line as any flying beyond the limit gets them over-time allowance. ""This brings in the greed factor,"" says the executive.But greed can't keep fatigue at bay.Lumba explains: ""There is transit fatigue, which takes place when you do a duty. To reduce it,the pilot is given prescribed rest after every flight duty period and additional 24 hrs every seven days. All fatigue cannot get eliminated and accumulates.""Consider a pilot's typical day.If she or he lives in one of the metros, getting to the airport could take up to two hours and the duty hours start only once the pilot reports. In many of the developed nations, the transportation time is also taken into account. But not in India.The pilot flies to three to five sectors a day, totaling about eight hours of flying time on an average, and a flight duty time of about 11-12 hours a day. Add to this, staying in hotels and dealing with weather (especially in the monsoon/fog season); these factors lead to mental and physical fatigue.""When you are young, this is fine. As time passes and repetition sets in, this causes chronic mental and physical fatigue, which any pilot starts to feel it after about seven to eight years of flying,"" says a senior pilot who declined to be identified.While Lumba recalls days when pilots would get two weeks ‘off’ after every 11 weeks ‘on’. This countered cumulative fatigue and ensure no pilot exceeded the 1000 hrs in 12 month limit. ""But now on an average they only get 22 days off in 12 months to increase pilot productivity and has resulted in  cumulative fatigue built up and pilots timing out in 10 months,"" he says.Lifestyle trapLearning to fly is an expensive affair, and can cost up to Rs 1 crore.Many of the pilots take huge loans, and thus need the job, despite all its pressures. ""Most of the pilots are effectively high school pass. They don't have any other skill apart from flying,"" says Shenoy.Shenoy recalls the days immediately after Kingfisher Airlines collapsed and many pilots were forced to take up jobs in call centres.Job security is important. And expenses keep piling. While earlier airlines would train new recruits for free, now the fresh entrants are sometimes asked to pay as much as Rs 30 lakh to get trained on job.There are bonds too, sometimes as high as Rs 1 crore, stipulating that the pilot serve anywhere between five to 10 years. If a pilot wants to quit even a day earlier, he or she has to pay Rs 1 crore.And then there is what the experts call, ""the lifestyle trap.""""Many of the pilots start earning up to Rs 5 lakh a month by the time they turn 30. They get used to a certain lifestyle - expensive cars, big homes,"" says Shenoy.In all, pilots are not just in a position to dictate terms when  - like in the case of Ayesha - they are asked to take up extra work.The effects can be seen in several ways. Shenoy points at the increasing number of pilots who have been declared temporary medically unfit, and permanently medically unit (TMU and PMU in industry jargon). ""You also hear a rising number of divorces among pilots,"" adds Shenoy.Shortage of captainsThe industry norm is to have seven captains and seven co-pilots for each aircraft. ""As it is not possible for all the pilots to be available all the time, the practice was to recruit more to ensure a bench strength of ‘available to fly’ pilots due an average availability of only 260/270 days out of 365 days” says Lumba.But not anymore.The industry is especially feeling the pinch when it comes to availability of captains.IndiGo's Prock-Schauer said that the airline's pilot-to-aircraft ratio is 6.65, which will improve in the coming months as the carrier trains more of its co-pilots, or senior first officers, to become captains.The up gradation, say industry experts, is not easy.  While the limit for minimum hours of flying has been lowered to get the promotion, the transition involves several rounds of training. ""It can take at least three months, and as many as six months for a co-pilot to become a captain,"" says an industry executive.IndiGo hopes to plug the gap by recruiting expat pilots. It already has 40 of them, and plans to recruit at least 100 more in the coming months. But then, getting an expat pilot is a long drawn process that can take up to five months as it involves getting a security clearance from the DGCA.""And all these months, you will have to pay him too. Many also insist that they need to go back to their home country once in three months,"" said an industry executive.That is not good news for an industry that is looking to cut costs, and improve its margins.Collective effortWith shortage of such a critical resource becoming a major concern, industry experts hope that industry regulator takes note.For instance, ""DGCA licensing is very time consuming and flight training in India takes about 1.5-2 years whereas one can complete the entire training in the US in six months,"" says an industry executive.But till then, the pilots are forced to get used to the extra hours in the air."

content,"NoneFormerly known as Financial Technologies Ltd (FTIL), 63 Moons and some of its former executives, including founder Jignesh Shah, are under the scanner of multiple probe agencies regarding the Rs 5,600 crore payment scam at the now defunct National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).Against this backdrop, 63 Moons chairman Venkat Chary said legal notices have been served to Chidambaram, former Additional Secretary at the Finance Ministry K P Krishnan and former Forward Markets Commission (FMC) Chairman Ramesh Abhishek for allegedly destroying the ecosystem and causing huge damage to the company's shareholders.Chidambaram was finance minister when the NSEL crisis came to light in late 2013. While FMC has since been merged with markets regulator Sebi, Abhishek is presently Secretary of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).Krishnan is currently the Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Secretary. Speaking to reporters here, Chary said the company has also filed a criminal complaint with the CBI against the three individuals for allegedly taking ""malafide actions against 63 Moons by abusing their powers"".Chary claimed that the three individuals allegedly played a proactive role in ""perpetrating the crisis, destroying the exchange ecosystem created by the FTIL in order to favour competitor National Stock Exchange (NSE) resulting in huge damages to the shareholders of 63 Moons Technologies...""""As a result, the company has decided to file legal suits, seeking damages worth Rs 10,000 crore, against former Finance Minister P Chidambaram and others. Today, we have served the notice to them,"" he said, adding that suits will be filed in the Bombay High Court.Chary alleged that Chidambaram had approved a note of Krishnan forcing other co-promoters of commodity bourse NCDEX to sell their stake to the NSE clearly revealing their mala fide interference in the competition within the exchange industry.Further, he alleged that Abhishek was ""aware of the role of brokers and traders but acted in a partisan manner only against NSEL and its parent company."" Jignesh Shah, founder of erstwhile FTIL, alleged that it was not a crisis but a conspiracy to destroy the FTIL Group.Of the Rs 5,600 crore payment, Rs 600 crore has been paid so far to genuine investors. About Rs 3,600 crore decree has to be executed, while Rs 1,000 crore in the pipeline, Shah added.Further, Shah claimed that the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) report on the NSEL scam had put the spotlight on the defaulting brokers, traders and the executive management of the spot exchange. He also hoped that Sebi would take action against the defaulting entities."

content,"A lost and forgotten model of Maruti 800 is undergoing restoration at an authorised Maruti service centre, after almost a decade of being ignored and left to rot.This is no ordinary model as it is the first Maruti 800 to be ever sold in India. Bearing the registration number ‘DIA 6479’, the white Maruti 800 was owned by Delhi-based Harpal Singh who won it in a lucky draw and was handed the keys by India’s then PM, Indira Gandhi.Since December 14, 1983, Harpal Singh had been living happily with his car until his demise in 2010, after which the car was left in a neglected state.The car was first noticed in 2015 and after many offers to purchase it and restore it, the car finally got its due. Though it is not clear who has taken the initiative, RTO records state that it is still registered in Harpal Singh’s name.The Maruti 800 was an extremely successful car, that managed to hold its own against the likes of Fiat Premier Padmini and HM Ambassador, both of which were well-established cars back then.The Maruti 800 was powered by a 796cc, three-cylinder F8D petrol engine which made a measly 35 BHP of peak power. However, the extremely sturdy and reliable quality of the engine meant that it was a long-haulier and is still used in cars produced today, albeit with mechanical improvements."

datetime,2019-02-19 14:50:00+00:00
description,The tax refunds following favourable court orders would eventually pave the way for the custodian to release the assets of the Mehtas
content,"NoneThe scam had shook the country and changed the rules of the game on Dalal Street.The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has scrapped over Rs 2,000 crore of tax additions made by the Income Tax Department on members of the Mehta family -- late Harshad Mehta, his wife Jyoti, and brother Ashwin -- for assessment year 1992-93.ITAT's decision was based on an analysis of various transactions relating to trades in money and stock markets for the said period. The tribunal also looked into the facts in questioning the assessment order of February 1995 when the I-T Department pegged the untaxed income of the Mehtas at over Rs 2,014 crore.""The tribunal has reiterated the cardinal principle of taxation that in spite of the probes and observations by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and seizure of volumes of documents, the I-T department has to compute the correct taxable income embedded in the transactions. Every receipt by an assessee cannot be termed as taxable income. The tribunal has done a commendable job of analysing each transaction and commuting taxable income. The volume and value were no deterrent in deciding this pending litigation by the last fact-finding authority,"" a senior chartered accountant Dilip Lakhani told the paper.NoneWhat is the Harshad Mehta scam?Harshad Mehta, a registered broker, and his partners were accused of manipulating the Bombay Stock Exchange in 1992 by taking advantage of loopholes in the banking system. Mehta used the ready forward (RF) deal to insert money into the market. RF deals were short-term loans from one bank to another. The deals were generally made with the help of brokers, who were paid commissions.Mehta allegedly colluded with bank employees to get fake bank receipts (BRs) issued. He used these BRs to get other banks to lend him money under the false impression that they were lending against government securities (G-Secs). This amount was then put into the stock market to enhance share prices up to a staggering 4400 percent. Harshad Mehta then sold these shares at a significant profit and the principal amount was then returned to the banks.In this manner, Mehta defrauded banks of nearly Rs 4,000 crore. Once his mode of operation in the stock market was discovered and exposed, banks realised that they were in possession of fake BRs holding no value.NoneThe case caused a furore in the Parliament, leading to his arrest and sweeping changes in the stock market and tighter norms. He was convicted by both the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court and charged with 74 criminal offences, which dragged on until 2001 when he passed away at the age of 47.What happened next?After the scam came into the light, the tax department conducted a raid on the Mehtas on February 28, 1992, when several documents and share certificates were seized. On June 4, 1992, CBI carried out a search operation on the Mehtas, and subsequently, the tax return filed by Harshad Mehta for the assessment year 1992-93 was rejected by the department.According to the report, the assessment order by the department issued in February 1995 was built on fresh additions and disallowances such as ‘money market oversold position’ (Rs 1,080.58 crore), ‘money market unexplained stock’ (Rs 291.05 crore), ‘profit on sale of shares in shortage’ (Rs 253.16 crore), ‘unexplained money’ (Rs 251.8 crore), ‘interest on securities in money market’ (Rs 58.27 crore), ‘money market difference received’ (Rs 35.55 crore), ‘share market trading profit’ (Rs 16 crore).What’s in store next?The I-T Department may have little ground to move the Bombay High Court to challenge the order as ITAT’s verdict is based on facts and on the principle of tax law, as per the report.Refund amounts from the tax department would go to the custodian that was created under a special law for impounding assets of the scam accused. This would eventually pave the way for the custodian to release the assets of the Mehtas."

description,Companies are no longer looking for talent only in professional colleges and universities. They are hunting for talented foreign language students and willing to pay them competitively as well.
content,"“Walk-in for Amazon” for the job title ‘Digital Content Associate,’ read a recruitment poster just outside Hayakawa Japanese Language school in Chennai. You could see similar posters in Max Mueller Bhavan (German Language Institute), including the one in Delhi, and probably across other foreign language institutions.Companies, it turns out, are now looking for talent that is not in just professional colleges and universities. They are hunting for talent and are willing to pay competitively for foreign language students as well.NoneThe pay package the company was willing to offer ranged between Rs 5 lakh and above per annum for the former, and up to Rs 2.6 - 3.6 lakh for the latter. The jobs are based in Chennai.Yuko Shimizu, who runs the Japanese language school said, “First time they (Amazon) recruited, 3-4 months back, they were looking for freshers’ with basic Japanese language skill to do spell-checking for Japanese products and such. Around six people were selected out of the 40 who appeared.""In the second drive, Amazon was looking for a more sophisticated skill set. Now the e-retail giant wanted candidates who could speak, read and write Japanese. So apart from just proofreading, these candidates will also edit Japanese content such as book reviews on Amazon Kindle.Gayathri Raghavan, 45 and a homemaker, was one of the two selected among the 10 who came for the job interview.An excited Raghavan, who is getting back to the workforce after a gap of seven years, said, “I could not believe that I was doing so well in the interview. I took the Japanese language as a hobby when I was 42 and did not expect the chance to work for a company like Amazon.” Raghavan is a mother of two and was a school teacher seven years back.Though Raghavan is not clear about her job profile, she explained that she will be editing Japanese content for the Amazon Kindle.You could find similar stories for other foreign languages such as German and French going by the recruitments ads posted by the company on various platforms such as Linkedin, its own website and on other job search platforms.A few years back the only job opportunities available for foreign language professionals like Raghavan were translation and interpretation. However, things are changing as localisation gains prominence with technology companies willing to invest to acquire more customers.This means there are more options now for foreign language students and hence, more students enrol in foreign language courses now.According to a 2016 report, the demand for foreign languages has accelerated due to adoption of technology-based products. This has resulted in three million foreign exchange students and is expected to add another 2.6 million, the report stated.The data might not be too much of a stretch. Amazon has been on a localising spree for its products such as voice-assistant Alexa and deploying customised language site in each region. Apart from bigger companies entering the fray, we have also recently seen mushrooming of start-ups in the linguistic space such as Uniphore and Reverie.Experts say at a time when job markets are down, burgeoning language industry opens up new opportunities for freshers and experienced people."

title,Agartala on its way to becoming a major hub for trade and commerce
datetime,2019-02-19 13:18:00+00:00
description,The government of India – in conjunction with the state government of Tripura - is working hard to complete the bridge over River Feni near Sabroom. 
content,"RN BhaskarFour years ago, Agartala was a sleepy town despite being the capital of Tripura. It does figure in the news sometimes but four years ago, it was too big to be called a village and too small to be called a city. It was at best a town, but an underdeveloped one at that.NoneBut now, you see many cars on the roads; traffic jams are not uncommon. The airport is being upgraded to touch Bangladesh's border (it is quite possible that an immigration gate could get opened here too in addition to the existing one). A few malls have begun to make their presence felt in the town. But it has yet to catch up with most state capitals in the country. Hotels are still a bit primitive – there is not a single five- (or even four) star hotel in the city.But the roads are good. And the first signs of this city becoming a major tourist destination are visible. Its sanctuaries are being spruced up, with some of the best facilities any tourist centre could boast of. Its lake palace – akin to Jaipur’s famous lake palace – looks gorgeous.But more important than these signs are the measures that are being taken – not yet reported in mainstream media – that could make Agartala the trade hub for almost all of North East India, and possibly for this entire Asian region as well.To understand why the change is taking place, it is important to look at two maps. The first map shows how – for the past 70 years -- access to the North East always depended on what is commonly referred to as the Chicken's Neck. The Doklam crisis highlighted India's vulnerability like never before.Fortunately, even earlier, some measures had been embarked upon. In 1999, both India and Bangladesh agreed to start a bus service between Kolkata and Dhaka. This was further extended to another route between Dhaka and Agartala in 2001. By 2008, this connectivity was further bolstered by reviving an old rail link between Kolkata and Dhaka. The present government is in the process of extending this rail link by connecting Dhaka and Agartala.Plans include a highway from Kolkata to Agartala, which would allow transportation between the two cities. Exit points for Dhaka will support immigration and customs controls. Already, the road, rail and the proposed highway have reduced the existing road link between Kolkata and Agartala from around 1579 km to just 434 km – but subject to immigration and customs checks.NoneBut something bigger is now happening. The government of India – in conjunction with the state government of Tripura - is working hard to complete the bridge over River Feni near Sabroom.  A bit of road extension from there will allow traffic from Agartala to reach Chittagong reducing the current route of around 300 km  to just around 200 km.It is this route that is likely to convert Agartala into a major trading centre for not only the North East, but also this Asian region.Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb hopes that the Feni bridge will get completed before December 2019. Goods will now flow from Chittagong to the entire North East.Defence sources are also ecstatic.  Without willing to go on record, a senior officer of the defence sources confessed that his route will become more important for army and related supply movements from India to the North East through Chittagong and Agartala.River routes are also being developed.  A jetty is being built at Sonambra, That will allow small ships (each capable of carrying load equivalent to that of 50 trucks) to travel up the Mahanadi River into the (North Eastern) Gomti River.  One of the biggest beneficiaries will be Mizoram, next door neighbour, which is also landlocked.  Over the next few years, river routes are likely to gain popularity over the road and rail routes because of two reasons.First, the entire North East is full of rivers. Each river touches villages and towns that are important consumption centres. Hence river transport will reach out to more people than rail or road will.  Second, river transport will invariably be cheaper than road or rail transport.  Expect this to develop further in the coming days.These linkages will soon transform Agartala into one of the biggest commercial hubs in this part of the world. Reason: almost everything that comes into Tripura for daily consumption is imported from other parts in the region. Take rice (the non sticky, usually Basmati variety) is brought into the state from Siliguri, and so are vegetables.  And milk. Plans are afoot – thanks to the work done by Central government ICAR (Indian Council for Agricultural Research) in partnership with the state government to get farmers to grow such crops and develop animal husbandry, including fishing.  Thus, the costs associated with the long, winding route from Siliguri should disappear.  And as the state gears up to export rice, vegetables and milk, the road ad water linkages with Chittagong will entirely change trade logistics.Secondly, the chief minister is already making moves to wean away the 85,000 Bangladesho trek into India each year to seek out medical treatment.  They travel from Agartala – using the checkpost in this city as a major crossover point, and travel to Kolkata or to other parts of India.  The state has already begun negotiations with mahor hospital chains in India to take over the lagest state owned hospital and convert it into a super-speciality medical centre – without giving up its function as a primary health care center.  The state hopes to be a big-time player in the medical tourism business soon.Many more moves are on the cards, which shall be discussed later. For now, the unlocking of routes for this land-locked state – surrounded by Bangladesh on three sides – will rapidly convert Agartala into one of the biggest business centres in the region.The markets will be watching developments very closely."

content,"NoneRefraining from revealing the current revenue numbers, Gilani said,  ""There are a lot of exciting new products as well as business strategies being implemented this year. Hence we are certain that our growth rates will only get better each year on.""Gilani started his career as a sales intern who walked the streets with the company’s salesmen before taking a seat at the company’s head office.The first project he took on when he joined the company in 2007 was to launch a completely new product line for the Indian market. For nearly four decades the company operated in just the Ready-to-Cook (RTC) category, he spearheaded Gits into the Ready-to-Eat (RTE) category.Currently, the RTE  and RTC market in India is worth Rs 1,000 – 1,200 crore growing at 10-15 percent year-on-year.  Pioneer in the RTC-RTE space in the country, Gits Food enjoys a market share of 25 percent in these segments currently.The well-established players in the RTC market are MTR Foods, Gits, Kohinoor, McCain Foods (India), Nestle (Maggi), and ITC India. Gilani believes they are barely scratching the surface yet with rapid urbanisation, busier lifestyles, and diminishing culinary skills, however, the demand for convenience foods have a bright future.""The industry needs to come together and increase consumer awareness about the category, and break the myths associated to catapult this growth,"" he said.Gits Food has a pan-India presence with over 1,000 distributors across the country with a diverse product portfolio, divided into categories such as instant mixes (breakfast, snacks and dessert mixes), ready meals, dairy. All these are available for sale in India as well as abroad. However, the west is their strongest market.""Our consumers are not just Indians and NRIs but also foreigners. Since we export to over 40 countries, we are selling our ready meals such as dal makhani, biryani and pav bhaji in international chain stores like Walmart, Costcos, Woolworths, and some more,"" Gilani said.When asked about the revenues from both online and offline retail Gilani said, ""Online retail is still a new concept. Three years back, we started our own e-store, while we are also available on Flipkart, Amazon and Big Basket.""Amazon and Big Basket are the two major online drivers for the company and the revenue from online is less than 5 percent at present. He expects online sales to touch double-digit in the coming years.NoneFurther, he said that with the growing trend of the organic and vegan products, Gits Food launched an organic and vegan version of ready meals abroad.Given the increasing demand for super-healthy products, Gilani said that ragi, oats and brown rice range were well received by the consumers.""These are niche products are not launched with a motive to gain very high volumes as they primarily sell in A-class outlets, modern trade, and e-commerce. It helps us cater to new-age customers and introduce them to the brand and category,"" he said.NoneFresh products such as milk, curd, and buttermilk are sold regionally in the west mainly in Mumbai and Pune markets. For the fresh category, the company plans to remain regional and expand deeper in the west.""There is no plan to go national with fresh dairy products due to their low shelf life. For products such as ghee and dairy whitener we have launched bulk 10 and 15 kg packs to boost volumes in institutional sales, this has enabled us to grow better over the past year with these products,"" he said.NoneAccording to Gilani, over the coming years, the lines between the RTC and RTE category will become more blur in their offerings.He said, ""We will focus on the millennials who are looking more convenient options. Hence our new launches will be focused on requiring a lot less time and effort. Albeit, keeping the quality, taste, and safety intact. We continue to stand for natural products.""NoneTV continues to dominate the company's budget as they advertise on TV channels in India as well as abroad.  However, in recent times one of the key strategies for the company is enhancing its digital presence."

title,Understanding ‘This Formula’ will accelerate your Financial Independence
datetime,2019-02-19 12:07:00+00:00
description,Being financial independent (or financially free) means different things to different people. But the idea is not just about having ‘enough money’.
content,"Dev AshishNoneMaybe its because they hate their jobs or maybe they want more flexibility in lives or maybe they just want to do something else that they really want to. Financial Independence indeed offers the exit option that many people have been waiting for years.And the fact that you are still reading this article is proof that you too feel that being Financially Independent can do a lot of good in your personal life. Isn't it?Being financial independent (or financially free) means different things to different people. But the idea is not just about having ‘enough money’.It’s more about how having enough money can give people the ownership of their lives and time back again. And that feeling or thought itself is liberating.You may now ask.How much money is enough to become Financially Independent?There is no perfect formulae becoming financially independent. Everyone will have a different number.But still, there is a thumb rule good enough to start with:NoneNoneIt actually depends on a wide range of factors like age, targeted age of financial independence, life expectancy, inflation, expected returns, handling sequence of returns risk, etc.NoneAs your savings begin to grow and years pass, you will have a better idea about future expenses and you can then have a more accurate financial independence calculation done for you.So now you know you need 30X to become Financially Independent. Now comes the interesting part…How to accelerate your Financial Freedom?Here is an example for better understanding.Suppose Deepak’s annual income is Rs 15 lakh. And his expenses for the year (let’s call it X) are Rs 12 lakh.Remember the so-called thumb rule for financial independence?NoneUsing the above logic, Deepak would need 30 times Rs 12 lakh - which is Rs 3.6 crore to become Financially Independent. But aren’t we missing something?NoneNoneThe annual income is the same as earlier Rs 15 lakh. But Deepak cuts down unnecessary spendings and reduces annual expenses (X) to Rs 9 lakh (from Rs 12 lakh earlier).Let’s use the 30X thumb rule again.Deepak now needs 30 times Rs 9 lakh - which is Rs 2.7 crore. Do note that this figure is less than the earlier calculated Rs 3.6 crore. So the first thing that happens is that the target is reduced to Rs 2.7 crore.Now comes the magical part.NoneSo essentially, what has happened is that Deepak’s target has been reduced from Rs 3.6 crore to Rs 2.7 crore. And he can also save a much higher Rs 6 lakh (instead of Rs 3 lakh).This is a double positive benefit of having a reduced target and higher savings capability!Using the thumb rule of 30X, here is what happens - If the expenses (X) are lowered, a smaller corpus would be needed to become financially independent. And a smaller corpus requires a lesser number of years to achieve it. More importantly due to lower expenses, the surplus for savings is more. Hence more money can be saved. Hence the double acceleration!If you have read till here, it is safe to say that you are interested in financial independence. But if you still aren’t convinced and feel that you will work till 60, then you need to wake up.You can never be sure when you might be made redundant in profession due to inability to keep up, the collapse of the industry you are working in, your deteriorating health or maybe due to some other random and unknown risk.Hence, you would be better off with some large savings base if you aim for some level of financial freedom. It’s like being prepared and having a Plan-B for the possibility of forced early retirement."

description,"Manipal, led by Ranjan Pai, was in race to buy Fortis Healthcare last year, but Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare outbid their rivals to buy the troubled healthcare provider."
content,"Manipal Hospitals, backed by US private equity investor TPG Capital had entered into negotiations with heart surgeon Naresh Trehan and other investors in October 2018 to acquire their stake in Medanta. Even after four months, it seems like the deal could take more time to close.A top executive from the Manipal-TPG camp told Moneycontrol that there is ""still some time before the deal could close"".The executive didn't specify how much time it would take for the deal to come through. Manipal, led by Ranjan Pai was in race to buy Fortis Healthcare, but Malaysia's IHH Healthcare outbid rivals to buy the troubled healthcare provider.Pai is believed to be aggressively pursuing Medanta as the deal would help Manipal expand its footprint in north India. The CEO and MD is reportedly seeking support from the world's largest private equity fund Blackstone to conclude the deal.On February 18, Economic Times reported that Blackstone will be joining Manipal and TPG, to invest about Rs 3,200 crore in a deal that is likely to cost Rs 6,000 crore, making it the second-largest transaction after Fortis Healthcare's sale to IHH.According to RoC filings, Medanta's holding company GHPL was valued at Rs 4,330.8 crore as of April 2018.Dr Trehan, his family members and co-founder Sunil Sachdevan own 55 percent, while the rest is held by Carlyle Group (27 percent) and Temasek (18 percent).Medanta runs a flagship super-specialty tertiary-care hospital in Gurugram called Medicity. It commenced operations in November 2009 and has a 1544 bed capacity as on March 31, 2018.Along with Medicity, Medanta operates a 120-bed hospital in Indore and a 174-bed hospital in Ranchi on lease. Medanta is in the process of doubling its bed count in the next two-three years by setting up hospitals in Lucknow, Patna and Noida.Why Medanta is up for sale?Medanta is not a loss making company, but its profits have been dwindling on account of macro and internal factors. While Medanta's revenues grew just 4 percent to Rs 1,392 crore in FY18 YoY, its net profit dropped 35 percent to Rs 33 crore during the period.The debt fueled expansion is eating into company's profits as finance costs go up and new hospitals take time to settle down and mature.According to an executive of a large trust-based hospital who didn't wish to be named, Medanta aggressively hired some top specialists from rival hospitals, by offering hefty salaries.""That hurt their bottom lines, some of them have eventually left, including a highly renowned cardiologist,"" the executive added.Rating agency Crisil pointed out that the hospital over relied on a single hospital and cardiac segment to drive business.""Revenue is marked by significant concentration risks in terms of geography and therapeutic segment. Post the increase in beds to 1,250, Medanta is the largest single-location hospital in the private sector in India,"" Crisil pointed out.Dr Trehan, 72, appointed his son-in-law Pankaj Sahni as CEO in September 2017. At the macro level, apart from temporary disruptions such as demonetisation and GST, competition, price controls, spiraling cost of hiring specialist doctors, expensive medical technologies and real estate costs, trust deficit between providers and patients, are posing operational nightmares for private healthcare providers.Private hospitals hope of getting volumes through the government's health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat didn't turn out as anticipated due to low package rates.Further, alleged medical negligence cases that made headlines sometime back sparked outrage forcing state governments to react has unnerved hospitals.Medanta too figured in one such case, but it was able to settle the case arresting the snowball."

We are now providing a sub-brand called Kaya Youth specifically targeted towards the entry mid-price points, so sub-Rs 400 price points. Marico is bringing a range of skincare products. So, we are providing them with the brand name under license, which means there’s a royalty arrangement between them and us.”He added that as Marico is trying to build a skincare portfolio, it needs credible brands because of the highly competitive nature of the market.“This is a great opportunity for them to use the brand Kaya,” he said.For Marico, by launching Kaya's new sub-brand, the company will try and reduce its dependence on hair oil and edible oil. The strategy is also to shift focus to a premium portfolio.As for Kaya’s new range, Nair said that the products will be mass distributed in comparison to what Kaya is doing. “This way, more FMCG, more mass markets, more premium outlets will have the Kaya products,” he said.Kaya has a presence in 26 cities and it retails its product line through 400 points of sales and through e-commerce.The company, which recently announced its third quarter results for FY19, reported an 11 percent revenue growth. Throwing more light on the Q3 results, Nair said that the company’s haircare grew by 54 percent.“We grew product retail business by about 20 percent. These were the larger two segments of growth. The growth of products was driven by a combination of e-commerce and increase and expansion in distribution. The growth in e-commerce is over 60 percent in the quarter.”More than 50 percent of Kaya Clinics products retail comes from channel outside the clinic.On whether the re-branding exercise will help improve business, Nair said that it will aid business but product category will be the company’s main focus.“Our product line in terms of range is expanding. There are few launches planned in the coming year. Our entire haircare portfolio was launched in the last six months. We also launched a range called Derma Naturals which is a combination of lip care and facial care. We are also coming up with a range of Derma Naturals for hair as an exclusive segment. The addition of haircare is also a brand growth for us,"" Nair added.Kaya’s product range, which currently contributes 20 percent to its overall revenue, is expected to grow by 25 percent this year.Kaya has worked on renovations for 24 of its clinics, making investments in technology –basically dermatology equipment – last year. The equipment that are imported and are USFDA approved cost around Rs 20-25 lakh.For the fourth quarter of FY19, Nair said that the company’s key focus will be to maintain strong cost control that they have done in the last two years."

The overhang in the aqua feed segment due to high input cost and low pricing power in the shrimp feed segment seems to be stabilising a bit.The company has pared its raw material inventory levels to 15-20 days owing to volatile raw material prices, which is the case with competitors as well. This has made passing on costs easier and will boost/protect margin.  GAVL’s several R&D initiatives in the pipeline are also expected to benefit this segment in the long run.NoneThe company has created Rs 5 crore provision for receivables which hit the segment's margins. However, the management indicated that recoveries have been on an upswing with substantial improvement in January.The company has a healthy line-up of branded products in this high margin segment and has been investing in R&D to come up with new molecules, one of which is expected to be monetised in the current (January-March) quarter. To achieve rapid expansion, the management also indicated the possibility of inorganic expansion.NoneThe government has reduced the import duty on palm oil. Due to this, the domestic market is open for competition from international players. The soft import policy for palm oil stands to negatively impact the segment.The soft import policy for palm oil augurs well for international players who have a competitive advantage in the domestic market. The new CACP (Commission for Agriculture Cost and Pricing) is expected to come out with a uniform pricing policy for procurement of palm fruit bunches. Currently, the price varies from the state-wise. The company has split its procurement area between Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana. Last season saw high price of fruit bunches in Telangana versus AP, as a result of which the procurement cost went up as many AP farmers sold their produce in Telangana.GAVL has invested in new technology that would help in improving the oil extraction ratio from fruit bunches (from 17 to 18-18.5 percent).Palm oil business is another high margin segment and the management indicated intentions of growing rapidly inorganically. The company had participated in the Ruchi Soya bidding and similar opportunities cannot be ruled out.NoneNoneNoneThe GAVL stock has seen a noticeable correction after the management commentary after its result, taking it close to its listing price. It is now trading at 25 times estimated earnings for FY20. The long-term growth story for the company remains intact and we remain positive about the company’s successful execution of segment-wise business strategies.Follow @RuchiagrawalNone"

content,"The gaming industry in India is booming, all set to cross the $1.1 billion mark by the end of 2020. What we can interestingly see, as well, is the rise in smartphone users in the country that is expected to cross 530 million by the end of this year. Today, the gaming industry is amongst the fastest growing entertainment industry with over 10% growth while the other sources like television has gone down by eight percent.It is not just the global giants who are reaping benefits of this magic combination but a range of upcoming startups as well.How the Play Zone has ChangedGaming came into the Indian scenario in the 1990s. However, the accessibility to play games was a challenge. From installation to accessing them on the desktops, there seem to be too many limitations and less of opportunities to enjoy a game. But the smartphone usage has changed this completely. Online games can now be easily downloaded and enjoyed on devices.The other factor that contributed to the acceptance of games on almost every smartphone is the affordable data packs with the coming of Jio. With smooth WiFi, easy and unlimited data packs, our screens have now become our virtual gaming space.The New Game FormatsThe attraction towards multiple gaming formats also share a strong contribution to the rise of games in India. Adding to this craze is the mobile-friendly version or mobile games, which give the player an opportunity to play anywhere and anytime. What adds thrill to the entire package is the real money games that are now easily available to the Indian player.NoneWe see new game formats coming out just about every day and the form of spending leisure time is now moving away from television to these new games.The online gaming industry is coming up with innovative formats every day. They are transforming the entire entertainment sector, which is now shifting from TV sets to mobile handsets. The new gaming formats hold immense potential for game developers and graphic designers as they are using cutting-edge technology to accelerate the industry’s growth this year.Opening the Doors WideNoneWho is the Player?When we talk about the complete mobile experience it is not complete without games. So, what makes a player download games and invest cash in it as well. It depends on the social quotient. Consumers learn about games from friends and family and think about giving it a shot. Exploring games on the mobile is just about a few taps and consumers don’t hesitate to try it out. As per a recent Google report, there are over 27% players who select mobile games after giving it some thought. There is another 16% who stop spending money on games when their friends move to some other game. Further, there are the playful explorers who simply connects with other players within the mobile game to get more items or prizes.None"

title,Here are 4 ways to create an all-weather portfolio
datetime,2019-02-18 14:24:00+00:00
description,An all-weather portfolio is designed to manage the risk as you create wealth in the long term
content,"Vaibhav AgrawalWhat exactly is an all-weather portfolio? Obviously, it is not a portfolio that will outperform under all conditions. An all-weather portfolio is actually the one which has an element of ‘alpha’ and ‘risk management’ built into it.That means in good times, the portfolio does not really perform better than an aggressive portfolio. On the contrary, it ensures that the portfolio performs better than the benchmark index.But, the more important aspect of an all-weather portfolio is that it does better than the index in a falling market. You don’t really compare an all-weather portfolio to a short fund on the downside, but it does better than the index (falls less).What this means is that over a period of time as cycles get evened out, the all-weather portfolio does better than the index by a margin. But, more importantly, it is a portfolio that carries lesser risk than a pure alpha portfolio.An all-weather portfolio is, therefore, designed to manage the risk as you create wealth in the long term. There are occasions when equities will perform better and there are times when debt will perform better.Let us also compare the merits of an all-weather portfolio vs a pure alpha portfolio. Here is how you can go about creating an all-weather portfolio.1. Most of your risk can be managed through diversification:Irrespective of the asset class that you invest in, there is risk involved. Let us look at some key asset classes. Equity carries market risk and debt has interest rate risk.Even a portfolio of commodities is vulnerable to price risk and cyclical risk. There is a lot of merit in diversification. For example, equities and gold typically enjoy a negative correlation.That means gold tends to perform better when equities are underperforming. So if you add a small portion of gold to your portfolio, it can become a good hedge in tough times. That is how diversification becomes useful.Creating an all-weather portfolio begins with diversifying your risk across asset classes to capitalize on more economic probabilities. The beauty is that you can assign subjective probabilities to various asset classes and tweak your asset mix accordingly.2. Alternatively, you opt for balanced funds or dynamic funds:A Balanced fund typically mixes debt and equity to give a flavour of wealth creation and stable income. These balanced funds have an in-built all-weather flavour to them. It is not just a plain vanilla product.Within balanced funds, you can choose between equity balanced funds and monthly income plan (MIPs) and you can also opt for fixed maturity plans or FMPs if you are willing to get locked into a closed-ended fund.You may complain that these balanced funds still leave you with a problem of choice as you are not able to decide whether you want equities to predominate or debt. The option could be dynamic funds, where the fund manager will do this job for you.Here is how a dynamic fund will work. Your fund can base this dynamic on transparent rules. For example, if the index P/E goes above the threshold then you automatically reduce your equity exposure and if the P/E goes below a certain threshold then you increase equity exposure.You can have similar rules for debt too. For example, if rates are looking dovish then let long-dated debt predominate your portfolio and you can shift to floating rate funds or liquid funds where the interest rate risk rises with a rise in yields.You can also set similar rules for gold and other commodities. Dynamic can be a good form of actively managed asset allocation, provided it is done by an expert fund manager.3. Gold and commodities are solid hedges to your portfolio:You obviously cannot consider gold as a full-fledged investment class. But it does have a role to play in hedging your risk. Therefore, allocation of 10-15 percent of your portfolio to gold is advisable and you can tweak this range based on the level of volatility in equity markets.It is an inverse relationship between equity volatility and gold prices. Even within gold as an asset class, you have a wide choice of instruments. Instead of physical gold, you can prefer the more convenient gold bonds or gold ETFs. They are virtual proxies for physical gold.Gold automatically outperforms in turbulent market conditions and thus gives you a hedge against negative returns on asset classes like equity and debt. Gold has been uncorrelated with traditional assets like equity and that is a genuine advantage.We shall not spend too much time on other commodities as they are yet to emerge as a distinct class in India. The reason they are important is that industrial commodities follow a longer down cycle and up cycle and hence they are a lot more predictable.Of course, you can invest in commodities through commodity stocks or through global commodity funds. Global commodity funds are a good method as they represent raw commodities.4. Finally, systematic investing works as an all-weather strategy:Whether you are buying equities or equity funds; phased investing works best. It is passive and you don’t have to worry about timing the peaks and troughs of the market.When you adopt a phased approach, the concept of rupee cost averaging works in your favour and over time your average cost ends up lower. This is helpful in all market conditions.The moral of the story is that creating an all-weather portfolio is nothing like rocket science. Get the four pillars of diversification, low correlation, dynamic allocation and phased approach in place. The rest of the story will follow logically!(The author is Head of Research & ARQ at Angel Broking Ltd)"

Breaking protocol, PM @narendramodi personally recieves HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia as he arrives on his first bilateral visit to India!""The Saudi leader had returned to Riyadh from Pakistan.He and Modi will hold extensive talks on Wednesday during which India is likely to strongly raise the issue of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.According a warm welcome, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday not only received the Crown Prince at the airport in Islamabad but also drove him to PM house.During their talks on Wednesday, Modi and Salman are also expected to look at ways to enhancing defence ties, including having a joint naval exercise, official sources said.According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Crown Prince will leave New Delhi around 11:50 PM on Wednesday.His visit comes in the backdrop of the escalating tension between India and Pakistan following the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror group in which 40 CRPF were killed.In a joint statement, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on Monday called for avoiding ""politicisation"" of the UN listing regime at a time when India was stepping up efforts to brand the JeM terror group's chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.The joint statement said the Saudi Crown Prince stressed that dialogue is the only way to ensure peace and stability in the region to resolve ""outstanding issues"" between India and Pakistan.Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said in Islamabad Riyadh will try to ""de-escalate"" tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pulwama attack.Official sources said Saudi Arabia was no longer accepting Pakistan's narrative on Kashmir and cross border terrorism and that India will forcefully raise the issue of Pakistan's support to terror groups during delegation level talks between Modi and the Crown Prince.They said the joint statement to be issued after talks between the two sides is likely to have strong reference about terrorism and ways to deal with it.Official sources said there has been a ""change"" in the way Saudi Arabia looked at relations between India and Pakistan and that the powerful Gulf nation has a better understanding of the cross-border terrorism.The sources said the two sides are looking at joint exercise between the two navies besides significantly ramping up overall defence cooperation.India's bilateral trade with Saudi Arabia was USD 27.48 billion in 2017-18, making Saudi Arabia its fourth largest trading partner.Saudi Arabia is also a key pillar of India's energy security, being a source of 17 per cent or more of crude oil and 32 per cent of LPG requirements of India.Recently, Saudi ARAMCO in partnership with ADNOC of UAE has agreed to partner in Ratnagiri Refinery and Petro-Chemical project Ltd which is a joint venture of USD 44 billion.Indian partners are IOC, BPCL and HPCL."

title,Morgan Stanley picks big four of Indian banking sector for 2019
datetime,2019-02-19 13:10:00+00:00
description,"Morgan Stanley feels large banks are relatively less exposed to IL&FS, telecoms, NBFCs,and real estate."
content,"Bigger banks have shown good improvement in asset quality in the quarter ended December 2018. After a couple of years of concerns, Q3 performance has given confidence to analysts to project a strong turnaround in FY20 earnings.Global research house Morgan Stanley views 2019 as the year of big banks given moderating credit costs with pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) acceleration and pickup in deposit market share.The research house highlighted a continuing improvement in asset quality, with bad loans ratio moving lower to around 10 percent of loans against around 12 percent in FY18 and coverage improving to more than 50 percent versus around 45 percent. This should drive moderation in credit costs to 90-125bps in FY20, it said in a report.It further said liquidity position of banks is also strong, with liquidity coverage ratio at around 120-140 percent. An increased focus on retail term deposits is driving deposit growth acceleration with large private banks' incremental deposit market share at over 30 percent in FY18-19.NoneMorgan Stanley believes PPoP growth is sustainable because loan spreads adjusted for this have also improved sharply (+25bp QoQ for private banks).NoneCoupled with pickup in loan growth and cost efficiency, the research house expects more than 20 percent PPoP growth.""Moreover, loan yields should improve further, reflecting a) full impact of MCLR hikes, b) moderation in NPLs, and c) improving loan spreads and also loan mix towards higher-margin segments,"" it added.The liquidity concerns raised after IL&FS issue hit non-banking finance companies as well as banks due to exposure to IL&FS group. However, Morgan Stanley feels large banks are relatively less exposed to IL&FS, telecoms, NBFCs, and real estate.""In a weak scenario of significant increase in stress in the above sectors, we estimate around 200-400bps rise in credit costs. Large banks face relatively lower impact, particularly ICICI Bank, followed by Axis Bank among corporate lenders,"" Morgan Stanley said in a report, adding the most affected are Yes Bank and state-owned banks but SBI is better placed in that group.NoneOn Yes Bank, the brokerage is still underweight given low capital, low liquidity coverage ratio, high exposure to stressed sectors and weakening PPoP.In case of SBI, Morgan Stanley expects 43 percent upside in stock at Rs 375 while in bull and bear case scenario, its target price would be Rs 545 and 205, respectively.""We apply probability weights of 75 percent to base case and 20 percent to bear case to reflect risks pertaining from SBI stepping forward to bail out funding-constrained NBFCs and/or state-owned banks. We still attach just a slight probability (5 percent) to bull case value, reflecting the low probability of a strong economic recovery. Our probability weights remain unchanged,"" it said."

description,"Not everyone was content with just an apology, and went on to slam the fashion house, while calling on people to boycott the brand"
content,"Jagyaseni BiswasThere is a generation of people with increasing sense of alienation, that’s driving them to struggle with various mental illnesses, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies. Then we have Pinterest and Instagram, social media platforms where any new fashion statement turns fast into trends, without introspection spared by those adopting them.In such testing times, it becomes all the more important for big fashion labels to promote trends responsibly, be it concerns of body positivity or otherwise. Doing quite the contrary, British luxury fashion house Burberry recently walked a model at the London fashion week wearing a hoodie with a noose hanging around the neck.Though the fashion brand has apologised now, what is worrisome is this was a collection reportedly dedicated ""to the youth"", as mentioned in an Instagram post that has been deleted.NoneNoneI usually ""attribute to incompetence rather than malice,"" but Burberry has me wondering if maybe some high end brands are actually deliberately trying to brand themselves as for-White-people-only-and-therefore-better when they release-and-promptly-drop a blatantly racist product.NoneNoneHowever, trying to explain where the idea came from, he added: ""Though the design was inspired by the marine theme that ran throughout the collection, it was insensitive and we made a mistake.""The alarming and disturbing content of the collection came to light when Burberry model Liz Kennedy, who took part in the very show but did not wear the garment, shared a detailed post on her Instagram account, expressing her disgust for the noose. Allegedly, she had raised her disapproval for the design prior to the Sunday show, but was dismissed after being told “it is fashion and that nobody cares about what's going on in her personal life, so she could keep it to herself”.That’s when the model decided to take to social media to raise an alarm about what could become a worrying trend. She began her post with: “Suicide is not fashion. It is not glamorous nor edgy and since this show is dedicated to the youth, expressing their voice, here I go.”She added: ""It is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway…I had asked to speak to someone about it but the only thing I was told to do was to write a letter.”Kennedy also claimed that the staff were hanging the noose from a ceiling and joking about it, before the show began.Marco Gobbetti told CNN, he called up Kennedy personally to apologise after he learnt about the product.Later, the show's designer and the fashion label’s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci also extended an apology. He said: ""I am so deeply sorry for the distress that has been caused as a result of one of the pieces in my show on Sunday. While the design was inspired by a nautical theme, I realize that it was insensitive. It was never my intention to upset anyone. It does not reflect my values nor Burberry's, and we have removed it from the collection. I will make sure that this does not happen again.""@burberry @riccardotisci17 Suicide is not fashion. It is not glamorous nor edgy and since this show is dedicated to the youth expressing their voice, here I go. Riccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway. How could anyone overlook this and think it would be okay to do this especially in a line dedicated to young girls and youth. The impressionable youth. Not to mention the rising suicide rates world wide. Let’s not forget about the horrifying history of lynching either. There are hundreds of ways to tie a rope and they chose to tie it like a noose completely ignoring the fact that it was hanging around a neck. A massive brand like Burberry who is typically considered commercial and classy should not have overlooked such an obvious resemblance. I left my fitting extremely triggered after seeing this look (even though I did not wear it myself). Feeling as though I was right back where I was when I was going through an experience with suicide in my family. Also to add in they briefly hung one from the ceiling (trying to figure out the knot) and were laughing about it in the dressing room. I had asked to speak to someone about it but the only thing I was told to do was to write a letter. I had a brief conversation with someone but all that it entailed was “it’s fashion. Nobody cares about what’s going on in your personal life so just keep it to yourself” well I’m sorry but this is an issue bigger than myself. The issue is not about me being upset, there is a bigger picture here of what fashion turns a blind eye to or does to gain publicity. A look so ignorantly put together and a situation so poorly handled. I am ashamed to have been apart of the show. #burberry. I did not post this to disrespect the designer or the brand but to simply express an issue I feel very passionate about.A post shared by"

title,Revealed: How IL&FS took Gurgaon Metro for a Rs 300-crore ride
datetime,2019-02-20 19:34:00+00:00
description,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) today raided former officials of IL&FS and one of its subsidiaries. The FIR, which forms the basis of investigation, reveals the modus operandi of how it siphoned money."
content,"NoneThe case of the ED, which filed an enforcement case investigation report (ECIR), is based on a first information report (FIR) filed by the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police in December last year. The latter lays bare the modus operandi through which IL&FS siphoned out roughly Rs 300 crore over a period of several years through fake orders issued as part of the construction of the Gurgaon Rapid Metro.IL&FS and its subsidiaries completed construction of both phases of the Gurgaon Metro, in 2013 and 2017, respectively.According to the FIR, IL&FS’ subsidiary IL&FS Rail Infra issued work orders to a string of companies for non-existent work, namely Silverpoint Infratech, Suryamukhi Projects, NKG Infrastructure, Divyanshi Infra Project and Ethical Construction, among others.“The task assigned to these bogus companies was to generate cash and hand over the same to the persons accepting those bogus invoices as genuine,” the FIR said.The discrepancy was first noticed by the Income-Tax Department, which in May 2018, had issued a demand notice to IL&FS Rail, seeking clarity on unexplained expenditure.For instance, in its I-T Department’s own investigation, it found that Silverpoint Infratech “did not have proper office or staff to execute such infra project.”“The income tax raised concern that company having a gross receipt of Rs 251 crore would have the meagre expenditure of only Rs 22 lakh on salaries. In assessment of IL&FS Rail, they failed to provide even measurement book duly signed by site engineer,” the FIR says.Moneycontrol also reviewed a copy of the FIR and the show-cause notice issued by the Income Tax Department to IL&FS Rail, which pegs the total amount of unexplained expenditure at Rs 980 crore.The showcause notice says IL&FS Rail was not able to explain the expenditure.The ED’s FIR says that Sanjay Kumar Drolia, Managing Director of Silverpoint Infrapoint (one of the companies working with IL&FS), categorically accepted that he and his company was involved in providing the accommodation entries to earn commission income to tune of 0.50 percent. Drolia was arrested by the ED recently.“It is on the account of such fake invoices that the cost of the projects implemented by company are significantly higher than the comparable project of Delhi Metro and Rail Corporation,” the FIR said.NoneThe FIR in this case was filed following a complaint by Ashish Begwani, Director of Enso Infrastructure Private Limited, which holds a 15 percent stake in IL&FS Rail."

The default led to a liquidity crunch in the financial system and threatened to trigger a contagion.Ashish Begwani, Director of Enso Infrastructures (P) Ltd, had filed the case against officials of IL&FS Rail for allegedly causing Rs 70 crore loss to his company by fraudulent means. Begwani had alleged in his complaint that in August 2010, he was approached by two officials of IL&FS Transportation Networks and he had invested Rs 170 crore in IL&FS Rail, a special purpose vehicle for Gurugram Metro project, in order to take its 15 per cent shares.""However, over a period of time, the complainant observed that the company is not performing profitably and funds are being misused,"" an EOW official had said quoting Begwani's complaint.The ED will probe if funds generated illegally in this case, were laundered to create illegitimate assets by the accused."

title,BJP's Look East policy | West Bengal: Saffron party all set to take on Mamata Banerjee's TMC head-on
datetime,2019-02-21 11:06:00+00:00
description,This the second instalment of a three-part series on how the BJP looks to offset losses in the North with gains in the East
content,"On February 3, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee started a dharna (sit-in protest) over the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)'s attempt to question Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with the Sarada chit fund scam case.Banerjee claimed that the central investigative agency had knocked on the doors of Kumar without a search warrant.She also said that she was staging the dharna to protest 'insults' she faced at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National President Amit Shah. She alleged they wanted to impose President's Rule in all states where the Opposition was in power.NoneBJP has accused Banerjee of attempting to scuttle their poll campaign in the state.The event was seen by political commentators as the first major confrontation between Narendra Modi-led BJP, which is ramping up its presence in the state, and Banerjee-led TMC.BJP’s Bengal outreachThe BJP has been holding rallies and sending its top leaders to the state as it hopes to make electoral gains in the eastern, southern and northeastern regions of the country in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. For the BJP, these gains would help offset some of the losses it is expected to face in the ‘Hindi heartland’ states.In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the Modi-led party swept through the Hindi-speaking belt.Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chandigarh and the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi have a total of 226 parliamentary seats. The BJP won 191 of these seats in 2014. Its partners from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 11 seats there. 2014 Lok Sabha Polls_ BJP's region wise seat shareIn December 2018, Congress was able to wrest Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan from the BJP in one-on-one contests in the assembly elections largely banking local anti-incumbency and agrarian distress.The saffron party is now facing similar anti-incumbency in many other northern states leading observers to believe that it is likely to face substantial losses. Observers also highlight the lack of a ‘Modi wave’ that had swelled BJP’s vote share in 2014.Opinion polls concur with these observations. Multiple polls have predicted BJP making heavy losses in the Hindi-speaking belt.The Samajwadi Party (SP)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance could cut down BJP’s tally to half in Uttar Pradesh alone, the surveys show.The East and Northeast have been untapped regions for the BJP as far as parliamentary constituencies are concerned. So, it is here that the saffron party is desperate to make gains.The region, comprising Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura, has a total of 88 seats. The BJP had won just 13 of these Lok Sabha seats in 2014. Its allies had won two.In Odisha and West Bengal, BJP won one and two seats respectively, leaving scope for a major expansion.West Bengal politicsThe politics of West Bengal was dominated by the Indian National Congress and the Bangla Congress (United) till the mid-1970s. Subsequently, the state became a stronghold of the Left Front. Jyoti Basu occupied the top office in the state from 1977 to 2000 — making him the second longest-serving chief minister in the country.Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took over the reign in 2000 and continued until 2011 when Banerjee stormed to power.Over the years, the Left’s influence and electoral performance has tanked. The 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 2016 West Bengal assembly election were a corroboration of the Left’s collapse.The BJP has never commanded significant support in the eastern state. However, the party has been on an upswing over the last five years. With Banerjee completing eight years in power in May, local anti-incumbency could also start to play a role.The state has a total of 42 constituencies. Banerjee’s All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) had bagged 34 out of these in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Congress and the Left had won four and two respectively. The BJP won two seats. West Bengal: Lok Sabha polls vote shareSaffron chargeIn the 2016 West Bengal Assembly election, the BJP had won three seats, up from zero in 2011. However, its vote share shot up to 10.16 percent from 4.06 percent.In 2017, the BJP stamped itself as the number two party in West Bengal. While the TMC won 140 out of the 148 wards in seven civic bodies, the BJP won six. However, it was able to trounce the Left Front and the Congress convincingly. One Left and an Independent candidate won; Congress could not win any.Less than a year later, in May 2018, BJP made inroads into Purulia and Jhargram districts — former Maoist bastions.TMC won over 21,000 gram panchayat seats. BJP scooped up over 5,700 to cement its position as number two. More importantly, the BJP left the CPM and the Congress behind yet again. West Bengal: Lok Sabha polls seat share200 rallies, top leaders involvedThe BJP has been making serious attempts to boost its Lok Sabha seat tally in the state, banking on the new-found support.NoneNoneThe apex court denied permission, saying apprehension of the state government of possible law and order situation cannot be called ""unfounded"" and BJP will have to take all possible steps to address the apprehension in a reasonable manner.The two parliamentary seats and 17.02 percent vote share won by the saffron party in 2014 seems to be a pivot for its performance in 2019.The party had finished second in three seats and third in a whopping 30 seats in 2014. That adds up to 33 seats where the BJP is quickly emerging as an alternative.Some of these constituencies include: Maldaha Dakshin, Kolkata Dakshin, Kolkata Uttar, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Barrackpore, Dum Dum, Basirhat, Diamond Harbour, Jadavpur, Howrah, Hooghly, Jhargram, Medinipur, Bardhaman Purba, Burdwan–Durgapur, Bolpur and Birbhum.The BJP would be focusing on these areas.The saffron party would also be looking at the tribal seats which fall along the Bihar border.Opinion polls concur with the aforementioned trend. The ABP News-CVoter survey from November 2018 shows BJP winning nine seats, up from two seats.A Republic TV-CVoter survey from January shows the NDA winning seven seats. The same survey shows the BJP-led alliance bagging at 31.8 percent vote share — significantly more than the Left and Congress combine. The survey predicted TMC to win 34, same as the 2014 result.The BJP has not announced an alliance with any regional party in West Bengal so far.The Citizenship Bill conundrumThe saffron party was pushing for The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. The bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal immigrants (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) eligible for Indian citizenship.NoneThe bill had faced strong resistance and sparked widespread protests across the Northeast.Many parties protesting against this bill are BJP allies. Passing of the bill in Lok Sabha in the Winter Session pushed one of its allies — the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) — to quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).Political experts believe the BJP could face severe losses in the Northeast due to the unpopularity of the bill. It remains unclear if some section in the region would reconcile with the saffron party as the bill is set to lapse.Some observers believe that the Bill’s pros for the BJP in West Bengal outweigh the cons in the Northeast.However, Partha Das, psephologist and analyst at political consultancy Chanakyya, told Moneycontrol, “There seems to be no electoral strategy behind this (the Citizenship (Amendment) bill). This is only ideological just like the Ram Mandir issue.”“The BJP is looking to gain in the areas along the Bangladesh border which has significant Hindu-Bengali population,” Das said.“It is a risk that they are taking. Mamata [Banerjee] will not join the NDA (in a post-poll scenario). But Naveen Patnaik can,” he added, highlighting why BJP has no hesitation in trying to make inroads into West Bengal.Das also believes BJP’s entry in the state will not be smooth. “There are cultural and linguistic differences between the Hindi heartland states and West Bengal. These are still hurdles for the BJP.”“They have a chance in seven seats, at best. I think their tally will be maximum six. In 2014, they had won two. So, the gains are not great. This will not offset the losses (of the North).”While a possible Left Front-Congress alliance may not be able to take on the TMC, it could work as a ‘vote-cutter’ against BJP. A Left-Congress could hope to attract anti-TMC voters, who would have otherwise voted for BJP.“The Left-Congress alliance will happen. It will take time, but it will happen. Otherwise, they will not survive (in the state),” Das said."

content,"NoneNone""Around 7,000 firms will get an immediate benefit. It would be many more over time. Many companies on our list have grown beyond just being startups and fall in the tax bracket,"" sources added.These include smaller firms that were unable to raise funds from angel investors due to tax fears. The official based this estimation on the self-declarations by startups at the time of registration.Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the report.Startups can pick significant investments from non-resident Indians and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) after these new norms. This amount will not count towards the Rs 25 crore limit. Also, the government waived off the requirement for the average returned income of the investor to be Rs 50 lakh for the financial year preceding the date of tax filing.""This helps angels to invest in startups on merit without worrying about unnecessary documentation or being question by the Income Tax Department. We expect larger angel involvements and platforms like the Indian Angel Network (IAN) and others will be able to attract a wider pool of investors from India and globally,"" Vipul Sharma, CEO of Chqbook, a fintech startup, told the newspaper.Industry players expect more high net worth individuals to turn angel investors, as the process gets simpler with the new norms. They even expect investment in startups to double if the markets remain stable. Reports suggest that angel investment in early-age startups in 2018 was nearly $5.5 billion."

description,The strike has coincided with the ramp-up plans for the Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650.
content,"NoneNoneThough the management at Eicher Motors did not shed light on the loss in production, it has already declared the strike as illegal. Royal Enfield had cut FY19 production guidance by 25,000 units to 9.25 lakh.This is due to the earlier 50-day strike that took place in September last year; and along with a general slowdown in demand, including a slump from one of Royal Enfield's biggest markets - Kerala.NoneRoyal Enfield workers are demanding regularisation of all workers who complete 480 days of work besides revoking of all transfer orders.As per a 2012 order of the Madras High Court, a workman, who has rendered a continuous service of 480 days in a period of 24 calendar months should be conferred with permanent status in an establishment.Workers are also asking for a provision of bonus for everyone working for more than a month. Another demand of the workers is that trainees employed through National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), an initiative by the Government of India, should not be given work suitable for permanent employees.The Union at Royal Enfield's Oragadam plant in a statement on February 19, said that the factory employs 5,559 workers, including 1,059 permanent workers, 2,000 contract workers, 1,000 trainees and 1,500 trainees  employed through NEEM.The previous strike resulted in a production loss of nearly 30,000 units for the niche bike maker which makes models under the brands Classic, Himalayan and Thunderbird. Production of the 650 twin bikes, the costliest bikes from Royal Enfield, was to be raised to 5,000 units a month by end of March as against around 2,500 units at present."

title,Many stocks trade below their 5-year average PE; are they value buys?
datetime,2019-02-20 14:27:00+00:00
description,"In growth and valuation matrix, usually high growth with high peer valuations proves to be a better investing avenue, suggest experts."
content,"The hunger for more returns usually makes investors hunt for stocks which are available at cheaper valuations compared to their historic multiples.There are as many as 190 stocks on BSE that are trading below their historic 5-year average PE. 29 out of those 190 stocks have given positive returns in the last one year, data from AceEquity showed.The list includes Astrazeneca Pharma, Pfizer, United Breweries, Ipca Laboratories, Dr. Reddy’s Labs, Mphasis, Kaveri Seed, HCL Technologies, 3M India, Jubilant Foodworks and Apollo Hospitals.Analysts advise investors to use low P/E stocks as a filter for shortlisting investment ideas and use other quantitative parameters before investing. It is common for people to mistake low P/E stocks to be value stocks but that may be a slightly misleading approach to value investing.NoneNoneNormally value stocks are those that offer a substantial margin of safety which is defined by an extent to which the market price of the stock is below the intrinsic value of the stock.For stocks which are trading below their respective PE multiple, investors should also look at the reason why the stock fell in the first place. What is the earnings outlook for the next few quarters and was there any business irregularity.“If the stock is trading below its 5-year Avg PE then investors should remember a couple of key points. Watch out for these factors before investing in such companies: a) any impact on the product/business due any headwinds b) Profits or revenues growing or not, and c) whether there are any corporate governance or compliance issues with the company in recent history,” Yogesh Mehta, VP, retail research, Motilal Oswal Securities told Moneycontrol.“Any companies trading below 5-year Avg PE and also pass the filters given above investors should see if there is growth potential. If the revenue growth scale is visible with the same rate, any capacity expansion already done or will be done in near future (next 6-12 months) or opening new stores (with respect to Retail sector companies) and likely to deliver growth,” he said.The important factor to look at before investing is ‘growth’, suggest experts. In growth and valuation matrix, usually high growth with high peer valuations prove to be a better investing avenue, suggest experts.Market tends to reward stocks which have growth potential. As many as 170 stocks which are trading above their 5-year average PEs. Out of those, 52 companies have delivered returns ranging from 10-85 percent in the last one year.Stocks which are trading above their respective 5-year avg PE and also gave positive returns include names like V-Mart, Bata India, Divi’s Laboratories, NIIT Technologies, TCS, HUL, Infosys, Dabur India, Tech Mahindra, Titan Company and Radico Khaitan, data from AceEquity showed.“At the time of picking stock for investment purposes, one has to understand the business, its operating environment and management strategy for the future. At times of retarding growth, a lower P/E may hint you to stay away from investing,” Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research, Narnolia Financial Advisors told Moneycontrol.“High valuations (TTM PE> 5-Year Avg PE) depict investors’ confidence in the business/ management of a company. A high valuation is a risk only when the future appears unclear,” she said.Sharma further added that a company where return ratios like ROE/ROCE are high and have good capital allocation strategy may still be held even when valuations are higher. One may pick stocks from consumer space, Retail or IT where valuations may be rich but the business environment looks promising.NoneNoneParameters to consider before investingLooking at PE multiple is a common filter used by investors for shortlisting stocks. But, investors should also look at other financial ratios such as Return on Equity (RoE), asset turnover, margins, working capital turnover as well as free cash flows to profits may be other parameters in shortlisting stocks.ROE or return on equity is the return what you earn for equity shareholders, and ROCE (return on capital employed) measures what you earn for all providers of capital. Theory suggests that both ROE and the ROCE must be growing above the industry mean.“Apart from PE there are factors such as and then Return on Equity (RoE) and RoCE, Free cash flow, reserves, dividend payout ratio (from the profits but generally Retail companies are capex oriented hence they are exception), PEG ratio (i.e PE to Growth), CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate), these are some of the parameters to track before shortlisting companies but first and foremost is check management credibility and capability as well as experience in their businesses,” says Mehta of Motilal Oswal Securities."

datetime,2019-02-21 16:19:00+00:00
description,"Along with the folding phone, Samsung also added new cameras and a 5G version to its Galaxy series of phones."
content,"Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on February 20 unveiled a nearly $2,000 folding smartphone in a bid to top the technology of Apple Inc and Chinese rivals and reignite consumer interest amid slumping sales.The Galaxy Fold will go on sale on April 26 and take advantage of new and faster 5G mobile networks. The device looks similar to a conventional smartphone, but then opens like a book to reveal a display the size of a small tablet at 7.3 inches (18.5 cm).The device ""answers sceptics who said that everything that could be done has been done,"" DJ Koh, chief executive of Samsung Electronics, said at an event in San Francisco. ""We are here to prove them wrong.""Samsung remains the world's largest smartphone maker with nearly a fifth of global unit sales but underperformed a slumping market last year. Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd - whose Mate series of phones also command premium prices - gained market share. Other Chinese makers like Xiaomi Corp have also been increasing prices, leaving Samsung to defend its turf against upstart rivals in addition to its longtime foe Apple.With the foldable phone, Samsung is going on the offence on two fronts in the smartphone race: It is offering an eye-catching new feature with the big, bending screen and the first 5G connection in a premium phone, a feature analysts do not expect Apple to match until 2020.Here's the full video of the event where the announcements on Galaxy Fold start after 33 minutes and on Galaxy S10 they start after 55 minutes:NoneSamsung is also making improvements to its flagship Galaxy S devices and plans to offer a 4G version of its folding phone.It also challenges the notion of what a phone can cost, debuting at nearly twice the price of current top-of-the-line models from Apple and Samsung itself.Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, said the new folding device could help Samsung stay at the top and lure consumers to upgrade devices that have looked largely the same over the past five years.""Samsung and Apple go back and forth"" to lead the premium smartphone market, Moorhead said. ""I think this is Samsung's chance to take back the innovation crown.""And even though the $1,980 starting price is steep, some dedicated Samsung fans said they would pay it. Navneet Kumar Singh, a Samsung enthusiast from India who travelled to San Francisco to watch the launch, is ready to place his order.""The prices of the flagship models have been a little aggressive in India,"" he said, ""But in the end, if you invest the money you're getting a different experience.""Samsung also introduced several accessories to compete against Apple, including a pair of wireless headphones called Galaxy Buds. The headphones include wireless charging, a feature that Apple has promised to put into is competing AirPods but has not yet released.Samsung also said that its new Galaxy phones will be able to wirelessly charge its headphones and new smartwatches by setting the accessories on the back of the phone.10 times fasterAlong with the folding phone, Samsung also added new cameras and a 5G version to its Galaxy series of phones.Verizon Communications Inc will be the first carrier to offer service for Samsung's 5G phones. The networks are expected to be 10 times faster than current ones, improving viewing of live news and sports events.With the 5G versions of its flagships, the Korean electronics maker looks to have beaten Chinese rivals in the 5G race, although the device will operate only on the small number of networks launching later this year. Apple is not expected to release a 5G smartphone until late 2020.The new networks are not available in many places yet but will roll out this year and next. Consumers who want to hold on to their phones for several years before upgrading may be tempted to buy a 5G phone now so that it will be able to take advantage of those networks later, said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. That could sway some Apple buyers over to Samsung and other Android makers with 5G devices.""People are going to be thinking about, am going to be able to use this a year from now? Two years from now? Three years?"" he said.Rival smartphone makers are expected to announce 5G models at next week's Mobile World Congress, the industry's top annual event, in Spain. Samsung said its 5G handset would be available in the early summer.The Galaxy 10 series needs to appeal to consumers who are reluctant to upgrade for only incremental technological improvements in performance.Pricing and availabilityThe Galaxy Fold is priced at $1,980 and will go on sale on April 26. All of the Galaxy series of rigid phones except the 5G will be available from March 8, with the S10+ priced from $1,000, the S10 priced from $900 and the smaller S10e from $750."

title,"Burberry apologises for ‘suicide’ hoodie, but tweeple believe that’s not enough"
datetime,2019-02-21 13:45:00+00:00
description,"Not everyone was content with just an apology, and went on to slam the fashion house, while calling on people to boycott the brand"
content,"Jagyaseni BiswasThere is a generation of people with increasing sense of alienation, that’s driving them to struggle with various mental illnesses, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies. Then we have Pinterest and Instagram, social media platforms where any new fashion statement turns fast into trends, without introspection spared by those adopting them.In such testing times, it becomes all the more important for big fashion labels to promote trends responsibly, be it concerns of body positivity or otherwise. Doing quite the contrary, British luxury fashion house Burberry recently walked a model at the London fashion week wearing a hoodie with a noose hanging around the neck.Though the fashion brand has apologised now, what is worrisome is this was a collection reportedly dedicated ""to the youth"", as mentioned in an Instagram post that has been deleted.NoneNoneI usually ""attribute to incompetence rather than malice,"" but Burberry has me wondering if maybe some high end brands are actually deliberately trying to brand themselves as for-White-people-only-and-therefore-better when they release-and-promptly-drop a blatantly racist product.NoneNoneHowever, trying to explain where the idea came from, he added: ""Though the design was inspired by the marine theme that ran throughout the collection, it was insensitive and we made a mistake.""The alarming and disturbing content of the collection came to light when Burberry model Liz Kennedy, who took part in the very show but did not wear the garment, shared a detailed post on her Instagram account, expressing her disgust for the noose. Allegedly, she had raised her disapproval for the design prior to the Sunday show, but was dismissed after being told “it is fashion and that nobody cares about what's going on in her personal life, so she could keep it to herself”.That’s when the model decided to take to social media to raise an alarm about what could become a worrying trend. She began her post with: “Suicide is not fashion. It is not glamorous nor edgy and since this show is dedicated to the youth, expressing their voice, here I go.”She added: ""It is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway…I had asked to speak to someone about it but the only thing I was told to do was to write a letter.”Kennedy also claimed that the staff were hanging the noose from a ceiling and joking about it, before the show began.Marco Gobbetti told CNN, he called up Kennedy personally to apologise after he learnt about the product.Later, the show's designer and the fashion label’s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci also extended an apology. He said: ""I am so deeply sorry for the distress that has been caused as a result of one of the pieces in my show on Sunday. While the design was inspired by a nautical theme, I realize that it was insensitive. It was never my intention to upset anyone. It does not reflect my values nor Burberry's, and we have removed it from the collection. I will make sure that this does not happen again.""@burberry @riccardotisci17 Suicide is not fashion. It is not glamorous nor edgy and since this show is dedicated to the youth expressing their voice, here I go. Riccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway. How could anyone overlook this and think it would be okay to do this especially in a line dedicated to young girls and youth. The impressionable youth. Not to mention the rising suicide rates world wide. Let’s not forget about the horrifying history of lynching either. There are hundreds of ways to tie a rope and they chose to tie it like a noose completely ignoring the fact that it was hanging around a neck. A massive brand like Burberry who is typically considered commercial and classy should not have overlooked such an obvious resemblance. I left my fitting extremely triggered after seeing this look (even though I did not wear it myself). Feeling as though I was right back where I was when I was going through an experience with suicide in my family. Also to add in they briefly hung one from the ceiling (trying to figure out the knot) and were laughing about it in the dressing room. I had asked to speak to someone about it but the only thing I was told to do was to write a letter. I had a brief conversation with someone but all that it entailed was “it’s fashion. Nobody cares about what’s going on in your personal life so just keep it to yourself” well I’m sorry but this is an issue bigger than myself. The issue is not about me being upset, there is a bigger picture here of what fashion turns a blind eye to or does to gain publicity. A look so ignorantly put together and a situation so poorly handled. I am ashamed to have been apart of the show. #burberry. I did not post this to disrespect the designer or the brand but to simply express an issue I feel very passionate about.A post shared by"

title,Revealed: How IL&FS took Gurgaon Metro for a Rs 300-crore ride
datetime,2019-02-20 19:34:00+00:00
description,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) today raided former officials of IL&FS and one of its subsidiaries. The FIR, which forms the basis of investigation, reveals the modus operandi of how it siphoned money."
content,"NoneThe case of the ED, which filed an enforcement case investigation report (ECIR), is based on a first information report (FIR) filed by the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police in December last year. The latter lays bare the modus operandi through which IL&FS siphoned out roughly Rs 300 crore over a period of several years through fake orders issued as part of the construction of the Gurgaon Rapid Metro.IL&FS and its subsidiaries completed construction of both phases of the Gurgaon Metro, in 2013 and 2017, respectively.According to the FIR, IL&FS’ subsidiary IL&FS Rail Infra issued work orders to a string of companies for non-existent work, namely Silverpoint Infratech, Suryamukhi Projects, NKG Infrastructure, Divyanshi Infra Project and Ethical Construction, among others.“The task assigned to these bogus companies was to generate cash and hand over the same to the persons accepting those bogus invoices as genuine,” the FIR said.The discrepancy was first noticed by the Income-Tax Department, which in May 2018, had issued a demand notice to IL&FS Rail, seeking clarity on unexplained expenditure.For instance, in its I-T Department’s own investigation, it found that Silverpoint Infratech “did not have proper office or staff to execute such infra project.”“The income tax raised concern that company having a gross receipt of Rs 251 crore would have the meagre expenditure of only Rs 22 lakh on salaries. In assessment of IL&FS Rail, they failed to provide even measurement book duly signed by site engineer,” the FIR says.Moneycontrol also reviewed a copy of the FIR and the show-cause notice issued by the Income Tax Department to IL&FS Rail, which pegs the total amount of unexplained expenditure at Rs 980 crore.The showcause notice says IL&FS Rail was not able to explain the expenditure.The ED’s FIR says that Sanjay Kumar Drolia, Managing Director of Silverpoint Infrapoint (one of the companies working with IL&FS), categorically accepted that he and his company was involved in providing the accommodation entries to earn commission income to tune of 0.50 percent. Drolia was arrested by the ED recently.“It is on the account of such fake invoices that the cost of the projects implemented by company are significantly higher than the comparable project of Delhi Metro and Rail Corporation,” the FIR said.NoneThe FIR in this case was filed following a complaint by Ashish Begwani, Director of Enso Infrastructure Private Limited, which holds a 15 percent stake in IL&FS Rail."

content,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a case against former top officials of IL&FS, including its former chairman Ravi Parthasarathy, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The investigating body is carrying out raids at various offices of IL&FS, including its BKC, Mumbai office, and at the premises of the former officials.The case was registered following and FIR filed by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police and the SFIO report pointing out instances of misreporting of income, dubious transactions, conflict of interest, ever-greening of loans and personal enrichment of key employees.Infrastructure financier IL&FS was in the news last year when it defaulted on its obligations after accumulating a debt of Rs 92,000 crore. The default led to a liquidity crunch in the financial system and threatened to trigger a contagion.Ashish Begwani, Director of Enso Infrastructures (P) Ltd, had filed the case against officials of IL&FS Rail for allegedly causing Rs 70 crore loss to his company by fraudulent means. Begwani had alleged in his complaint that in August 2010, he was approached by two officials of IL&FS Transportation Networks and he had invested Rs 170 crore in IL&FS Rail, a special purpose vehicle for Gurugram Metro project, in order to take its 15 per cent shares.""However, over a period of time, the complainant observed that the company is not performing profitably and funds are being misused,"" an EOW official had said quoting Begwani's complaint.The ED will probe if funds generated illegally in this case, were laundered to create illegitimate assets by the accused."

title,BJP's Look East policy | West Bengal: Saffron party all set to take on Mamata Banerjee's TMC head-on
datetime,2019-02-21 11:06:00+00:00
description,This the second instalment of a three-part series on how the BJP looks to offset losses in the North with gains in the East
content,"On February 3, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee started a dharna (sit-in protest) over the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)'s attempt to question Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with the Sarada chit fund scam case.Banerjee claimed that the central investigative agency had knocked on the doors of Kumar without a search warrant.She also said that she was staging the dharna to protest 'insults' she faced at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) National President Amit Shah. She alleged they wanted to impose President's Rule in all states where the Opposition was in power.NoneBJP has accused Banerjee of attempting to scuttle their poll campaign in the state.The event was seen by political commentators as the first major confrontation between Narendra Modi-led BJP, which is ramping up its presence in the state, and Banerjee-led TMC.BJP’s Bengal outreachThe BJP has been holding rallies and sending its top leaders to the state as it hopes to make electoral gains in the eastern, southern and northeastern regions of the country in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. For the BJP, these gains would help offset some of the losses it is expected to face in the ‘Hindi heartland’ states.In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the Modi-led party swept through the Hindi-speaking belt.Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chandigarh and the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi have a total of 226 parliamentary seats. The BJP won 191 of these seats in 2014. Its partners from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 11 seats there. 2014 Lok Sabha Polls_ BJP's region wise seat shareIn December 2018, Congress was able to wrest Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan from the BJP in one-on-one contests in the assembly elections largely banking local anti-incumbency and agrarian distress.The saffron party is now facing similar anti-incumbency in many other northern states leading observers to believe that it is likely to face substantial losses. Observers also highlight the lack of a ‘Modi wave’ that had swelled BJP’s vote share in 2014.Opinion polls concur with these observations. Multiple polls have predicted BJP making heavy losses in the Hindi-speaking belt.The Samajwadi Party (SP)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance could cut down BJP’s tally to half in Uttar Pradesh alone, the surveys show.The East and Northeast have been untapped regions for the BJP as far as parliamentary constituencies are concerned. So, it is here that the saffron party is desperate to make gains.The region, comprising Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura, has a total of 88 seats. The BJP had won just 13 of these Lok Sabha seats in 2014. Its allies had won two.In Odisha and West Bengal, BJP won one and two seats respectively, leaving scope for a major expansion.West Bengal politicsThe politics of West Bengal was dominated by the Indian National Congress and the Bangla Congress (United) till the mid-1970s. Subsequently, the state became a stronghold of the Left Front. Jyoti Basu occupied the top office in the state from 1977 to 2000 — making him the second longest-serving chief minister in the country.Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took over the reign in 2000 and continued until 2011 when Banerjee stormed to power.Over the years, the Left’s influence and electoral performance has tanked. The 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the 2016 West Bengal assembly election were a corroboration of the Left’s collapse.The BJP has never commanded significant support in the eastern state. However, the party has been on an upswing over the last five years. With Banerjee completing eight years in power in May, local anti-incumbency could also start to play a role.The state has a total of 42 constituencies. Banerjee’s All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) had bagged 34 out of these in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Congress and the Left had won four and two respectively. The BJP won two seats. West Bengal: Lok Sabha polls vote shareSaffron chargeIn the 2016 West Bengal Assembly election, the BJP had won three seats, up from zero in 2011. However, its vote share shot up to 10.16 percent from 4.06 percent.In 2017, the BJP stamped itself as the number two party in West Bengal. While the TMC won 140 out of the 148 wards in seven civic bodies, the BJP won six. However, it was able to trounce the Left Front and the Congress convincingly. One Left and an Independent candidate won; Congress could not win any.Less than a year later, in May 2018, BJP made inroads into Purulia and Jhargram districts — former Maoist bastions.TMC won over 21,000 gram panchayat seats. BJP scooped up over 5,700 to cement its position as number two. More importantly, the BJP left the CPM and the Congress behind yet again. West Bengal: Lok Sabha polls seat share200 rallies, top leaders involvedThe BJP has been making serious attempts to boost its Lok Sabha seat tally in the state, banking on the new-found support.NoneNoneThe apex court denied permission, saying apprehension of the state government of possible law and order situation cannot be called ""unfounded"" and BJP will have to take all possible steps to address the apprehension in a reasonable manner.The two parliamentary seats and 17.02 percent vote share won by the saffron party in 2014 seems to be a pivot for its performance in 2019.The party had finished second in three seats and third in a whopping 30 seats in 2014. That adds up to 33 seats where the BJP is quickly emerging as an alternative.Some of these constituencies include: Maldaha Dakshin, Kolkata Dakshin, Kolkata Uttar, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Barrackpore, Dum Dum, Basirhat, Diamond Harbour, Jadavpur, Howrah, Hooghly, Jhargram, Medinipur, Bardhaman Purba, Burdwan–Durgapur, Bolpur and Birbhum.The BJP would be focusing on these areas.The saffron party would also be looking at the tribal seats which fall along the Bihar border.Opinion polls concur with the aforementioned trend. The ABP News-CVoter survey from November 2018 shows BJP winning nine seats, up from two seats.A Republic TV-CVoter survey from January shows the NDA winning seven seats. The same survey shows the BJP-led alliance bagging at 31.8 percent vote share — significantly more than the Left and Congress combine. The survey predicted TMC to win 34, same as the 2014 result.The BJP has not announced an alliance with any regional party in West Bengal so far.The Citizenship Bill conundrumThe saffron party was pushing for The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. The bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal immigrants (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) eligible for Indian citizenship.NoneThe bill had faced strong resistance and sparked widespread protests across the Northeast.Many parties protesting against this bill are BJP allies. Passing of the bill in Lok Sabha in the Winter Session pushed one of its allies — the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) — to quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).Political experts believe the BJP could face severe losses in the Northeast due to the unpopularity of the bill. It remains unclear if some section in the region would reconcile with the saffron party as the bill is set to lapse.Some observers believe that the Bill’s pros for the BJP in West Bengal outweigh the cons in the Northeast.However, Partha Das, psephologist and analyst at political consultancy Chanakyya, told Moneycontrol, “There seems to be no electoral strategy behind this (the Citizenship (Amendment) bill). This is only ideological just like the Ram Mandir issue.”“The BJP is looking to gain in the areas along the Bangladesh border which has significant Hindu-Bengali population,” Das said.“It is a risk that they are taking. Mamata [Banerjee] will not join the NDA (in a post-poll scenario). But Naveen Patnaik can,” he added, highlighting why BJP has no hesitation in trying to make inroads into West Bengal.Das also believes BJP’s entry in the state will not be smooth. “There are cultural and linguistic differences between the Hindi heartland states and West Bengal. These are still hurdles for the BJP.”“They have a chance in seven seats, at best. I think their tally will be maximum six. In 2014, they had won two. So, the gains are not great. This will not offset the losses (of the North).”While a possible Left Front-Congress alliance may not be able to take on the TMC, it could work as a ‘vote-cutter’ against BJP. A Left-Congress could hope to attract anti-TMC voters, who would have otherwise voted for BJP.“The Left-Congress alliance will happen. It will take time, but it will happen. Otherwise, they will not survive (in the state),” Das said."

Many companies on our list have grown beyond just being startups and fall in the tax bracket,"" sources added.These include smaller firms that were unable to raise funds from angel investors due to tax fears. The official based this estimation on the self-declarations by startups at the time of registration.Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the report.Startups can pick significant investments from non-resident Indians and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) after these new norms. This amount will not count towards the Rs 25 crore limit. Also, the government waived off the requirement for the average returned income of the investor to be Rs 50 lakh for the financial year preceding the date of tax filing.""This helps angels to invest in startups on merit without worrying about unnecessary documentation or being question by the Income Tax Department. We expect larger angel involvements and platforms like the Indian Angel Network (IAN) and others will be able to attract a wider pool of investors from India and globally,"" Vipul Sharma, CEO of Chqbook, a fintech startup, told the newspaper.Industry players expect more high net worth individuals to turn angel investors, as the process gets simpler with the new norms. They even expect investment in startups to double if the markets remain stable. Reports suggest that angel investment in early-age startups in 2018 was nearly $5.5 billion."

content,"NoneNoneThough the management at Eicher Motors did not shed light on the loss in production, it has already declared the strike as illegal. Royal Enfield had cut FY19 production guidance by 25,000 units to 9.25 lakh.This is due to the earlier 50-day strike that took place in September last year; and along with a general slowdown in demand, including a slump from one of Royal Enfield's biggest markets - Kerala.NoneRoyal Enfield workers are demanding regularisation of all workers who complete 480 days of work besides revoking of all transfer orders.As per a 2012 order of the Madras High Court, a workman, who has rendered a continuous service of 480 days in a period of 24 calendar months should be conferred with permanent status in an establishment.Workers are also asking for a provision of bonus for everyone working for more than a month. Another demand of the workers is that trainees employed through National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), an initiative by the Government of India, should not be given work suitable for permanent employees.The Union at Royal Enfield's Oragadam plant in a statement on February 19, said that the factory employs 5,559 workers, including 1,059 permanent workers, 2,000 contract workers, 1,000 trainees and 1,500 trainees  employed through NEEM.The previous strike resulted in a production loss of nearly 30,000 units for the niche bike maker which makes models under the brands Classic, Himalayan and Thunderbird. Production of the 650 twin bikes, the costliest bikes from Royal Enfield, was to be raised to 5,000 units a month by end of March as against around 2,500 units at present."

He had, however, also vowed taken action against his countrymen if they are found guilty of involvement in the attack, provided ""actionable intelligence"" is tabled.In a nationwide address highlighting the horrors of a war, Khan had said: ""If you (India) think you will attack us and we will not think of retaliating, you are wrong. We will have no other option other than retaliating. We all know starting a war is in the hands of humans, where it will lead us, only God knows.”Asserting that the incumbent Prime Minister only does what he is taught to do, Reham said: ""Imran Khan has been doing what he is taught to do. If he's saying he will take action, then he has to display and demonstrate something. We were on the way to be blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force [FATF], long before Pulwama terror attack happened."""

content,"Moneycontrol News Premier League's most intense rivalry renews when Liverpool travel to Old Trafford to lock horns with arch opponents Manchester United on February 24.The match comes at a critical juncture for both teams.With 65 points, the Reds are level on points with champions Manchester City but have a game in hand. A win over their arch-rivals will give them the required momentum in their push for the title.The Red Devils with 51 points in 26 outings currently sit fourth in the table, a spot above Arsenal who have 50 points with same number of matches. A win for them would strengthen their bid to secure a Champions League spot for next season.United overturned its 0-2 loss against PSG- its first loss under interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer-in Champions League by defeating Chelsea by the same margin in the FA Cup 5th round.Much was anticipated from Liverpool against Bayern at Anfield for its Champions League Round of 16 fixture, especially with the  form they were in. But the Bavarian defence held firm and managed to eke out a draw.Team NewsLiverpool will welcome back its ace defender Virgil Van Dijk back after he sat out against Bayern owing to a suspension. Van Djik's return in the playing XI ensures Fabiniho moves higher up to central midfield. Dejan Lovern continues to struggle with his long term injury issues. After playing only 18 minutes in the Champions League, James Milner could start against United. Joe Gomez and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain are still recovering from their respective injuries.In news from the United camp, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial are ruled out as they continue to nurse their injuries which they sustained against PSG. Solskjaer could again start with Romelu Lukaku and Juan Mata upfront and there could be a toss-up between Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly in United's back line.Possible XINoneNonePlayers to watch out forPaul Pogba (Manchester United)NonePaul Pogba continues his resurgence under Solskjaer. Against Chelsea in the FA Cup, the French midfielder again found the back of the net, taking his tally to 14 goals with 9 assists.  The 25-year-old comes alive in high profile fixtures and there is no bigger stage than a United-Liverpool clash. Pogba's dribbling, long shots and clinical finishing should come handy in United's pursuit to dent Liverpool's season.Virgil Van Dijk (Liverpool)NoneLiverpool's defence has been breached only 15 times this season. They have kept 14  clean sheets on top of it.  Liverpool's much improved rear guard action can be attributed to Van Dijk. Since his arrival at Merseyside, the 27-year-old Dutch has made up his name as one of the best defenders in the world.  His passing is great and aerial dual during set pieces make him  prized asset in any team.

content,"EA’s Apex Legends is gaining some steam with over 10 million players within 3-days of its release. The battle royale-style shooter is giving its more popular rivals PUBG and Fortnite a real run for its money with unique character-driven gameplay.Unlike traditional battle royale games - which involve survival and last-man standing gameplay - Apex Legends features a roster of eight characters in three different roles, each with their own unique ability.Twenty teams of three players are pitted against each other in a massive map. Players can choose between support, offensive and defensive characters. The key to victory in Apex Legends is getting the right balance for your team. Here’s a list of combinations that may help you get an edge in the battles –Gibraltar and Lifeline form the base of one of the most effective and reliable squad loadouts in the game. Lifeline’s healing drone coupled with Gibraltar shield is a highly versatile combination, protecting against incoming damage and at times blocking an enemies’ path. No, we haven’t missed out on the third squad member. Your team will have to decide the third member depending on your approach. Wraith works best in an aggressive setup, for a more focus driven approach to hide from or detect enemies, you’d want to go with Bloodhound, and finally, if you’re taking the defensive approach to lockdown areas, Caustic is your best bet.This team is all about speed – covering as much ground as possible as fast as possible. Each member of this team is gifted with an ability that allows them to flank an enemy or disengage from a battle as and when required. If used in tandem, Wraith, Bangalore and Pathfinder can take out the enemy without even giving them a chance to react.This team is engineered to cause chaos and confusion on the battlefield. Bangalore’s tactical smoke combined with Wraith’s voidwalking and Mirage’s tactical mirage skills will leave enemies utterly oblivious to where the bullets are coming from.

content,"Japanese carmaker Honda is geared up to launch its latest iteration of the Civic in a few days, marking the return of one of the most beloved cars in its lineup. While it retains its sedan structure, there are many updates which it has undergone.Since most of its details and specifications are out, Honda has made it clear that the Civic will be pitted against Skoda Octavia and Hyundai Elantra, among others. With its introduction to Indian shores lined up soon, here is a look at how the Honda Civic stacks up against its rivals.1.       DimensionsThe Civic commands the sportiest stance among the three, with the lowest height at 1433mm followed by the Elantra at 1465mm. Octavia stands tallest at 1476mm. Octavia, however, compensates its height with its large 590-litres boot space, while the Elantra gives 470-litres and the Civic comes in last with 430-litres of boot space. Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra are both tied on the wheelbase front at 2700mm whereas the Octavia falls short at 2688mm. The Civic sports the smallest fuel tank with 47 litres as opposed to Octavia and Elantra’s 50 litres each.2.       Power FiguresHonda has been liberal with the Civic’s powertrain, offering the petrol variant as an automatic only. However, it has retained its bulletproof 1.8-litre engine, which will pose as a fierce competitor to the rest. That said, its 1.5-litre diesel variant locks horns with the likes of Octavia’s 2-litre and Elantra’s 1.6-litre engines among others.The petrol Civic makes 140 BHP, coming in at the last place after Octavia’s 177 BHP and Elantra’s 150 BHP. The diesel variant though just manages to catch up with the Elantra as both are tied at 120 BHP. The Octavia diesel claims the top spot again with 141 BHP.3.       Safety and features"

title,Outlier: A quick view of Varun Beverages
datetime,2019-02-21 16:57:00+00:00
description,"Globally, most of the developed countries are shunning beverages with high calories. And consumers are moving towards more healthy drinks rather than carbonated drinks. "
content,"Shreesh BiradarNoneVarun Beverages was started by Ravi Kant Jaipuria as part of RJ Group. Varun Beverages has been associated with PepsiCo since 1990. It initially started as business associate of PepsiCo in select territories and has slowly expanded itself. Varun Beverages buys the franchisee rights from Pepsi for a territory and then sells the products in Pepsi Co name, effectively a bottling plant and reseller.Varun Beverages has been increasing number of licensed territories and sub-territories either by directly procuring it from Pepsi or acquiring the firm which has the rights.At the current juncture, PepsiCo is spread over 21 states in India apart from countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Morocco. Most of the growth has come in terms of inorganic expansion by acquiring new territories and expanding the distribution network. Varun beverages has more than 51 percent market share in Pepsi beverages in India. The India portfolio contributes nearly 75 percent of the revenue.VBL was unable to get a foothold in South Indian Market for a long time. It has recently acquired franchisee rights from SMV Group to manufacture PepsiCo beverages in 13 districts of Karnataka, 14 districts of Maharashtra and three districts of Madhya Pradesh. (Image source: Capitalmind)Varun Beverages currently has 20 manufacturing plants pan India and five manufacturing facilities in international geographies. Most of the manufacturing plants have been places to increase the reachability across their territory. Varun Beverages is currently serving 1/8th of the world's population and is the second biggest international franchise of PepsiCo.VBL has 75 depots across India with 2,100 owned vehicles and nearly 1,000 primary distributors. To incentivise the retail outlets VBL has provided the visi-coolers. By end of September VBL has distributed nearly 4,74,500 coolers.ProductsProducts of Varun Beverages can be classified into two divisions viz. Carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) and non-carbonated beverages (NCBs).Carbonated drinksCarbonated drinks include Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Mirinda, 7Up, 7Up Nimbooz Soda, Slice Fizzy Drinks and Everess. VBL has manufacturing and distribution rights for all the  carbonated drinks. (The products are Pepsi owned, but Varun Beverages is a contract manufacturer and distributor) (Image source: Capitalmind)Non-carbonated beveragesNon-carbonated beverages include Slice, 7Up Nimbooz, Tropicana, Sting, Gatorade, Aquafina, etc. VBL has only distribution rights for Tropicana segment (they don't make Tropicana, only distribute it) and for the rest it has manufacturing and distribution rights. VBL is setting up a plant for manufacturing of Tropicana, which will be up and running in 2019.FinancialsThe business is seasonal in nature and the peak is usually summer and bottom is winter, when sales dry up. The below chart reflects the same. And if we look at YoY, the volume have been growing. Note: VBL operates its financial year starting with Jan and ending with December. (Image source: Capitalmind)To make any geography profitable, VBL needs to sell atleast 10 million cases.Most of the revenue growth achieved is in by means of inorganic expansion. VBL has continuously added new territories (domestic and international) and simultaneously built capacity around it, rather than just eyeing distribution. (Image source: Capitalmind)The same has been reflecting in its revenue. Revenue has roughly grown at 16 percent CAGR and profit by astounding 48 percent CAGR over the last six years.And even now, most of the areas under which VBL is operational, has not been completely saturated (in terms of penetration). Also still it has South India to cover, where it doesn't have any presence.EBITDA marginsManufacturing and distribution of beverages has been a high margin business for VBL. The current EBITDA margins are at the level of 22 percent. Most of the margins come due to in house manufacturing and strategic locations of plants across India.If we can see the margins in 2013, it was at 13.70 percent. Post that VBL has acquired new territories and added new manufacturing plants. The backward integration has bought more margins in logistics and manufacturing. (Image source: Capitalmind)Tropicana for which VBL has not yet started manufacturing and only has distribution network, has lower margins compared to peers. The margins are as low as 10-12 percent. This is a significant low compared to peers.Inorganic growth comes at a costAll the acquisitions of territories and plants VBL has done is through debt. This has spiked up the debt levels of VBL. VBL started with debt of Rs 1,940 crore and at its peak of expansion it had a debt of Rs 2,654 crore.Despite this, their cash flows seem strong enough to be able to repay this very fast. (Image source: Capitalmind)Post 2017, debt levels has come down as most of the capex done in previous years have started generating cashflows. And they did not do any new capex in 2018. Currently it pays roughly 4 percent of its revenue towards finance costs.Their debt to equity is 1:1, but out of about Rs 980 crore of operational EBIDTA, they pay about Rs 211 crore towards interest – an interest coverage ratio of 4x.Trigger factorsAcquiring new territoriesVBL has very recently acquired manufacturing and distribution rights in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Both are comparatively big states, which till now were out of bounds for VBL. This will add a significant growth to its top line. And still it has some states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat to cover. These are regions which see higher temperatures in summer and have higher demand during the period.Apart from Indian sub-continent, VBL has got a foothold in Africa. a high growth market. Zambia has seen a growth 35 percent in last one year. Any new territories added over their will be an added advantage.Improving the revenue and margins in existing territoriesVBL has gone into an acquisition spree. All the new acquisitions have lower penetration with just 20 percent. In comparison, the older territories have penetration level to 30-35 percent. This gives lots of headroom for newer territories like Jharkhand for future growth.Also with in house manufacturing of Tropicana, the margins will improve significantly. Till now Tropicana has been dragging the consolidated margins. (Tropicana drags down margins by 3 percent, since they don't make the product)New innovative products with changing trendsPepsiCo has evolved with time. As the generation changes so is their drinking habits. Consumers are going towards lower calorie drinks. In line with that Pepsi has launched diet Pepsi, Pepsi Black and Sting. The recently launched products contribute nearly 2-3 percent of VBLs revenue. More new products offerings are required to drive the future growth.RisksSugar and crude prices key to marginsSugar and crude has been the major cost factor involved in manufacturing. Most of the beverages have sugar content in it (except diet Pepsi). Any increase in sugar prices directly hits margins. Crude prices are important as most of the packaging materials are derivatives of crude. Rise in crude prices will adverse effects on VBL. According to management, any increase in input cost up to 5 percent is borne by the firm. Anything above that is directly passed on to customers.Fad of carbonated drinks is waning awayGlobally, most of the developed countries are shunning beverages with high calories. And consumers are moving towards more healthy drinks rather than carbonated drinks. This trend has left beverage giants like Pepsi and Coca Cola in search of newer emerging markets like Africa, South Asia, etc. India too has placed higher taxes on sugared drinks. Smaller countries like Sri Lanka have shunned high sugar drinksVBL is facing de-growth in the by almost 20 percent this year, in Sri Lanka.The same trend has been catching up the upper urban consumers in India. This might at some stage reach a tipping point and start spiralling down. New products with changing times will keep the beverage industry going forward.Shareholding patternPromoters hold 73.56 percent stake in VBL. FPIs hold another 13.03 percent stake. Mutual funds like Reliance Growth Fund, Sundaram Value Fund and Tata Large and Midcap Fund together hold another 5.72 percent. Corporate bodies in Singapore own 3.73 percent and the tiny 3.96 percent is controlled by retail investors.

title,"Comment | Why global regulators, including RBI, are trying to reform financial benchmarks"
datetime,2019-02-22 11:17:00+00:00
description,The global financial crisis shook the very foundations of markets with financial benchmarks being one of them.
content,"Amol AgrawalAlong with the statement on monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also releases a statement on developmental and regulatory policies (SDRP), which lists changes in the banking and market regulations. In its October 2018 policy, one of the changes in SDRP was related to regulatory oversight of benchmark administrators.The central bank recently put out draft guidelines on the regulatory framework for financial benchmarks. Most people are likely to have ignored these guidelines because they are not sure what it means. However, these developments are part of global changes in financial markets which are important.So, what do we mean by financial benchmarks? Financial Benchmark India Private Ltd (FBIL) explains it as: “Financial benchmarks are indices, values or reference rates used for the purpose of pricing, settlement and valuation of financial contracts. Globally huge volumes of financial transactions are referenced to or valued using various such benchmarks.”NoneThe most important such benchmark for interest rates is the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (Libor), which was developed by the British Bankers Association (BBA) in 1986. First, the BBA polls 18 select banks on their view on the cost of funds in the inter-bank market. Second, using the trimmed mean approach, BBA rejects the highest and lowest four rates. Third, it calculates the average of the middle 10 banks to arrive at the Libor.After the 2008 global financial crisis, inquiries revealed that these select banks were colluding and underreporting Libor. This, in turn, led to overall lower interest rates in inter-bank markets, allowing the same banks to profit. This disrupted the soft infrastructure. The colluding banks were fined heavily for their misconduct, but this could not prevent erosion of trust in financial markets.In order to restore trust and design new benchmarks, regulators decided to stop using polled rates and instead use market-based interest rates on actual transactions. The mighty Libor is now going to be phased out by 2021. UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is working out a mechanism to help facilitate this transition in London’s financial markets.As a result, most countries are instituting changes to market-driven benchmarks. In 2014, the Federal Reserve convened the alternative reference rates committee (ARRC), which opted for Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as the alternative to Libor. New York Fed administers and publishes SOFR.Similarly, UK is moving to Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA); Canada is moving to the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate; Australia to Bank Bill Swap Rate (or BBSW) and the Eurosystem to Euro Short Term Rate (ESTER). Both the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) are coordinating these efforts at the global level.NoneFBIL is an outcome of this recommendation. It started with administering the Mumbai Inter Bank Offer Rate (MIBOR) rate, which was earlier managed by the National Stock Exchange, and is now computed on previous transactions and not polls, as was the case earlier.FIBIL is gradually taking up responsibilities for managing other benchmarks, such as reference rates for the foreign exchange rate, as announced in July 2018. The recent RBI guidelines noted above are to regulate these benchmark organisations, which will gradually assume an important status in financial markets.To sum up, the global financial crisis shook the very foundations of financial markets with financial benchmarks being one of them. Global authorities’, particularly central banks, are now working on alternate benchmarks, given their importance in running financial markets.Indian policymakers have done well to show alacrity to these ongoing global developments and instituting changes looking at both, domestic context and global practices. This is welcome and should be followed in other domains of economic policy as well."

title,Cross-border financial planning: Six tips to get it right
datetime,2019-02-20 18:02:00+00:00
description,The first thing to be checked is if a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement exists between India and their country of residence.
content,"Lovaii NavlakhiFinancial planning is slowly getting to be as common place as a commodity, though there are subtle underlying complexities. These could be factors like life expectancy, return expectations and rate of inflation, to name a few. For a non-resident Indian (NRI), financial planning becomes even more complex as the variables increase manifold.Apart from additional financial aspects that need to be considered, there are softer aspects which need to be paid attention to. Here’s a glimpse of some of theirs as well as our experiences.Goals spread across countriesOne set of people is those who have worked for a while in India, and then worked overseas. If they are entrepreneurs, or in a consultancy role, they want to be able to straddle India and their current home to get the best of both worlds, in terms of work as well as a more salubrious climate. What we need to consider is the allocation of time between the two countries, the differing rates of inflation and the impact of currency depreciation. Further aspects that we have faced is:- What happens to the property they are staying in? Will they be able to rent it out during the time it is vacant – is the travel to India in smaller time slots or at a stretch?- Where will they stay while they are in India? Is there an emotional connect with “home”?- Will they be able to adjust to living in India if they have lived abroad for long? We have faced a situation where despite a strong commercial interest in India, a client could not reconcile with the infrastructure issues in India, and hence wanted to have an option to go back.- Are they able to predict the expenses that might be required in India to maintain their lifestyle? We have had extremes of both under-estimation and over-estimation of Indian expenses, as either big “comfort” expenses are missed out, or excessive buffers are created.- What happens if an opportunity comes along to work in a third country? Even though this may be a temporary opportunity, currency issues may play a big role in tweaking their financial plan.Assets spread across countriesThe first issue that comes up as absentee landlords is the need to get property management services in place. There is a strong need to have competent, local financial advisors and tax consultants in countries where assets are held; as we do know, ignorance of the law is no excuse. We have faced situations where our clients have got wrong advice because the tax consultant has never dealt with cross-border issues and may be unaware of Indian tax laws.Inheritance issuesInvestors must plan for both receipt and transfer of inheritance. Awareness of how to reduce the impact of “death taxes” during their lifetime; and creating appropriate structures could help in substantially reducing the government share in their estate. It is suggested that you have a will registered locally for each of the countries where you own assets, with a cross reference made in each will of the other. Execution of such wills is much easier than with one master will.TaxationThe first thing to be checked is if a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) exists between India and their country of residence. This allows for claiming tax credits for taxes paid in the other country while filing of your tax returns and hence improving the liquidity by not paying excess taxes in both countries.For many US “tax persons” investing in India the advantage of the tax-free nature of the NRE (non-resident external) fixed deposit is nullified as global income is subject to tax in the US. In another situation, Indian residents can invest to save capital gains tax in India, but this benefit is not available to NRIs residing in UK where you get credit for taxes paid and not for taxes saved.Insurance coversNoneNoneA complete scan of the investment products available in different countries requires working with multiple advisors so that each can bring his local expertise to the fore. The focus has to be on the financial goals, and to the extent possible, local goals ought to be met locally to avoid any issue of currency fluctuation.You can read more here on, Exchange rate fluctuations: How to overcome the palpitations?Financial planning is indeed the bedrock on which your dreams and aspirations are achieved. Find the right expertise so that you do not miss these aspects as a global citizen."

The platform will then provide the details of all such sellers to the trademark owner. If the trademark owner notifies the marketplace for removal of a particular listing being counterfeit, the marketplace must be required to remove it within 12 hours,” the letter states.“In case a formal consumer complaint is received about a product being fake, the same shall be conveyed within 12 hours to the trademark owners registered with the platform,” it adds.Local Circles had also stated last year that one out of every five products sold on e-commerce platforms are fake.

content,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met on Friday with China's President Xi Jinping and bagged a USD 10 billion oil deal, pressing on with his diplomatic charm offensive in Asia following a global outcry over the Khashoggi killing.Mohammed arrived in Beijing on Thursday following visits to Pakistan and India, showing the world that his country still has allies after the grisly murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.He met with Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng earlier on Friday.""Is the crown prince's tour symbolic of Saudi Arabia's pivot to the East? Yes,"" Najah al-Otaibi, a senior analyst at the pro-Saudi think-tank Arabia Foundation, told AFP.""Riyadh wants to strengthen alliances in Asia -- especially now with the continuing fallout with the United States over Khashoggi's murder and other issues and attempts by the EU to put Riyadh on a black list over money laundering allegations,"" she said.Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the prince, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October, a murder that tarnished the image of the kingdom and of the crown prince in particular.Riyadh initially denied the murder, then gave several conflicting accounts of Khashoggi's death, and now claims he was killed in an unauthorised operation that did not involve Mohammed.The murder sparked global indignation, with US lawmakers pushing for the United States to distance itself from the crown prince, but the White House has maintained close relations with Riyadh, a major Middle East ally.Separately, the European Commission wants to add Saudi Arabia to a money-laundering blacklist of governments that do too little to thwart the financing of terrorism and organised crime.But China is looking to strengthen its economic ties with the kingdom, as Beijing pursues its ambitious Belt and Road trade infrastructure initiative, while Riyadh rolls out ""Saudi Vision 2030"" -- the crown prince's major programme to diversify the national economy away from oil.During their meeting, Han suggested that the two countries deepen partnerships in energy, infrastructure construction, finance, and high-tech.Riyadh's national oil giant Saudi Aramco said it had signed an agreement to form a Saudi-Chinese joint venture -- worth more than USD 10 billion -- to develop a refining and petrochemical complex in northeastern Liaoning province.The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority also announced the signing of 35 non-binding memorandums of understanding, including deals related to energy, mining, transportation and e-commerce.China is Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner.""As the kingdom diversifies its non-oil economy, it needs a variety of other investors with technical expertise, including the Chinese,"" Otaibi said.National security is also a potential area of cooperation between the Gulf state and China.The two countries should boost partnerships in counterterrorism and law enforcement, and exchange experience on combating extremism, Han said in his meeting with Mohammed, according to Xinhua's report.The Saudis said it ""firmly supported"" Beijing's efforts to keep the country secure, and opposed ""interference by external forces in China's internal affairs"", said Xinhua, paraphrasing remarks from the crown prince.Mohammed's remarks came as Riyadh has remained silent over China's treatment of Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in the far-west region of Xinjiang."

title,BJP's Look East policy | Northeast: Saffron party's push for Citizenship Bill may upset leads in the region
datetime,2019-02-22 16:58:00+00:00
description,This is the final instalment of a three-part series on how the BJP looks to offset losses in the North with gains in the East
content,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to make electoral gains in the eastern, southern and Northeastern regions of the country in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.For the BJP, these gains would help offset some of the losses it is expected to face in the ‘Hindi heartland’ states.In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the Narendra Modi-led party swept through the Hindi-speaking belt.Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Chandigarh and the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi have a total of 226 parliamentary seats. The BJP won 191 of these seats in the previous parliamentary election. Its partners from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 11 seats there.In December 2018, Congress was able to wrest Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan from the BJP in one-on-one contests in the assembly elections largely banking local anti-incumbency and agrarian distress.The saffron party is now facing similar anti-incumbency in many other northern states, leading observers to believe that it is likely to face substantial losses. Experts also highlight that the lack of a ‘Modi wave’ that had swelled BJP’s vote share in 2014.NoneOpinion polls concur with these observations. Multiple polls have predicted BJP facing heavy losses in the Hindi-speaking belt.The Samajwadi Party (SP)-Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance could cut down BJP’s tally to half in Uttar Pradesh alone, the surveys show.The East and Northeast has been untapped regions for the BJP as far as parliamentary constituencies are concerned. So, it is here that the saffron party is desperate to make gains.The region, comprising Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura, has a total of 88 seats. The BJP had won just 11 of these Lok Sabha seats in 2014.The BJP has traditionally been a no-player in the Northeast. After Independence, many of the states in the region had Congress-led governments. Subsequently, regional parties sprang banking on regional identities and local issues.The BJP has historically had negligible support in the Northeast. The BJP did not have an organisation in the region as it has in many of India’s states. It relied on regional parties for support.In fact, in the 2014 Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh, BJP won only 11 out of the 42 seats it contested in the 60-member assembly. With 42 seats, Congress registered a comfortable win. In Sikkim, it failed to win a single seat in the 2014 Assembly polls just like the Congress.None‘The sun rises in the east’However, in 2016, the BJP launched a massive campaign in Assam banking on the three-term anti-incumbency against Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi. The saffron party managed to register a historic victory along with its allies.It was also able to form a government in Arunachal Pradesh after many Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) there defected from the Congress.With the help of allies, it was able to oust yet another three-term chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh.In the first half of 2018, the party formed governments in Meghalaya and Nagaland along with its allies and single-handedly displaced Manik Sarkar-led Left government in Tripura. Left had held power in the state since 1993.In December 2018, BJP’s dream of “Congress-mukt Northeast” was realised when the MNF trumped Congress in Mizoram.The party structure has swelled rapidly since in most of these states.BJP has been gaining ground in the Northeast states in both parliamentary and assembly elections. The saffron party has not gained at the cost of the regional parties, but also the Congress which is the other national party there.NoneIn the same period, BJP’s average vote share ballooned from under 4 percent to above 23 percent.The report also suggests that from an average seat share of 1.5 seats in six state elections between 2009 and 2014, BJP’s average tally jumped to 23.5 seats there.Mergers and acquisitions To enter the Northeast, BJP deployed the ‘mergers and acquisition’ strategy. Since 2014, the saffron party has actively formed alliances in the region. The efforts culminated in formation of the Northeast Democratic Alliance (NEDA) in 2016.NEDA’s key members are the Bodoland People's Front (BPP), Ganashakti Party, Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT), Manipur Democratic People's Front (MDPF), Manipur Peoples Party (MPP), Mizo National Front (MNF), Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), National People's Party (NPP) and Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF).Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) was part of the alliance till January 2019 while People's Party of Arunachal (PPA) was subsumed by BJP in December 2016.NoneHowever, some of these parties have at times fought local and assembly elections separately. For example, the MNF and the BJP contested the 2018 Mizoram Assembly elections separately.The eight states have a total of 25 seats. With all of Northeast being governed by the BJP or its allies, the saffron party is hoping to win a significant number.Assam, with a total of 14 seats, is at the heart of BJP’s Northeast strategy. Besides winning seven seats in 2014, the party had finished second in five constituencies (Karimganj, Silchar, Autonomous District, Barpeta and Kaliabor). Interestingly, the margin of loss was less than 10 percent in four of these constituencies.In Arunachal Pradesh, BJP won one seat and lost the other with a margin of less than 5 percent.NoneThe sharp drop in BJP’s favourability there may have been caused by the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. The contentious issue, which witnessed widespread protests in recent months, has visibly swung the mood in the Northeast.Under fear that voters might desert them because of their proximity to the BJP, many partners are threatening to quit the NDA.The Citizenship conundrumBJP has been pushing for The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill that seeks to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal immigrants (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) eligible for Indian citizenship.The move witnessed severe opposition in the region, especially in Assam.NoneH Srikanth, professor of political science at the North-Eastern Hill University, told Moneycontrol: “The legal and illegal migration that took place during colonial and post-colonial periods have generated so much of fear psychosis among the local inhabitants (in the region), who call themselves indigenous people or the natives, that they spontaneously unite to protect what they consider to be their regional and native interests.”As a result, there is a movement against the Bill being led by civil society organisations, students and native intellectuals.None Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) member stop a train during a protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill near Kamakhya Junction railway station, in Guwahati, Assam. (Image: PTI)Modi reiterated that BJP was committed to implement the 36-year old Assam Accord.NoneNone“No regional party, irrespective of whether they support BJP or Congress at the national level, can dare to take a stand against the wishes of the local communities. As is evident, the AGP and the NCP came out openly against the Citizenship Bill,” Srikanth said.NoneWhile the bill was under consideration in the Upper House, Srikanth said, “As such, if the Rajya Sabha passes the Bill, the Northeastern states may experience Assam Agitation-like situation in the entire region.”Some of the local BJP leaders in the Northeast states had taken a stand against the bill fearing desertions. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, belonging to the BJP, has come under pressure to push his party to withdraw the bill.Yet, the BJP has not backed down on the bill. In fact, BJP national president Amit Shah has said they would re-introduce the bill if they retain power. Some experts believe that the Bill’s pros for the BJP in West Bengal and pockets of Northeast outweigh the cons.“The Citizenship Bill is an integral part of BJP’s overall agenda to turn India into Hindustan. They expect the Bill to get support across the country, although they know they would meet resistance in the Northeastern states,” Srikanth said.None“Even here, the BJP leaders are trying to convince the locals in Assam that it helps to increase the Hindu population and helps in reducing the percentage of Bengali Muslims, thus protecting the locals against the so called Bangladeshis,” Srikanth added.NoneAsked why the BJP had pushed for the bill even as it stared at losses in the Northeast, Partha Das, psephologist and analyst at political consultancy Chanakyya, told Moneycontrol that the move was driven by ideology.“There seems to be no electoral strategy behind this. This is only ideological just like the Ram Mandir issue,” Das said.Srikanth said while the resistance may not make “much of difference to BJP, as the total number of Lok Sabha seats from the Northeast are just 25, in the event of no national party gaining majority, the seats from the Northeast do matter”.Not all losses, some gainsAccording to Srikanth, while the sentiments against the Bill are strong among Assamese and the tribals, “there is support for the Bill among the Hindu Bengalis who are in substantial numbers in Tripura and in Assam’s Barak valley region”.This may help BJP in fetching some seats in Tripura and in the Hindu Bengali-dominated areas of Assam such as the Barak Valley, “where many Bengali families did not find their names cleared in the NRC (National Register of Citizens) report,” Srikanth suggested."

title,Apex Legends: All you need to know before jumping onto the battlefield
datetime,2019-02-22 13:39:00+00:00
description,Everything you need to know before jumping onto a battlefield in Apex Legends.
content,"EA's free-to-play battle royale game Apex Legends has been gaining considerable steam over the past couple of weeks, already hitting over 25 million players. Apex Legends does stand out from games like PUBG and Fortnite and jumping into the game can be difficult at first. While it may not take you much time to understand the fundamentals of the game, even a little time can cost your team a victory. So, here’s a little first-timers guide detailing everything you need to keep in mind while jumping into a game.Each Legend in the game has different abilities; you might want to take a bit of time to read through a Legend’s abilities before diving into combat. Don’t stop at one Legend; you should get a gist of the skills of at least 3 Legends before hitting that ‘Ready’ button. Since Apex Legends is a 3-man team-based battle royale, you could get drafted last to pick a Legend.Players are launched into the game in teams of three. Each side has a Jumpmaster who can control the entire team’s landing location. Although you can separate from the team and choose the area you want to land in, it isn’t advisable, as players who usually break from their teams are easily picked off. If you’re assigned as the Jumpmaster and don’t know where to land, simply relinquish control by holding down on ‘Left Control’.Once you land, head to the nearest supply bin or building to gather ammunition and armour. Do not attempt to fight an enemy using melee attacks with your fist, as you could end up hurt if an enemy finds a weapon, while you’re going on an unarmed chase.Lastly, when you die during a game-in-progress, don’t immediately leave the game. As teammates will still be able to revive you within a short 90-second window. You can also revive a teammate by picking up their tag using ‘E’. Once you’ve got the tag, head to the nearest Respawn Beacon (Indicated as green icons on minimap), interact with the beacon and your ally will fly back on a dropship. You might want to hold back while an ally drops as revived allies drop unarmed, which could make them easy targets."

title,How to use Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator for profitable trading
datetime,2019-02-23 08:50:00+00:00
description,MFI above 80 is considered overbought condition and below 20 oversold condition. Pattern analysis can be combined with MFI to increase signal robustness.
content,"Shabbir KayyumiThe Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that usages both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure on a financial instrument. It is created by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack. This indicator is also known as volume-weighted RSIWhat is a ‘Money Flow Index (MFI)?The Money Flow Index is a rather unique indicator that combines momentum and volume with an RSI formula. MFI generally favors the bulls when the indicator is above 50 and the bears when below 50.MFI above 80 is considered overbought condition and below 20 oversold condition. Pattern analysis can be combined with MFI to increase signal robustness.NoneConstruction of MFI IndicatorThe MFI is calculated by accumulating positive and negative Money Flow values (see Money Flow), then creating a Money Ratio. The Money Ratio is then normalized into the MFI oscillator form.NoneWorking of MFI IndicatorA divergence between the indicator and price is very important. There are two types of divergences positive divergence & negative divergence; both are very useful for trading purpose. While positive divergence indicates opportunity to Buy, negative divergence indicates opportunity to sell.None• Just like the RSI, the value of the MFI ranges between 0 and 100, and uses a default setting of 14 periods for its calculation. The Money Flow Index has a high correlation with the RSI, but still differs to some extent as it takes into account the trading volume of the instrument.NoneTrading Technique:Failure Swings Trading with MFIApart from regular oscillator trading technique, failure swings are another occurrence which can lead to a price reversal. Failure swings are completely independent of price and rely solely on MFI. Failure swings consist of four “steps” and are considered to be either Bullish (buying opportunity) or Bearish (selling opportunity).Buying with MFI4. A MFI break out above its previous high is a good buy signal.NoneSelling with MFI4. MFI drops lower than its previous low is a signal to short sell or profit booking.Using MFI in conjunction with other technical indicators helps in maximizing odds of success.The author is Head - Technical & Derivative Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors."

content,"Dubai-based luxury hotel chain owner Jumeirah Group is still scouting opportunities to enter India. It is one of the few global hospitality chains that are yet to hoist their flag in the country.The operator of Burj Al Arab is keen to have a property in either Mumbai, Delhi or at resort locations such as Goa and Kerala; however, it has not yet found the ‘right partner’. The company has an asset-light model of operation where it takes properties on a management contract.The means that Jumeirah has aborted its plans to open its first property in Mumbai in the business district of Lower Parel. The group had signed a contract in 2012 for managing a luxury property that was earlier set to open this year.Speaking to Moneycontrol Shaf Butt, Regional Director of Marketing, Middle East and Asia Pacific said, “There is nothing definite at the moment. Just like any other key city we are exploring opportunities. Our development team has been on an expansion journey where we are looking to have 50 hotels in 5-10 years. The team is surely looking at India too.”Jumeirah has 24 operational properties across the United Arab Emirates, China, South Asia, UK and Germany. In addition, there are six properties under development. The brand competes in the ultra-luxury segment against brands such as Four Seasons, and Mandarin Oriental to name a few.“Unfortunately, it does take time. A lot of our hotels are managed hotels. We have to not just find the right location but find the right owners as well to work with and this takes time. India has not been difficult than others it is just taking a bit of time. India is a major source market for Jumeirah and we are aware that we need to have a property here,” added Butt.After a slowdown, the hospitality market has picked pace swiftly since the start of the current financial year. Across market segments, occupancy of 65 percent along with an average room rate of Rs 5,846 was recorded in 2018 according to STR Howarth.Within this, the luxury segment has seen demand growing by 5 percent whereas supply grew by 3.2 percent. Demand in the upper upscale segment grew by 4.3 percent while supply grew by 2.8 percent, according to STR Howarth. This strong mismatch in demand and supply has led to a sharp spike in room rates."

title,"Not releasing Bollywood films in Pakistan won't affect Indian film industry, say experts"

description,Bollywood trade analyst Taran Adarsh says Indian films have great viewership in Pakistan but the collection from the country does not contribute much to the worldwide box office numbers of Hindi films.
content,"The decision of Indian film fraternity to not release their movies in Pakistan following Pulwama attack will have a fleeting effect on the box office collections, believe experts. In the wake of the February 14 terror attack, which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF jawans, makers of films such as ""Total Dhamaal"", ""Luka Chuppi"", ""Arjun Patiala"", ""Notebook"" and ""Kabir Singh"" have announced not to screen the movies in the neighbouring country.Bollywood trade analyst Taran Adarsh says Indian films have great viewership in Pakistan but the collection from the country does not contribute much to the worldwide box office numbers of Hindi films.He, however, believes it would be detrimental to the earnings of distributors in Pakistan.""There are about 150 screens in Pakistan. Like us, they also love Hindi movies. They make very few films. Also, you cannot show Hollywood films round-the-clock. Indian films are a big addiction... It is going to be tough for them as it is a small market for us,"" Adarsh told PTI.Echoing Adarsh's views, city-based film exhibitor Akshay Rathi says the exhibition sector of Pakistan will be more affected by the decision.""The impact of Indian films not releasing in Pakistan will be massive on exhibition sector there, but it will be minuscule for Indian producers. Lots of consumption of Indian films happens through piracy and the kind of collection that comes out of Pakistan is very less as compared to other territories,"" he adds.According to Rathi, on an average, Hindi films do a business of about Rs 4-7 crores in Pakistan.The biggest hit from Bollywood in Pakistan is Salman Khan's 2016 Eid blockbuster ""Sultan"", amassing Rs 37 crore. Salman's 2015 cross-border drama ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" minted Rs 23 crore in the country.Aamir Khan-starrers ""Dhoom 3"" and ""PK"" earned Rs 25 crore and Rs 22 crore respectively, while Shah Rukh Khan's ""Fan"" grossed Rs 6.5 crore.Sanjay Leela Bhansali's ""Bajirao Mastani"" collected Rs 9 crore and ""Race 2"", featuring Saif Ali Khan, did a business of Rs 4.93 crore.Rahul Kadbet, Vice President, Programming at Carnival Cinemas, says, Pakistan contributes around ""four to six"" percent to the total collection of Indian films.""The losses can be amortized from other avenues like exploiting new media platforms. A blockbuster Indian film hardly grosses four to six percent of Indian box office in Pakistan and for a regular film, it is even less.""""This is actually a big loss for them because their industry depends up to 70 percent on Bollywood and Hollywood content,"" Kadbet adds.Following the blanket ban on Pakistani artistes, singer Atif Aslam's song from upcoming film ""Notebook"", produced by Salman, has been taken down. The track will now be re-recorded.Director of the film, Nitin Kakkar says the attack was unfortunate and the team is already searching for a new voice.""There's only one song of Atif in the film and we will have to redo it. We all are Indians and it is unfortunate whatever has happened. But the show must go on as they say,"" Nitin said when asked about who would be replacing Atif.Pakistani actor-musician Nouman Javaid, who got a break in Bollywood with Mahesh Bhatt's production ""Jashnn"", believes ban on artistes in both India and Pakistan is not a solution.""No artiste from any part of the world will support or indulge in any kind of harm or damage done to anyone. Musicians talk about love and peace. We need to put this ongoing cold war between India and Pakistan to rest. It is unjust and uncalled for. The two countries need to come together for peace. We cannot afford war,"" he says.Condemning the Pulwama attack, Nouman says both the countries need to come together to fight terrorism.""We condemn it. The normal and beautiful Pakistani feels bad whenever there is something like this happens anywhere in the world. We have been a victim of a lot of bomb blasts. Both the nations need to come together to resolve the issue of terrorism. This needs to be sorted out. War is evil. We don't want it,"" he says.Pakistani filmmaker Sohail Khan, however, believes Indian film industry will suffer losses as the country contributes a good share to the worldwide collections of Bollywood films.""The Indian film industry makes a lot of money by screening movies in Pakistan. My idea is they make Rs 700-800 billion annually as over 100 films are exported and shown in Pakistan. So it is a big business for them and they will also lose money by this decision,"" Khan told PTI.""I think there will be a short term impact on film and cinema business here due to this decision but in the long term it would be good that Indian films are not shown in Pakistan,"" he adds.The director says no collective decision has been taken by Indian film associations on the future of releasing films in Pakistan.""Only a few individuals have announced that they will not screen films in Pakistan. I have not seen any such collective decision by any association. I think it will not be very effective as there are people in India who would not like to lose market in Pakistan.""Legally, Indian films are still banned in Pakistan and they are shown when a No- Objection Certificate is issued by authorities,"" he says."

title,Does interest rate increase make EPF an attractive investment option?
datetime,2019-02-22 16:36:00+00:00
description,Investments in employees provident fund earn a higher rate of interest than bank fixed deposits and also taxfree interest. 
content,"NoneNone“The taxfree nature of returns on EPF, makes it an attractive option for individuals looking to save for their retirement over the long term,” said Vishal Dhawan, Founder and Chief Financial Planner of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. Conservative investors looking to invest in fixed income option with a sovereign guarantee for the long term can also look at a voluntary contribution to EPF.An employee contributes 12 percent of his basic salary and dearness allowance every month to EPF. The maximum contribution allowed is up to 100 percent of the basic salary and dearness allowance.In its monetary policy earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of India cut the repo rate by 25 basis points indicating interest rates in the economy are on their way down. However, the EPFO choose to hike the interest rates by 10 basis points. “This dichotomy won’t last for a long period of time,” Dhawan said. Individuals should take note of the same while contributing to EPF, he said.The EPF interest rate is reviewed every year and is applicable to the accumulated corpus as well as contributions in that year.Individuals nearing their superannuation/retirement age (with two to three years left to retirement) can also consider aggressively investing in EPF. Such individuals can opt for a voluntary contribution to EPF by writing to their employers to that effect. Such money can earn taxfree interest until they retire and help boost their retirement corpus. This will help them earn more on investments compared to bank fixed deposits that offer interest rates of 7-8 percent for a similar tenure and are taxable at the marginal rate of tax."

In the NSEL case, the exchange was found to have not maintained sufficient underlying stock on trades it allowed, even as brokers sold lucrative contracts to investors. In 2013, the exchange defaulted on payments worth Rs 5,600 crore.In an order uploaded on its website on February 22, SEBI said that the brokers had a close association with NSEL and allowed themselves to “become a channel”.“Thus… the noticee is not a fit and proper person to be granted registration/to operate as a commodity derivatives broker”.SEBI said clients of the commodity broking firms to withdraw or transfer their securities held with the brokers within 45 days without any additional cost.Some of the other leading brokers who are being probed in the NSEL case are Anand Rathi Commodities, Philip Commodities and Geofin Commodities.Over the past few years, however, several brokers, including Motilal Oswal and IIFL have moved their commodity broking arm under the same unit that operates stock broking under SEBI’s unified licence regime.While SEBI’s 'not fit and proper' status applies to the commodity arms, it is unclear in terms of what it would mean for the unified broking business of the firms.IIFL has clarified that its commodity broking firm, India Infoline Commodities (IICL), does not have any outstanding dues to any clients, nor does not it have any proprietary position."

description,None
content,"NoneHighlightsNoneNoneWhile further developments need to be closely monitored, we try to decipher what this announcement could mean for minority shareholders of the company. In the process, we also highlight the key points which investor needs to know about the company.RNAM, the first AMC to list, made its debut on bourses in November 2017 around Rs 295 per share, a premium of 17 percent over its issue price of Rs 252.NoneNoneIts equity assets saw an 8 percent year-on year (YoY) growth to Rs 89,794 crore as at December-end. As a consequence, the share of equity assets increased to 38 percent of average quarterly AUM, an improvement of 400 basis points (100 bps=1 percentage point) as compared to the same period last year. As fee on equity assets is much higher compared to other asset classes, the change in asset mix in favour of equity assets indicates the management’s focus on profitable growth.NoneRNAM is also one of the largest exchange traded fund (ETF) players with around 17 percent market share (in terms of quarterly average AUM). Including ETFs, equity assets stood at Rs 1,02,734 crore as at December-end, rising 12 percent year-on-year (YoY).Also read: 3 Point Analysis | Reliance intends to exit MF businessIt enjoys monthly inflows of Rs 842 crore through systematic investment plan (SIP), which provides better visibility of AUM growth since SIP inflows are generally for the long term and tends to be relatively sticky.Despite not having a captive bank distribution channel, RNAM is ahead of industry in sourcing assets from beyond top 30 cities, referred as B30 locations. These locations contributed 18 percent of RNAM’s average AUM, better compared to industry’s B30 AUM at 15 percent.NoneNoneNoneEven though Nippon Life is an equal partner with 42.88 percent stake in the AMC, Reliance ADAG’s stake has been a key overhang for the stock. Hence, Reliance ADAG group’s decision to reduce its stake in the business will help assuage investor concerns.NoneIt is worth noting that the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI)  issue of capital and disclosure requirements (ICDR) requires promoters’ contribution to be locked in for three-years following an initial public offer (IPO). Accordingly, Reliance Capital and Nippon’s 10 percent stake each are locked-in for a period of three-years from the date of allotment, which was around August 2017. Hence, it is unlikely that Reliance Capital will fully exit its AMC business.Even a part exit of Reliance Capital will trigger an open offer to minority equity shareholders, who hold around 14 percent equity in the AMC. SEBI’s Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover (SAST) regulations stipulate making a mandatory open offer in the event of any substantial change in shareholding or change in control of the company.While the deal will be termed as promoters inter se transfer, regulations say that if a party already holds at least a quarter of the target's voting rights (in this case Nippon Life holds 42 percent in AMC), a mandatory open offer will be triggered if that party acquires more than five percent of the target's voting rights in any financial year.NoneAt the current market capitalisation of Rs 12,500 crore, RNAM is trading at 5.3 percent the average MF AUM of Rs 2,36,300 crore as at December-end. Its total AUM is higher around Rs 4,14,400 crore because of pension assets managed. Since the management fees on pension assets is minuscule, we don’t include these assets while valuing the company. The stock is currently trading at 20 times FY20 estimated earnings.On a relative basis, valuation are very compelling. RNAM’s stock is trading at a discount of more than 40 percent to HDFC AMC’s valuation. The most common push back to this kind of valuation comparison is that HDFC AMC is in a league of its own and commands a premium valuation for its brand and superior return ratio, with a 40 percent return on equity (RoE). While rightful discount to HDFC AMC is justified, RNAM is trading at a significant discount, which we think is unwarranted and should narrow down. Given the reasonable valuations, the stock could further re-rate, if the deal goes through.NoneNone"

content,"Popular mobile wallets such as Paytm and Mobikwik now offer ways to invest in direct mutual fund schemes through their apps without any charges. With over 300 million registered customers using Paytm and more than 107 million registered customers using Mobikwik, mutual funds would get a booster dose in penetrating the hinterlands in India.Users of these mobile wallets will now be able to pick and choose a mutual fund of their choice on their respective platforms and get to invest in direct mutual fund schemes on tap of the fingers through apps.Paytm launched mutual fund investment services through a separate app called Paytm Money in September 2018. According to the company reports, since its launch, Paytm Money has now crossed one million users who invest in direct mutual fund scheme using their platform.Now with recent developments, Paytm Payments Bank users would be able to make their account as the primary bank account on Paytm Money, and it will be the default choice for investment and redemption of mutual fund investments. Earlier the purchases were allowed through the wallets but the redemption could only be settled back in the investor’s bank account, which was a cumbersome process.However, Paytm Payment Bank account is not mandatory to invest in mutual funds via Paytm Wallet. You can continue to invest in mutual funds by setting up auto pay (one-time bank mandate) on Paytm Money app to enable one-click investments from your primary bank account. Alternatively, you can invest using Unified Payments Interface (UPI), net banking and debit card of your verified bank account.Following Paytm’s footsteps, in October 2018 Mobikwik acquired wealth management platform Clearfunds to enter into the wealth management business. Through this acquisition, the MobiKwik platform allowed its customers to start investing in direct mutual funds seamlessly from the app.There seems a rat race to acquire new investors and make them habitual to savings and investing in mutual funds using their mobile wallets. The ease of investing is convenient, but are investors equipped to ascertain their risk profile and invest in the right mutual fund scheme?Moneycontrol asks four experts:Stance: BoonThe biggest challenge for the mutual fund industry today is adoption and penetration. Out of the total population of 130 crore, we today have only approximately four crore mutual fund folios, which when de-duplicated (one person having multiple investment folios), falls more than 50 percent.Traditionally, mutual fund investments can only be made from bank accounts. Learning from what wallets did to the payment industry in terms of penetration and adoption, SEBI allowed mutual funds to be purchased via wallets. However, we’re yet to see the benefits play out. And the reasons lie embedded in the SEBI’s circular itself.According to the SEBI’s circular dated May 8, 2017, individuals could use mobile wallets to invest in mutual funds provided that the money is loaded into the wallet, from a bank account (a mobile wallet otherwise can be loaded through cash, credit cards, cashback as well).Now, although this sounds simple, the challenge came in the form of mechanisms for identifying the source of money. No wallet company had anything in place to identify the colour of money as it was not only an arduous task but it didn’t seem to be that important.These wallets are convenient to use and also give a very promising outlook for market penetration and adoption. And can be a game changer for enabling the new generation of digitally savvy users to start saving and investing, with professionally managed and efficient mutual fund products. But that can only happen if the regulations are eased.It doesn’t matter if your mobile wallet is linked to the same company’s payment bank or not. None of the wallet companies today have an infrastructure to identify the source of the money (it has to be from your bank account) so no, you cannot subscribe to mutual funds.Stance: BoonAnything that motivates and sustains a regular investing habit is beneficial to an investor. Be it new varieties of systematic investment plan (SIP) or new methods of making the investment, if a new idea makes it more convenient or profitable for an investor, it’s definitely a good idea.Wallets have found great favour among millennials in the country as the favourite way of moving money around. Mutual fund industry is constantly looking to see how it can tap the millennial market to get them going on the investment habit early in their life. Also, the industry needs to keep with the changing habits of its target market. So, enabling investments through wallets is simply a matter of industry going towards where the money is when it comes to next-generation investors.For the young investors, this makes it easy and convenient to get started with investments and they can track it easily with all their other expenses and outflows. One thing to be cautious, however, is the ease of conducting a transaction should not be combined with ease of building a portfolio itself. If young investors can do sufficient groundwork to understand the investment process and instruments better before they transact, it will truly yield the ultimate benefits of investing for them.Stance: BaneUsing mobile wallets to invest in mutual fund schemes is not recommended to investors. Primarily for the reason that mutual fund schemes have undergone several changes with recategorisation and rationalisation. Even evolved investors face difficulty in understanding changes made by the asset management companies. So, for new investors, it will be a challenge to select the right scheme from mobile wallets as per their risk appetite and goals.Second, mobile wallets have picked up pace among consumers to book movie or travelling tickets, pay utility bills, etc., which is fine. But using mobile wallets for making mutual fund investments is a little bit of delicate affair. I would not advise the investors to put their money for investment in mutual funds through mobile wallets as it’s still not investor friendly in terms of adaptability. Plus, on wallets, there is no one to advise the investors.On investments done through mobile wallets, there might not be clarity on the process, reporting and monitoring of the investment portfolios. Investors should prefer investment platforms with more simplicity and structured process.For investors, it’s always better to invest under the guidance and with the help of some financial expert who monitors the portfolio and explains them the pros and drawbacks of invested schemes on regular basis. It is better to invest directly with the fund house or through IFAs on recommended schemes instead of mobile wallets. Because there is monitoring, there is a responsibility on a financial advisor for recommending schemes that perform.Also, there is a comfort level on advice between an investor and advisor, which is missing while investing through mobile wallets on your own.Stance: NeutralMillennials who are hooked to mobile phones and prefer Ola, Swiggy, BookMyShow, etc. will opt mobile wallets for investing into mutual funds either with expectations of higher returns or due to sheer convenience of investing.Also, retail investors who have burned fingers in the past due to wrong advice or inadequate handholding of some agents, bankers and distributors, may buy from mobile wallets due to transparency and feeling of being in control.But, investors through mobile wallets are likely to redeem investments quickly or stop SIPs during the volatile markets since they might lack knowledge of mutual fund products and investment discipline. In future, investor experience of investing through mobile wallets will define the success of this model, not just the cost and convenience factor.As investors evolve, they will prefer to work with a human financial advisor when they find a trustworthy advisor, easily accessible and cost-efficient. So, many of these young investors will prefer to seek offline consultation and then invest in mutual funds."

description,Omega-3 fatty acid is crucial for brain and heart health and Indian diet does not provide enough of it
content,"Moneycontrol News Given the rise in the concept of healthy living and diet among millennials, hybrid food is gaining immense significance. However, not many organic or vitamin-infused food items come cheap.To break this concept, Delhi-based Treue Food Trading is working on the production of Omega-3 eggs in India, which will come at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives such as fish or flaxseed.Omega-3 fatty acid is crucial for brain and heart health and Indian diet does not provide enough of it.Indian consumers are mostly not aware of the level of Omega-3 required in their bodies.Recognising this gap, Chirag Sabunani and Vikas Gupta are working to solve this need sustainably and affordably.""This is a small segment premium market and we are looking to make Omega-3 eggs now become the basic standard for those who can afford it,"" said Vikas Gupta, co-founder of Treue.""Eggs are not just an affordable form of nutrition, but are also easily accessible to the majority of our people. In Mumbai alone, two crore eggs are sold every day, an indicative number illustrating that eggs are the perfect way for us to get more Omega-3 into everyone’s diet,"" said Gupta.The cost of a regular egg is Rs 4-5 while Omega 3 eggs come at an added cost of less than Rs 1 per unit.The duo is working with scientist Mahabaleshwar Hegde to produce these eggs.The company is currently able to guarantee 250 mg of Omega 3 per egg. It does so by feeding hens poultry feed made from a special variety of flaxseed.Hegde’s work on flaxseed and supporting flax farmers has also been recognised by the Indian government and the World Bank.""With the technology now in place, our goal is to establish Omega-3 enriched eggs as the new basic standard that families enjoy with their loved ones,"" said Sabunani.The company claims that unlike a normal egg, the Omega-3 egg is very healthy as the bird feed completely transforms its fat into healthy fat by increasing Omega-3 and Vitamin E (double than that of a normal egg) and decreasing cholesterol, Omega-6 and saturated fat.However according to nutritionists while these eggs are healthier than regular eggs, they have a lesser amount of Omega 3 than a portion of fish.""The kind of Omega 3 they contain is mainly DHA and ALA. Out of which DHA is great for brain tissues but ALA is not by itself Omega 3. It has to get converted into Omega 3 in the body. Whereas the Omega 3 that you get from the fish like Salmon are directly DHA plus EPA,"" said leading nutritionist Anjali Mukerjee.She also said that health-conscious people are in the habit of consuming egg whites. However, the Omega 3 part of the egg resides in the yolk."

content,"More than 10 days after a section of workers stopped reporting to duty at Royal Enfield’s factory near Chennai, the worker’s union decided to voluntarily end their strike on February 23.This move comes after the company’s management, which termed the strike illegal, has claimed to have given transfer orders to five more workers and a dismissal order to more than 40 trainees.A letter distributed by Royal Enfield welcomed those workers who reported to duty on February 23 and asked them to refrain from influencing others to resort to a strike as well as avoid damaging property.None“A valiant strike by Royal Enfield workers has come to an end after the management went on an offensive against striking workers. As the workers struck work through the week, the management has issued transfer orders to five more workers and has dismissed more than 40 trainees,” said a statement from the union.The union decided to send the workers back to work as it considers further strategies. Workers and trainees reported for work this morning and have signed a ‘good conduct’ form as demanded by the management. Those workers and trainees, who have been given transfers and dismissal orders, have not been allowed inside, according to R Sampath, Vice-President, Royal Enfield Employees Union.Royal Enfield workers were demanding regularisation of all workers who complete 480 days of work, besides revoking all transfer orders.Workers are also asking for a provision of bonus for everyone working for more than a month. Another demand of the workers is that trainees employed through National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), an initiative by the Government of India, should not be given work suitable for permanent employees.The union at Royal Enfield's Oragadam plant in a statement on February 19 said the factory employs 5,559 workers, including 1,059 permanent workers, 2,000 contract workers, 1,000 trainees and 1,500 trainees employed through NEEM.The union claims that the company’s management refused to attend a meeting called by the labour department, which had shifted the planned conciliation date from February 26 to February 22.The strike coincided with production ramp-up plans of Royal Enfield for its most celebrated recent launches -- Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650 -- both of which were launched in November.This is not the first time that Royal Enfield saw worker unrest at its factory. In September last year, a large section of the Oragadam plant workers resorted to strike that lasted 50 days and resulted in a production loss of 30,000 units."

content,"Serial investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett recently released his latest letter to shareholders with interesting takeaways for everyone from shareholders, to management professionals, to students.NoneBuffett said that his investments are not based on predicting market behaviour in forthcoming weeks, rather their focus is on calculating whether the intrinsic value of the business is worth more than its market value.IN PICS: Warren Buffett at 88: Five wisdom capsules from the Oracle of OmahaThis tactic deployed by Buffett is known as value investing. Under this strategy, investors seek out stock they believe are being undervalued in the market.Investors who use this method believe that market reactions to day-to-day business operations sway the stock price, which generally is not in line with the company's long-term fundamentals. This overreaction gives the value investor an opportunity to profit buy stocks at a deflated price.NoneApart from giving an important lesson in value investing, Buffett also delved into various topics such as benefits of diversification in portfolio and investment in overpriced stock.Making an analogy between different businesses and trees in a forest, Buffett said, ""It’s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsic business value. That’s because our forest contains five “groves” of major importance, each of which can be appraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety.""""A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade from now.

title,How movement in crude oil price impacts economy and stock market
datetime,2019-02-25 11:38:00+00:00
description,"Shale oil production in the US has increased in recent years, resulting in a decline in oil prices"
content,"William O'Neil IndiaIndia is the net importer of goods ($126 billion in 2017) and oil ($74.7 billion) is the biggest category among imports. India imports 86 percent of its annual crude oil requirement. Since the payments are made in the US dollars, India’s deficit will depend on crude price as well as on the USD/INR exchange rates.The USD and INR conversion in itself is dependent on oil prices, and hence the larger the outflow of US dollar, the sharper will be the rupee depreciation.Importance of crude oil for trade deficit, inflation, and currency:With a weightage of 2.4 percent in the CPI calculation, crude prices have a moderate impact on overall CPI number. However, crude prices impact the cost of producing many goods as it is used as a raw material in many industries.•In 2017, India’s trade deficit was $126 billion (4.8 percent of GDP), and crude contributed 35.1 percent to it. India exported $30.2 billion worth of refined petroleum products compared to imports of $74.7 billion.•India imported 220.4 MT (1.6 billion barrels) of crude oil in 2017-2018, up 3 percent YoY. In rupee terms, it amounted to Rs 5.6 trillion (3.3 percent of India’s GDP), up 20.5 percent YoY.•If rupee depreciates by Rs 1 against the US dollar, import bill will increase by Rs 90 billion (For calculation, $1 = Rs 65 assumption is taken).•Current Account Deficit (CAD) is a measurement of a country’s trade where the value of a country’s imports exceeds that of exports. Crude oil being a major item among imports will have a higher impact on the CAD. Widening CAD further depreciates the rupee against global currencies.What impacts crude oil pricesThe Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has around 81.9 percent of proven crude oil reserves. Within the OPEC, Venezuela (24.9 percent), Saudi Arabia (21.9 percent), Iraq, and Iran (24.9 percent) have the highest reserves.According to the US Energy Information Agency’s report, the US likely has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest crude oil producer. Shale oil production in the US has increased in recent years, resulting in a decline in oil prices.However, shale oil production is expensive compared to traditional oil production. Hence, in mid-2018, the US crude oil production came down due to lower oil prices. With prices rising higher in 2016, they have increased their investment and production.Any production cut by the OPEC would drive the prices higher, but the individual countries do not want to surrender their market share. Geopolitical tensions among OPEC countries have led to a decline in oil prices. It is becoming more difficult to curtail the supply, which is important for the prices to stay higher.Apart from the supply and demand, oil prices are also dependent on speculative traders. Oil futures are one of the actively traded commodities similar to the F&O market. The sudden decline in crude oil prices from $145 in July 2008 to $36 in December can be marginally attributed to the F&O market.What is Brent crude and WTI?Brent crude is extracted from the North Sea, whereas Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) is from oil fields in the US. They differ in the amount of sulfur content; the lower is the sulfur, the easier it is for refining.WTI has 0.24 percent sulfur content whereas Brent crude has 0.37 percent. WTI is the benchmark for oil prices in the US, whereas two-thirds of the world oil contracts are traded in Brent.The difference in these prices is called as WTI vs Brent spread, which is dependent on geopolitical issues, weather, and regulations. As India imports mostly from OPEC countries, Brent crude is the benchmark for India.NoneHigher crude price will have a negative impact on the fiscal and current account deficits of the economy. Increase in these deficits will lead to higher inflation and also impact monetary policy, consumption, and investment behaviour in the economy. A 10 percent increase in oil price will increase the trade deficit by $7 billion, that is, trade deficit will widen by 560bps.NoneIn the oil and gas industry, companies are further divided into upstream or downstream, depending on their role in the supply chain.Upstream companies are those who identify, extract, or produce raw materials that are used by downstream companies to refine them into diesel, gasoline, natural gas, pesticides, and other petroleum products.NoneNoneNoneNoneWhereas oil marketing companies were asked to share less than 1 percent of total subsidies since 2012. As long as the crude prices stay below $60/barrel, the impact of fuel subsidy on these companies would be minimal.In its latest budget, the government decreased fuel subsidy by 5 percent to Rs 20,800 crore. It comes as a negative statement to companies like ONGC and Oil India. These companies P&L would affect adversely because of this move.NoneEnergy stocks have 12.5 percent weightage in the Nifty50 and 15.2 percent in the Sensex. Hence, the Nifty and the Sensex are sensitive to oil price movements. Higher crude prices adversely affect tyre manufacturers, footwear, lubricants, paints, and airline companies.NoneNoneWith respect to refining, the company reported Gross Refining Margin (GRM) of $8.8/bbl in Q3 FY 2019, outperforming Singapore complex margins by $4.5/bbl. The company's exports of refined products increased 19 percent y/y to $6.9 billion aided by volume growth of 5 percent to 10.8 MMT.HPCL, IOCL, and BPCL are trading 53.1 percent, 40.1 percent, and 37.4 percent off-highs, respectively, and below their key levels of 50- and 200-DMA.None(Experts at William O'Neil India, a Bengaluru-based equity research firm, have compiled this article.)"

content,"Jagyaseni BiswasGerman fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who was instrumental in keeping the contemporary appeal of Chanel alive and breathed a new lease of life into Fendi, breathed his last on February 19. While the world mourned the demise of the doyen of the fashion world, none could help but surmise about what the future holds for his equally famous fur ball.There have been talks about his cat Choupette (meaning sweetheart) inheriting a large chunk of the property he left behind, $300 million (1,400 crore), to be precise.NoneAccording to an interview Lagerfeld gave to Numéro last year, he said that as per the will he wrote in 2015, the 8-year-old cat would be an heiress to his vast fortune.The only catch here? Though Lagerfeld is German, he and his kitty were French citizens, and the law there prohibits pets from inheriting owners' wealth.It is now being speculated that Lagerfeld may have then created a foundation, which would inherit the money, only to look after his cat. Or, he may have given Choupette up for foster care and transferred the amount to the concerned person.However, regardless of what happens to the funds, Choupette, a celebrity in her own right with over 2 lakh followers on Instagram, earns a handsome amount from appearing in advertisements. She is the ambassador of French carmaker Opel, and had her own makeup line too.Lagerfeld had once said: ""She has her own little fortune, she is an heiress: If something happens to me, the person who will take care of it will not be in misery… She's a rich girl!""Notably, this is not the first instance of animal inheritance stories raising eyebrows. Real estate tycoon Leona Helmsely passed away in 2007 leaving behind $12 million for her Maltese dog named Trouble. In 1991, German countess Carlotta Liebenstein left her dog Gunther $80 million. A more recent example would be that of Taylor Swift’s cat Olivia Benson with a fortune of $97 million that she earned through participation in various ad campaigns with Diet Coke and Keds sneakers."

M&M, which will not own any of the cabs, today flagged off a fleet of 10 e-Veritos (fully electric versions of Verito). This fleet is owned by Mumbai-based ride hailing company Meru Cabs.Since Glyd will have only electric cars on its app, it is designed on the lines of the Bengaluru–based all-electric cab company Lithium. Ola too started with electric cabs (in Nagpur); however, the response so far has not been encouraging, according to reports.Mahindra hopes that Glyd will get traction in the business and enterprise hubs such as the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and Lower Parel in Mumbai. It will enter more Indian cities at a later stage. As for demand, as per expectations, BKC alone can have a fleet size of 200-400 electric cars while Lower Parel can have around 800-1,600 cars.Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M, said, “Glyd is our unique step to drive positive change towards a smart, sustainable and experiential daily commute. Going forward we plan to launch multiple e-mobility solutions, across cities.""M&M will add more models in Glyd when they are available in the market. Though no official word has come from M&M on the future model range in Glyd, the company is launching the electric version of the KUV100 this year followed by an electric version of the XUV300 next year.NoneGlyd’s pricing will be premium since this is premium service and should be 5-10 percent more than the rates of Ola and Uber alternatives. Privacy screen, air purifier, strain-free lighting, bolstered seats, wrap-around headrest and custom designed armrests are will be featured in the Glyd cars.Within the next year, Mahindra will expand Glyd to other markets. Delhi and Bengaluru have better-charging infrastructure than Mumbai since these cities have been hosting fully electric cars for several months.“Drivers are starting to get confidence about putting an electric vehicle for commercial use. The cost advantages of running an EV is much higher for commercial purposes than running petrol or diesel-powered car,” said a market watcher."

As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines for contactless transaction over Rs 2,000 pin is mandatory.In case, this contactless card gets stolen you need to immediately inform the bank call center and block the card. Alternatively, you can even send an SMS block from registered mobile number to bank with last four digits of your card number.NoneThis is because when you pay in INR it is treated as DCC and their FX markup is then decided by the acquirer bank in that country and that markup and conversion could be at higher rate (3% to 4.5%). Whereas, when you pay in foreign currency, you are basically assured of FX markup and conversion rate which is 1.75% to 2.5% depending on the card and the bank. So, this is inexpensive option compare to DCC.Whereas, in credit card you enjoy the credit period while travelling abroad and pay later when bill gets generated. Further, while using credit cards you earn reward points which are not available in prepaid cards. Also, some of the banks offer higher reward points during international travel then FX markup charges (conversion charges). So, the consumer is net gainer while using credit cards internationally only if reward points are higher than FX markup charges by the bank.None"

title,Adani Ports and SEZ's acquisition of Agri Logistics: More than meets the eye
datetime,2019-02-26 10:30:00+00:00
description,Here's why investors are worried about Adani's latest acquisition.
content,"NoneNoneInvestors have also expressed their apprehensions about promoters pledging of shares, which last stood close to 45.51 percent.All this assumes importance in light of the recent acquisition of a group company Adani Agri Logistics for a consideration of nearly Rs 1,000 crore. Concerns over the acquisition took a toll on its shares yesterday, which closed with a loss of over 8 percent.Here's why investors are worried. Adani Logistics, which is a subsidiary of Adani Port and SEZ will acquire the entire stake from Adani Enterprise. Thus, the deal would not require minority shareholders’ approval.The second question is about valuation. Adani Agri Logistics is valued at Rs 1,662 crore on an enterprise valuations basis, which is equal to 18 times its FY18 consolidated annual EBITDA of Rs 92 crore.Our calculations suggest that to earn its current valuation (enterprise value of Rs 1,662 crore), the company will have to grow EBITDA by 78.39 percent in five years, or 51 percent over seven years.Its own estimated total EBIDTA (mentioned in presentation till 2025) for the next five fiscal is close to Rs 693 crore, which is 42 percent of its enterprise value. Its standalone revenues have grown from Rs 99.84 crore in FY16 to Rs 105 crore in FY18.More than just economic benefitPossibly valuations do not fully reflect the future economic benefits and synergies, which could accrue post the acquisition.The company claims a market share of about 45 percent in the agri logistics space, and has some worthy long term agreements with Food Corporation of India and other state government bodies.It has 1.58 million metric tonne fully contracted capacity (55 percent operational) along with 7 trains and 28 storage & handling infrastructure facilities (only 14 operational).The company also says that post-acquisition the combined EBITDA of Adani Logistics would double and there are several synergistic benefits with Adani Agri Logistics looking to double the capacity.Reading between the linesWhile an opportunity exists, the additional capacity would come as a result ploughing back of post-acquisition profits. Such capacity addition would only add value if these assets earn more than what they are acquired for.That apart, one would read the numbers offered by the company with a pinch of salt in the light of the fact that they were silent about the net profit and net worth of Adani Agri Logistics.Instead, it repeatedly highlighted an EBITDA margin of 72 percent. In an asset-heavy business funded with debt, EBITDA margins are of lesser importance compared to return on capital or return on equity.Similarly, the enterprise value including equity valuation as presented by the company in its documents includes the current value of surplus land of 96 acres based on market benchmarks.While the deal may have merit, it left investors with lot more homework to do before looking at the much-talked about benefits.None"

description,"The bike in the drawing may look conventional, but that obviously won't be the case. The fuel tank hides the batteries that will power the motor, which sits at the bottom of the bike"
content,"While most companies offer some kind of clue to their electric offerings, one manufacturer remained suspiciously missing, Kawasaki. However, there is hope as new leaks of patent drawings have reportedly emerged online.NoneThe bike in the drawing may look conventional, but that obviously won't be the case. The fuel tank hides the batteries that will power the motor, which sits at the bottom of the bike. Now most of this we know. But what appears different is the ram air intake at the front of the bike just like Kawasaki's petrol powered offerings.Batteries on electric bikes can heat up significantly along with electric motors. The intake at the front could stream cool air around the batteries or motor, or maybe even both. However, the engine does get a front-mounted oil-cooler too. This seems to work like a standard cooler and pumps cool oil from the bottom of the motor into the casing to where the central shaft is located.There is one more interesting thing about the drawings and that is the inclusion of a clutch. This may indicate the inclusion of gears too. Most electric bikes usually just send power directly to the rear wheel via the central shaft, but a clutch could mean a higher speed with the motor not being required to work too hard. This could also be better for range as most high powered electric bikes offer don't usually run too far."

content,"NoneOver the past month, the NAA has issued notices to about 10 of Patanjali’s biggest distributors for not reducing prices in line with the cuts in Goods and Services Tax (GST), sources told the newspaper. The notices seek details of prices charged on products, particularly cosmetics.Since the introduction of GST on July 1, 2017, the government has lowered rates on various goods.In October 2018, the anti-profiteering authority had asked Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali to pay Rs 150 crore penalty for not passing on the lowered GST rates to its customers over the last one year. While investigations in this matter are ongoing, media report suggests that the company may appeal against the decision.Editor's Take | Anti-Profiteering rules: What does it mean?NoneApart from Patanjali distributors, the authority is also examining whether prices on consumer goods and pharmaceuticals held by distributors and stockists on June 30, 2017, were reduced after GST kicked in the next day.""The (distributor) was legally bound to pass on the benefit of reduction in the GST rate to customers, which he has not as it is apparent from the invoices,"" the authority said in one of the notices reviewed by the newspaper.Tax experts, however, point out that there’s no prescribed formula to determine whether benefits have been passed on to customers. ""As of now, there is no methodology that the government or NAA has prescribed to arrive at anti-profiteering and so several companies are facing a challenge,"" Abhishek A Rastogi, Partner, Khaitan & Co told the newspaper.Considering there were many tweaks in GST, it would have created a lot of complications for distributors to not just calculate but also pass on the benefits, Rastogi added.Many companies were also uncertain about the time taken to get tax credits and doubts persisted about passing benefits to consumers before or after they received the money from the government.To avoid breaching anti-profiteering norms, some companies changed product composition, according to the report. ""So, a 100 gram cream would become 110 grams. And when details are sought, the companies would say these are two different products and hence prices before and after GST are not comparable,"" a source told the paper.The anti-profiteering authority has asked companies to produce evidence, wherein they have advised their trade partners to pass on the benefit to consumers. Companies, however, are finding it difficult to ascertain whether distributors have passed on the reduced levies."

description,"CRISIL said that companies rated AAA cannot be compared with global ratings. “Comparing the 276 AAA ratings that Indian credit rating agencies (CRAs) have assigned with nine by S&P Global Ratings or 53 by Moody’s is erroneous, and would tantamount to equating differing scales such as Celsius and Fahrenheit,” it said."
content,"AAA-rated companies in India are far lesser in number than corresponding metrics across other national scale ratings in emerging markets (EMs), CRISIL said in a report. However, those rated in the highest bracket cannot be compared with global companies, it said.AAAs in India make up for only 0.85 percent of the overall rated universe, which is far lower than corresponding metrics across other national scale ratings in countries such as China, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea.There has been a steady decline in the number of ‘AAA’ rated companies globally. At S&P Global Ratings, it reduced from 89 a decade back to nine as of January 1, 2018. For Moody’s, it went from 170 to 53.CRISIL highlights that the cost of maintaining an AAA rating could be the reason behind the fall in AAA-rated companies.“The high cost of maintaining AAA-ratings has contributed to this. For an entity to be rated AAA on the global scale, it has to enjoy an extraordinarily strong balance sheet that can withstand stresses on a world scale, and maneuver complex international business environments. That puts severe limits on debt levels and gearing headroom for growth,” it said.“Over the past decade or more, companies in the developed economies have relied more on debt in their quest to increase shareholder value. When reliance on debt increases, financial risk also rises leading to a lowering of credit ratings,” Gurpreet Chhatwal, President, CRISIL Ratings.“The width and depth of the corporate bond markets in these geographies, and ultra-low borrowing costs over the past decade, have also encouraged the shift to debt-driven growth,” he said.South Korea’s Korea Rating, which rates 68 percent of the companies in the country, has rated 17 percent of the portfolio rated as AAA. Similarly, 13 percent of all credit ratings in China are at AAA while the ratio stands at 1 percent for India, 9 percent for Taiwan and 5 percent for Thailand, data showed.NoneCRISIL said that companies rated AAA cannot be compared with global ratings. “Comparing the 276 AAA ratings that Indian credit rating agencies (CRAs) have assigned with nine by S&P Global Ratings or 53 by Moody’s is erroneous, and would tantamount to equating differing scales such as Celsius and Fahrenheit,” it said.By construct, credit ratings can have, and do have different scales. That’s because they are relative assessments of credit risk. And the relative benchmarking can be national, global or regional.Investors in developed economies such as the US and Europe consider investment options across the world. Credit risk assessments that benchmark issuers across the world on a global scale (AAA to D) offer comparable information to them and enables their investment decisions.If 32,500 rated Indian companies were to be assessed on the global scale, their ratings will be boxed on a far narrow bound between BBB category and D on the global scale, because India’s sovereign rating (in the BBB category) will usually serve as a ceiling.On the other hand, a national rating scale affords granular benchmarking of domestic issuers on a 20-point scale (AAA to D) and the sovereign, which has the flexibility to print local currency, is pegged at AAA on this scale."

title,Understanding Social Security Agreements for international workers
datetime,2019-02-26 16:02:00+00:00
description,"India has over the period, signed and operationalized 18 Social Security Agreements with other countries. Benefits such as detachment, exportability of pension, totalisation of benefits and withdrawal of social security benefits are available under these SSAs."
content,"Divya Baweja, Preeti Gupta and Sahil BhasinThe globalisation of the economy and development of international trade and business has considerably increased the international movement of individuals across geographies. The existence of differing regimes in various countries often plays an important role when it comes to cross-border movement of employees or independent workers.NoneTill 2008, foreign nationals exercising employment in India were not covered under the Provident Fund (PF) regulations, since PF contributions were not mandatory where the employees’ pay exceeded the wage ceiling. On the contrary, Indian nationals working abroad were required to contribute to the social security scheme of the respective country. However, these contributions were generally lost due to limited tenure overseas or in failing to fulfill the minimum qualifying period of contribution or residence.NoneIW covers foreign nationals working in an establishment in India which is mandatorily required to contribute to provident fund. As a consequence, every eligible IW was required to be enrolled in the schemes with effect from 1 November 2008. This enabled India to bring to the table other countries which had a significant inbound population into India, to negotiate Social Security Agreements (SSA) with such countries.SSA is a bilateral agreement between India and a foreign country designed to protect the interests of cross border workers. The agreement provides for avoidance of ‘double coverage’ and ensures equality of treatment to workers of both countries from a social security perspective.India, has over the period, signed and made operational 18 SSAs with other countries. Generally benefits such as detachment, exportability of pension, totalisation of benefits and withdrawal of social security benefits are available under these SSAs.Under detachment or elimination of dual contribution, employees moving on employment to any SSA country are exempt from making social security contributions in the host country for a specified period (specific to each SSA), provided they continue to make social security contributions in their home countries. The said benefit can be claimed by obtaining a ‘Certificate of Coverage’ (CoC) from the home social security authorities and submitting the same with the social security authorities of the host country.Further, under the Exportability of Pension clause, the employees may choose to receive benefits of social security in their home country or any other country where they are currently residing (subject to the respective SSA) without any reduction of those benefits, i.e. benefits can be exported.Under the Totalization of Benefits clause, the period of service rendered by an employee in the host country is to be counted for checking the “eligibility” of social security payment in the home country and vice-versa. However, the payment is restricted to the length of service in that country on a pro-rata basis.It may be noted that withdrawal of PF and pension benefits is allowed only once the employee attains the age of 58 years (for non-SSA countries) or depending upon the conditions stipulated in the respective SSA (if any). Hence, in respect of an IW from an SSA country, withdrawal of PF and pension contributions is permissible upon ceasing to be an employee of a covered establishment, subject to meeting of the required criteria.While SSAs are directed towards easing cross-border social security complexities, there are still a few issues and challenges which require attention to maximise benefits from these bilateral agreements. Also since, different SSAs have different terms and requirements, the terms of each SSA needs to be looked at closely so as to reap maximum advantage.Although there are some practical challenges, the PF authorities have been constantly coming out with clarifications in support of the successful implementation of the SSAs. The increase in coverage of countries under the bilateral agreements combined with proper implementation, creates significant benefits for the mobile population, with their employers and hence, is a step in the right direction."

title,L&T rose 32x since Kargil war: Why stocks ride over conflict-induced volatility
datetime,2019-02-27 10:47:00+00:00
description,A big positive which will act as a tailwind for Indian markets is the fact that the air strike removes political uncertainty to a certain extent and brighten chances of Modi 2.0.
content,"Indian market witnessed a knee-jerk reaction on Tuesday when news surfaced that Indian Air Force carried out pre-dawn air strikes on terror camps across the Line of Control (LoC) at Balakot, 12 days after Pulwama terrorist attack in Kashmir.The benchmark indices ended the day off intraday lows which suggests that most of the negatives have been factored in. Even anecdotal evidence suggests that markets have always taken these events in their stride and investors have not lost money. On the contrary, there have times when investors ended up making money during such crises.Another big positive which will act as a tailwind for Indian market is the fact that the air strike removes political uncertainty to a certain extent and brightens chances of Modi 2.0.While the initial response of the financial market has been negative, experts believe that such attacks are unlikely to have any material impact on the markets and investors should use dips to enter markets or buy into select quality stocks.“It could have a sentimental impact on the market, but in economic terms, the real impact should be quite contained. The denial by Pakistan establishment points to the fact that the military escalation may be limited,” Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss Investment Research told Moneycontrol.History suggests that not all terrorist attacks or military actions lead to losses in the equity market. Last two decade’s data suggests many-a-times, the market is unaffected by the news of terrorist attacks or military actions, at least in the short term.During the Kargil conflict in 1999, the benchmark indices — Sensex and Nifty — gained 33 percent each. During the 3-month conflict, the Sensex rallied 1,115 points and Nifty surged 319 points.Similarly, even during the attacks in Mumbai in 2008, the market reaction was surprising. Sensex surged about 400 points in two-day trade during the attack. The Nifty rallied 100 points even as Mumbai was burning.""The initial response of the financial market has been negative, we believe such attacks are unlikely to have any material impact on the markets. For example, the Kargil war was fought between India and Pakistan during May to July 1999 period,"" Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI said in a report.""During the aforesaid period, the leading indices of Indian stock markets showed an initial decline but strong recovery thereafter. The Sensex and Nifty declined 286 points and 79 points in initial 3 trading days, but recovered strongly thereafter and ended higher by 652 points and 191 points when the conflict ended. The overall impact of the Kargil war thus was actually market positive. The economy grew at the same pace in 1999-2000 as the year before - a healthy 6.5%,"" he said.But post the first surgical strike, which was a reply to the Uri attack, Indian financial markets were down with the Sensex falling more than 100 points and the INR appreciating.Ghosh further added that from a longer perspective, Indian financial markets, including the stock, currency and even the bond market showed traction. For example, stock markets jumped by 3,456 points, while the INR appreciated by 2.4 percent.NoneWealth creation opportunity?The impact of air force strike was absorbed by market with ease as indices closed well above their opening levels which is a positive sign. There is a big support for Nifty around 10,650-10,700 levels.But, how can investors leverage this opportunity? Well, time and again markets give us entry points but the real test is when market swings in either direction. Patience is the tool in wealth creation.“If we analyze similar situations in the recent past, after Pathankot, market cracked around 1,400 points, Sensex showed a dip of around 70 points after Uri. Even after surgical strike market slipped to around 500 points,” Shivendra Foujdar, Founder and Managing Partner, Avighna Trades told Moneycontrol.“It was 1999 close to 20 years back when Kargil happened so there are many things which comes in to account if we are calculating wealth creation through stock for said investment period. Still for statistic purpose, if one had invested Rs 1 lakh in L&T around Kargil period, the current valuation would have become Rs 32,70,000 today,” he said.“I would say the market is an opportunity every day, every situation but there is certain discipline one needs to follow,” added Foujdar.Debabrata Bhattacharjee, Head of Research, CapitalAim says the market has always corrected in these type of situations. Whether we have Surgical Strikes or a war-like situation.“These incidents do short-term damage to the index. In the Past, during Kargil War, Indices corrected from higher levels till the war continued. Investors who took part in that correction makes a huge return from their portfolio if they invested in quality or value stocks,” he said."

content,"Yamaha is all geared up to launch the MT-15 in India come March 15 and while prices have not yet been announced, there is chatter that it will retail around Rs 1.25 lakh. At this price point, the MT-15 firmly goes up against the likes of the Bajaj Pulsar NS200 and the KTM 125 Duke.In terms of styling, the MT-15 looks the most aggressive of the lot. The beefy tank and the split headlight set-up will definitely fetch the most attention on the streets. The NS on the other hand has a more subtle, flowy design theme to it, while the Duke borrows its design cues from the bigger 200 Duke and is angular and sharp.NoneSpeaking of headlamps, the MT-15 will get a projector headlamp while the other two on our list get the old halogen lamps. Instrument clusters on the KTM and the Yamaha are fully digital dials, whereas the Pulsar gets a semi-digital console with an analogue tachometer.Now in terms of power trains, the KTM has the smallest with a 124cc engine producing 14.75 PS and 12 Nm of torque. The MT-15 is powered by a 155cc motor and while it does churn out about 19 PS of maximum power, the torque figure falls almost in line with the KTM at 14.7 Nm. The NS200 on the other hand has the biggest engine here with a 199.5cc power plant producing 23.17 PS and 18.3 Nm of torque.NoneIn terms of mechanicals, the KTM is the only one to get upside down forks at the front, while the Yamaha and the Bajaj get conventional telescopic front forks. On the ABS front, the Duke and the Pulsar get single-channel ABS, while the MT-15 is expected to get a dual-channel unit.None"

description,"See, the idea of choosing 'investing' as a career is to become stress-free. But, if you become a short-term or medium-term investor, that you become at the cost of your health and happiness, says Vijay Kedia, MD, Kedia Securities"
content,"Instead of investing in markets or stocks, if you are investing in a company that would mean that your vision is at least for the medium-term, and your vision, as well as time horizon, will grow with the company, Vijay Kedia, MD, Kedia Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.Edited excerpts:Q: From the bountiful year of 2017 to momentum fizzling in 2018 to an equally dormant 2019 till now, what really happened in this span of these three or four years?A: Actually, this is what we have read in childhood that excess of everything is bad. So, this is what is happening in the markets. We drank too much in 2017, and the hangover is yet to end.But, this is not happening for the first time. In 2017 as well as in 2018, there was so much of euphoria in the market that people forgot what should be the PE ratio and, hence, the fair value of their stock. What people remembered was that if you buy today and sell after 15 days, they can get 10-20 percent returns.The number of multibaggers was reduced to a single digit in 2018 compared to what we saw in 2017. So, we can say hardly 5-10 percent of the shares multiplied or carried momentum in 2018.One has to be very selective and at the same time cautious. Please remember investing is a very risky business. Even if everything is in order, related to the financials of the stock, chances are that things may go wrong due to external factors.So, I think after the euphoria of 2017, it looks like that the market is now correcting itself. But, the good part is that most of the correction is already over for the market.At the same time, there is a possibility that some of the pockets will still correct. But, more or less, I think that the correction is over. That is what I could say about my stocks.Q: Do you think the investors should really worry about who would come at the Centre after the general elections?A: I do not worry about elections, because this is an external event which you don’t have any control and thus investors should also not worry about it. If you keep doing the right things in terms of your investment, the health of your portfolio should be fine.See, the elections come and go. Every year there are some elections, so why do you want to gamble with your health by worrying about elections? Data say that for the last 30 years, India's GDP has always grown 5 percent plus irrespective of the government at the centre.So, this tells us that India is in an auto-mode. If any good government comes, the GDP may grow 7 percent or 8 percent. Even if the government is not-so-good (coalition), even then India has grown by about 5 percent.So, I am not actually worried about the outcome of the elections. I am very comfortable with all the investments I have made. I am very sure that in a given time, they will show me good results.Q: You talk about ""smile"", apart from this there is also a concept of ""Chinese Bamboo tree"". Can you throw some more light on it? A: According to me, these investment styles are relevant at all times. These concepts do not change with time. Of course, I am following the principle of ""SMiLE"", which is ""Small in size, Medium in experience, Large in aspiration and Extra-large market potential"".I am certainly following that and whatever investments I have done, you will know that the flavour ""smile"" applies to all my investments.But, one very important thing every investor must understand that until and unless your buying price is cheap, you will not succeed in this market. The reason you feel the pain in this market is because if you have made any investment in 2018, or in late 2018 then you are in loss.But, if you have made investments in the year 2016 or maybe an early part of 2017, then even after this fall of 20-50 percent you are above your cost-price.So that gives me good sleep. Alteast I am not losing my money. My principal is still intact. Whatever money I was making in 2018, today, according to that price, I am losing. But, that is not the way to calculate your returns in the stock market.Q: What is the definition of a good return?A: Well, you cannot calculate returns on a year or 2-year basis if you are long-term investors. In a bull market, it is not given that the stock will multiply every year.Even 15 percent, 10 percent or 5 percent market returns for some years can be called a bull market. In one year, you may double your stock; then maybe for the next 2 years, you will get just 5 percent returns or maybe no returns at all which is also good. So, that is also a bull market.Q: You also recently introduced a concept known as bhangar-cap. So, what exactly is bhangar-cap all about and how should investors avoid getting trapped in these bhangar-caps stocks?A: Bhangar-cap simply means penny stocks. But, not necessarily all penny stocks are bhangar-caps. Remember, all mid, smallcaps are not bhangar-caps.Yes, I have noticed that there are a number of stocks around 2,000-4,000 stocks that rise only in the bull market, and when the bull market gets over, these stocks also come down along with the market.And, we have noticed that there are some stocks where the company is not growing, only the PE multiple is growing in a bull market. Just because the market is euphoric, these stocks multiply or they get better evaluations.When euphoria in the market dies down, the stock price and valuation also come down from 15x to 5x or 6x. I call these stocks also bhangar-caps, which have a very limited scope/side of growing.Q: So you are saying that companies whose earnings are not growing, but multiples are getting elevated...A: Multiples are elevated, but that happens only in one season and that is in a bull market. Not only earnings even the top-line is also not growing which should be your first clue, because the size of the company is not growing. So, those companies are actually in trouble.Q: What is your advice to first-time investors?A: Investing is a 24x7 business and it can’t be your part-time job. If you have a job then the best way to make money is you invest in markets via mutual funds. For new investors and for small investors, this is the clear-cut message, please do not invest in the markets directly.You are playing with fire. You cannot make money without experience, or without failing in this market you cannot pass in this market. This is well written on the wall.The new investors should start their career with mutual funds. Then side-by-side they should keep on learning which might take 3-5 years.Once you have gained enough experience, investors should think of investing directly in the markets. Because, as I said earlier, this is a very risky business and you cannot predict the markets.Q: In one of your ted-talks you mentioned, ""Success is a series of accidents"". How many accidents did you experience, before you got the success formula right?A: Oh, I do not remember how many accidents. Even today, I am facing accidents. Accidents come in one form or another. So yeah, that's the process of life. You have to learn from your mistakes and the idea is not to repeat the same mistakes again.If you have not failed in the stock markets then you are in the danger zone. Success and accidents are like two sides of the coin of the stock market.Q: You have a knack of spotting good stocks that give higher returns or generate wealth for investors. What are the key parameters for retail investors or new investors, who want to invest in the stock market for the first time?A: First-time investors should stick with mutual funds. I think the government should ban new investors coming and investing directly into the market, otherwise, you are just ruining your wealth.For direct investing, my principles and fundamentals are very simple. Buy stocks that are actually very cheap, and do not look at the market. I have another concept as well.Either you are investing in the markets or you are investing in the stocks or you are investing in the company. Now-a-day, I am attuning my mind that neither I am investing in the markets, nor I am investing in the stocks, but I am actually investing in the company.If I am investing in the company, this thought process only will change the way you think. If you are investing in a company that means your vision is at least for the medium-term. If you are investing in the company then your vision will grow with the company.See, the idea of choosing 'investing' as a career is to become stress-free. But, if you become a short-term or medium-term investor, that you become at the cost of your health and happiness.Q: There are so many domestic and external factors impacting the markets, should investors be cautious? A"" When you mentioned the word ""cautious"", again it depends on what is the horizon of your investment. If you are invested only for one year then you have to be very cautious.But, if you are invested in the company then your horizon is about 10 years. In that case, you do not have to be cautious. Let the management of the company be worried about all your investments. Why are you worried?There is another quote from my side: ""Buy like a bull, sit like a bear and watch like an eagle"". So, for me after investing, the only work that is left is to watch my companies.Whatever development is going on in India or in the world, whether my company is going to be affected—that is the only job which I am left with after investing. I am watching all the development that is taking place in India very closely. That's it. This is the approach I have."

title,IAF pilot Abhinandan's capture by Pakistan brings back memories of Kargil war hero Kambampati Nachiketa

content,"After the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed that an Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by Pakistan during the standoff on February 27, memories of the last time the neighbouring country captured an Indian pilot rushed back.During the Kargil War, Flight Lieutenant Kambampati Nachiketa was captured after his MiG-27 suffered a flameout while destroying enemy positions in the Batalik subsector.Nachiketa, now the Group Captain, ejected at 18,000 ft while his plane started spiralling down but he had landed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. He was saved from Pakistani fire by a senior military officer and was taken into custody.Indo-Pak Conflict | How Geneva Conventions can be invoked to bring our IAF pilot backIndia also lost another pilot — squadron leader Ajay Ahuja, who was looking for Nachiketa after he saw the Flight Lieutenant eject from the flight.

Nachiketa was captured by Pakistan on May 27, 1999, and was repatriated to India on June 3 of that year.While video footage of Abhinandan ""being treated well"" by the Pakistani army has been doing the rounds on social media, Nachiketa's eight-day stay in Pakistani custody was different — filled with ""severe mental and physical torture"".Catch LIVE updates of developments after IAF struck JeM's terror camp in Balakot on Feb 26""It was very tough. I can't describe that experience in words. That time I thought maybe death is a simpler solution. But I am thankful to God that destiny was on my side. I underwent severe mental and physical torture there for three-four days,"" Nachiketa told Hindustan Times during an interview in 2016.While Nachiketa thought that he would never return, he said: ""There comes a point where you think ‘death is simpler’, but fortunately for me, the third-degree part, which is the last part, didn’t start for me.""Meanwhile, India, as well as international media, had started mounting pressure on Pakistan for the release of K Nachiketa. Bowing to scrutiny media and other nations, Pakistan finally handed over Kambampati Nachiketa to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Pakistan.

Close to 45 percent of the respondents are from non-metro cities.The respondents were surveyed across various key sectors comprising IT (hardware and software), banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), engineering and construction, production and manufacturing, automotive, healthcare  and pharma, and telecom and education.The report states that one-third of young professionals find technology such as laptops and mobile phones a hindrance in managing family and work commitments. This includes 54 percent of the respondents who were single and 26 percent of the respondents who were from IT and ITES sectors, those which are viewed as ‘flexible’, the report pointed out.Other hindrances that surfaced contributing to poor work-life balance were meetings, calls and training after office hours accounting for about 18 percent and negative attitude of supervisors towards work-life balance despite the policy coming to about 11 percent.The daily commute to office emerged as a key contributor for poor work life balance. About 75 percent of the respondents on an average spend minimum an hour and maximum of more than two hours on the road traveling to work. About 70 percent of respondents said that they either would like to work from home to avoid the commute, or at least have some days to work from home due to the time spent on the road.Another impact of poor work life balance could be seen increasing health issues. Close to 67 percent the professionals have stated that they often or always think about work when not at work. Lack of sleep at 17 percent, depression at 16 percent, anxiety and irritability at 9 percent, hypertension at 4.5 percent came up as the top work-related illnesses. 15 percent of the respondents reported back pain, 14 percent reported frequent headaches and fatigue, and 5 percent reported obesity up as other stress-related physical illnesses.About half of the respondents in relationships confessed that the lack of work life balance makes them or their partners irritable and ill-tempered.Other aspects to work life balance include wanting flexible work hours and a significant portion of them wanting time to pursue their hobby and passion. Close to 22 percent feel that taking time off regularly is how they define work life balance.The report states that these findings indicate that employers either need to establish such policies soon or need to find more effective ways of communicating them if they already have one. In organisations where there is a work life balance policy, the top three provisions offered were flexible work hours at 62 percent, holidays at 46 percent, and pursuing their hobby and passion at 25 percent."

description,Organised players continues to face a tough operating environment amid heightened competitive intensity from unorganised player
content,"Moneycontrol ResearchCompanies in the tile and sanitaryware space had a mixed Q3 FY19. Growth in topline was primarily aided by healthy consumer demand during the festive season. Recent price hikes along with softening commodity prices and strengthening of the rupee versus the dollar lent support to operating margins on a sequential basis. Margins, however, continued to remain under pressure on a yearly basis.NoneNoneAsian Granito’s eight percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in volume was on account of higher share from the trading business. The same for Kajaria was much stronger than competitors and stood at 16 percent for Q3 FY19. In comparison, Somany’s strategy of rationalising its working capital continued to impact its sales volume, which came in softer at 8 percent.NoneFor Cera, topline growth of 10 percent was driven by strong growth in its faucets segment, which increased more than 20 percent YoY. However, the increase in sanitaryware revenue was muted at five percent.NoneMargins in Q3 came in better for all the players as stabilisation in power and fuel cost and price hikes aided improvement in margins. Besides, Cera also benefited from weakness in metal prices (mainly copper), which alleviated cost pressures in its faucets business (23 percent of revenue).NoneNoneThe residential real estate sector witnessed a declining trend in new launches as the inventory pile-up continues to remain at elevated levels, given the lack of demand from mid- to high-end customer segments. The ongoing liquidity squeeze (emerging from the fall out of IL&FS) has further dented the fortunes of real estate developers. The sector has been lagging for the past 5-6 years and a revival seems around the corner as the government is taking various initiatives (interest subsidies and GST rate cuts) to sweeten the deal for new homebuyers.NoneSomany’s business appears to be undergoing business transition as the management continues to tighten its working capital cycle, which would take one-to-two quarters more for stabilisation. On the valuation front, Asian Granito appears cheapest among the lot but the emergence of corporate governance issues after the arrest of CEO will continue to have an overhang on the stock in a volatile market environment.Cera’s operating performance was stronger in comparison to others but the core business (sanitaryware) had a sluggish quarter. While the sanitaryware business is anticipated to growth in mid-to-high single-digits, its future earnings will be driven by newer product segments (tiles, faucets, water heaters, wellness, etc), which continue to gain market traction.NoneAmong the four companies in the tiles and sanitaryware segment, Kajaria’s resilience in terms of topline and bottomline has been quite noteworthy as the company has delivered higher volume growth than its competitors as well as the industry. Also, the company has been able to arrest the fall in its margin through strict cost control measures.Kajaria as well as Cera are our preferred picks from the sector as the resilience in their operational performance indicates the management’s execution capabilities in a tough market environment. Although both the stocks seems fairly priced at current valuations (Kajaria: 29 times and Cera: 26 times estimated FY20 earnings), they would continue to command a premium to their competitors. Long-term investors should keep on accumulating them on dips.Follow @Sach_PalNone"

AI plays a significant role here. The technology helps in developing an understanding of the customer before disbursing a loan.Another area where automation technologies make a huge difference today is cybersecurity.

How did you prepare the legacy environment for the new technology?NoneOne of the major challenges was to make a few modifications in the core business applications so that the integration with new technology would be smooth. The integration challenges were mostly due to external factors. We applied our expertise and domain knowledge to handle it. We are in the constant zest to search for better technology which can result in RoI and due to that legacy systems are not much of a problem for us.Q: Typically, a new technology might result in replacing some of the old applications or infrastructure, which is a big cost factor.

title,Opinion | Pakistan has paid a heavy price for supporting terrorists
datetime,2019-02-27 17:29:00+00:00
description,The economic cost to Pakistan for fanning the flames of religious extremism has been very high.
content,"Manas ChakravartyIn 1990, Pakistan's per capita income, according to the International Monetary Fund, was 1.6 times India’s. In 2000, it was 1.3 times. But in 2010, India’s per capita income crossed that of Pakistan for the first time (see chart below).NoneLast year, the IMF estimates India’s per capita income was 1.4 times Pakistan’s. The data illustrates how Pakistan's wrong policies, including its policy of trying to extract political mileage by fanning religious passions, have affected its economy.To be sure, there are many reasons why Pakistan has lost out, including political instability, faulty economic policies and widespread corruption, but religious fanaticism and the Army's pernicious doctrine of a covert war through proxy terror outfits against India as well as Afghanistan has taken a toll on the economy. For example, a 2015 research paper from Pakistan universities titled 'Impact of Terrorism on Economic Development of Pakistan' comes to the conclusion that, over the period 1981-2012, 'terrorism has negatively affected the economic growth in Pakistan. Among the various variables that were used, terrorism is most significant and major contributor in reducing the economic growth.' That's apart from the huge cost in terms of human lives lost and blighted.The policy of supporting terrorists has boomeranged badly, with bomb attacks a dime a dozen within Pakistan. This has scared away investment in general and foreign investment in particular. Pakistan’s economic survey estimated that the cost of 'fighting militancy' since 9/11 was as high as $123 billion.' The chart below, taken from the IMF database, shows how India's investment to GDP ratio has improved over the decades, while Pakistan's has deteriorated.NoneA research paper from universities in Lahore titled 'Extremist and Religious Violence: An Economic Overview of Pakistan', says 'terrorism and violent extremism has created a bad name for the country thereby disturbing the investment climate adversely. Increased defense expenditure has reduced public and private investment and areas afflicted with extremism have faced downward spiral in economic activity.' Pakistan's military expenditure, according to the World Bank, was 3.5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product in 2017, compared to India’s 2.5 per cent.The State Bank of Pakistan has said of extremist violence in the country: 'apart from causing immeasurable human suffering, including casualties and mass displacement, the war had helped drive away foreign investment, stall domestic investment, freeze exports, and slow down trade.'What has kept Pakistan afloat is aid from its friends. They have been more than generous, particularly when they needed Pakistan to support them in Afghanistan. Official development assistance amounted to 2.7 per cent of Pakistan's GDP in 1990 and that has since gone down to 0.7 per cent by 2017. Compare that with development assistance to India at 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1990 and a mere 0.1 per cent of GDP in 2017. The numbers are sourced from World Bank data (see chart).NonePakistan has long been a basket case, but they are feeling the full brunt of their wrong-headed policies only now, with the flow of funds being squeezed."

He is believed to have spent years along with his mother in Iran, despite Al-Qaeda's strident denunciations of the Shiite branch of Islam that dominates the country.Observers say that the clerical regime in Tehran kept him under house arrest as a way to maintain pressure on rival Saudi Arabia as well as on Al-Qaeda, dissuading the Sunni militants from attacking Iran.One of Hamza bin Laden's half-brothers told The Guardian last year that Hamza's whereabouts were unknown but that he may be in Afghanistan."

content,"The Centre banned the Jamat-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir for five years under anti-terror law on grounds that it was ""in close touch"" with militant outfits and is expected to ""escalate secessionist movement"" in the state.A notification, banning the group under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs after a high-level meeting on security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The notification said the Centre is of the opinion that the Jamaat is ""in close touch with militant outfits"" and is supporting extremism and militancy in Jammu and Kahsmir and elsewhere.It said the outfit claims ""secession of a part of the Indian territory from the union"" and supporting terrorist and separatist groups fighting for this purpose.The notification, which came barely a few days after the Jammu and Kashmir Police had arrested around 100 cadres of the group in the state, said Jamaat has been indulging in activities intended to disrupt the territorial integrity of India.During the intervening night of February 22 and 23, the police had carried out a crackdown on Jamaat cadres and arrested 100 across the valley, including its chief Abdul Hamid Fayaz and advocate Zahid Ali (spokesperson).The action came following the February 14 terrorist attack in Pulwama, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.There have been allegations in the past that the group was a political outfit of banned terror organisation Hizbul Mujahideen but the group has denied.The Centre is also of the opinion that the group is ""involved in anti-national and subversive activities in the country intended to cause disaffection"".While banning it under the anti-terror law, the Centre reasoned that the group was intending to escalate its subversive activities, including attempt to carve out Islamic state out of the Union of India by destablising the government established law.The group is also expected to escalate secessionist movement, support militancy and incite violence in the country, the notification said.The group has been banned for five years. It has to be ratified by a tribunal constituted by the Home Ministry.The outfit, which was formed in 1945 as a chapter of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and separated in 1953 due to differences over political ideology with the parent body, was banned in 1990.The previous ban lapsed in 1995 and since then it has never been invoked again.The party, with pro-Pakistan leaning during the Plebiscite Front days and also during the eruption of militancy, pitches itself as socio-religious organisation working mainly in the field of education and awareness about Islam.The Jamaat-e-Islami was an influential founder member of the undivided Hurriyat Conference from its inception in 1993 till 2003, when the amalgam suffered a vertical split led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani over alleged proxy participation in 2002 Assembly polls by some leaders of the People's Conference led by Sajad Gani Lone.The Jamaat withdrew from the Hurriyat and decided to focus on its social work while maintaining its separatist stand on Kashmir issue.The cadre-based party has a powerful Majlis-e-Shoora (advisory council) which takes decisions on important issues through consensus."

content,"Sweden-based music streaming giant Spotify launched in India on February 27 after much anticipation. The streaming service, famed for its curated playlists and podcasts, is entering India's growing music streaming market, to compete with the likes of Apple Music, JioSaavn, Amazon Music and Gaana.Parent company Spotify AB reportedly gave Rs 48 crore to the Indian arm. ""India has an incredibly rich music culture, and to best serve this market we're launching a custom-built experience. Not only will Spotify bring Indian artists to the world we will also bring the world’s music to fans across India,"" said Daniel Ek, Spotify's founder and CEO.As it is a new entrant in India, Spotify is in the process of developing Hindi as well as regional music content on the application.India's music streaming marketRevenue from India's streaming market is expected to be around $213 million in 2019. It is supposed to grow at an annual compound growth rate of 1.6 percent and reach $227 million by 2023. User penetration in 2019 was 6.5 percent in 2019, which may go up to 7 percent by 2023.The biggest market is the US with expected revenue of $4.3 billion in 2019.These applications, that let you play music and download them onto your cloud, became famous over the past decade, with various players struggling to one-up each other. They charge a monthly subscription fee (without any advertisements) or provide ad-supported music.NoneCompetitorsSpotify comes with an already diverse and enormous following in India, which is why it may prove to be a tough competitor to the well-established apps.As of March 2018, more than half of the customers were using Google Play Music to stream music, while the second most-used streaming service was JioSaavn. Gaana, Wynk and Hungama had small shares of the industry, while Apple Music and Amazon Music are relatively new to the market.NoneSpotify has launched special plans for its premium service, like JioSaavn's Pro or Gaana Plus. The Premium plan would be free for the first 30 days following which users would have to pay Rs 119 a month. The premium prepaid plan, apart from an annual subscription, also includes one-day, weekly, monthly, quarterly and half-yearly plans ranging from Rs 19 to Rs 1189.Apple charges Rs 120/month for its services in India, while Jio Saavn charges Rs 120 for its Lite version and Rs 250 for the Pro version. Google Play, on the other hand, charges Rs 99 a month. Amazon Music is the cheapest, charging Rs 1,000 a year.Spotify has already partnered with T-Series and Sony, while it battles in the court with Warner Music Group for music rights in India."

content,"Italian supercar manufacturer Ferrari teased the world with the first official photographs of its upcoming supercar. Christened the F8 Tributo, the new mid-engine RWD car is the next in line after the 488 GTB and will debut at the Geneva Motor Show in a few days. Ferrari claims it is going to be a lighter, more powerful and aerodynamically optimised successor.Powered by Ferrari’s award-winning 4-litre V8, the Tributo makes 710 bhp and 770 Nm of peak torque. All of this comes as low as 3,250 rpm. So practically, the driver will have a massive power-band should he choose to go flat out.The car also promises to reach 100 km/h from a standstill in 2.9 seconds and reach 200 km/h in 7.8 seconds. This is thanks to a Launch system in the gearbox, activated by a button on the centre console. The F8 has also been given compact, horizontal LED headlights to make space for accommodating brake cooling intakes.Taking a cue from the Formula One and Le Mans machines, Ferrari has paid special attention to the aerodynamics of the supercar. This brings in the ‘S-duct’ vent on the frond hood, as well as an aero device to keep the front wheel on the road."

content,"Hybrid and electric vehicles (EV) manufacturers have greeted with cheer the 10-fold rise in the assistance package announced by the Centre to promote ‘greener mobility.'On February 28, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved a Rs 10,000 crore package under the second phase of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) for three financial years. FAME-I, which had started in 2015, had a total outlay of Rs 895 crore.Besides providing direct subsidy to buyers of electric vehicles, the total outlay also encompasses setting up of allied ecosystem such as a charging station, technical know-how and testing facilities.NoneFollowing a steady rise in prices of petrol and a sustained launch of new models, demand for electric two-wheelers have been encouraging for manufacturers. As per data available, nearly 55,000 electric two-wheelers were sold during 2017-18, a growth of 138 percent compared to 2016-17. FAME-I provides incentives ranging between Rs 7,500 to Rs 22,000 on battery powered 2Ws.NonePawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M, said, “The new outlay of Rs 10,000 crore over a period of three years provides a stable policy to promote green mobility in India. It addresses the key issues including National Energy Security, mitigation of the adverse impact of vehicles on the environment and growth of domestic technology and manufacturing capabilities. The revised FAME II removes all uncertainty and will put adoption of electric vehicles in the fast lane.”In all, more than 2.65 lakh vehicles were provided support under the FAME I scheme through subsidy, creation of charging stations and providing technological support.FAME II plans to support 1 million e-two-wheelers, 500,000 e-three-wheelers, 55,000 four-wheelers and 7,000 buses. Around 2,700 charging stations will be established in major cities, cities with million plus population, smart cities and cities in hilly states.There will be at least one charging station in a grid of 3 km x 3 km. Charging stations are also proposed on major highways on both sides of the road at an interval of around 25 km each.In February, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprise constituted NATRIP Implementation Society (NATIS), an autonomous body for the execution of National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP).NATIS has been entrusted to set-up state-of-the-art automotive test facilities at seven locations across the country at an investment of Rs 3723.30 crore.

description,The policy offers seven options of sum insured ranging from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 40 lakh and above
content,"Any theft or break-ins into a bank branch would mean that your jewellery and other valuables in the locker are at risk. To protect against that, non-life insurance company IFFCO Tokio General Insurance has launched a bank locker protector policy.This is the first such cover in the industry specifically for bank lockers. At present, a list of home insurance covers offer protection for contents of the bank locker as well. However, these have sub-limits of around Rs 1-2 lakh. This means that claims only up to that amount will be payable.Bankers also take liability policies that cover any potential thefts that may occur in the bank, including loss of cash and contents. But since locker contents are not declared to bank officials by individuals prior to being deposited, it is difficult to fix a liability on the jewellery or precious items kept in the lockers.IFFCO Tokio General’s offers a cover against various risks including fire, earthquake, burglary, infidelity by a bank staff or any act of terrorism. Apart from jewellery and valuables, one can also insure important documents kept in a locker as an add-on cover. The policy can be sold both as a retail and a group policy for banks.Warendra Sinha, MD and CEO, IFFCO Tokio General Insurance, said, ""In view of the demand from several of our customers, we have launched this innovative standalone product for people, who do not want to club the items in the bank locker along with any other conventional insurance product.""The process to buy is simple and easy as it just needs a self-declaration up to a specified limit. Valuation report from government approved valuers is required only where value of an individual item is more than Rs 10 lakh and where the total sum insured exceeds Rs 40 lakh for an individual.For filing a claim, they only require basic documents like the claim form along with supporting documents such as invoices and proof.The policy offers seven options of sum insured ranging from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 40 lakh and above. The premium rate is affordable, with a cover of Rs 3 lakh available at Rs 300."

title,Tripura likely to see a business boom but challenges remain
datetime,2019-02-28 14:36:00+00:00
description,Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb is optimistic about improving the quality of rubber production as well as the yield.
content,"RN BhaskarNoneIn some  ways, Tripura has been luckier than most other North Eastern states.  Its decadal population growth has been quite close to the national decadal growth of population of 17.7% especially since the 1990s. There has been little influx of migrants since then. Moreover, with the state being bordered by Bangladesh on three sides – the fourth side is connected to India), the normalising of relations between Bangladesh and India has meant a great deal of peace for this state.NoneThat is one reason why the state government now wants Tripura to notch up plans to become a big exporter of goods and services.  Hitherto, it has largely been an importer.  It imports rice, vegetables, clothes and building material. Even milk (often in the form of powder). Much of this is paid for by oil and gas (more on this later) and by the rubber industry.Tripura remains the second largest producer of rubber in India (after Kerala) though the state has done nothing to put this distinction on the map of this country.  Even the rubber board makes a passing reference to Tripura.NoneBut its contribution remains unknown and the private sector is also to be blamed. True, Tripura has the second largest number of licensed dealers in India for rubber – Kerala has 6,686, but Tripura trails at 529 (country total 8,252 -- pg 81 of the report), And when it comes to applying for additional licences in 2016-17, there were 734 applications from Kerala, and only 4 from Tripura.NoneNoneDeb is trying to lure investors to use natural gas to extract carbon black which can be used with natural rubber for tyre production.""We are trying to persuade investors to come here and use our resources,” he told this correspondent. The fact remains that India is a booming market. It is the fourth largest tyre market in the world. The industry itself accounted for an annual turnover of $ 12,700 million in the year 2015-16, with the tyre sector contributing to $7,600 million, non-tyre sector $ 5,100 million and export $ 2,300 million. India is the sixth largest producer of natural rubber, and the second largest consumer of natural rubber (for industries as diverse as balls to balloons)Another industry Tripura is focussed on is milk. It believes it could be a major player in the dairy farming and livestock rearing business. In December 2018, a team from Amul (actually Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation) flew into Agartala to work out ways with the state to develop dairy farming there.NoneThe North East imports milk (usually milk powder) worth around Rs.18,000 crore each year, with Tripura accounts for Rs 1,100 crore).  Tripura will now be connected through Chittagong to almost all the other South East Asian countries which are also milk-deficient.  Thus, Tripura could have two major markets – North East India, and south east Asia.  Of course, this will also make it a hub for meat and leather-goods as well.Another focus area is travel and tourism.  Tripura has some of the most picturesque spots – lake palaces, sanctuaries and places of exquisite natural beauty. But the chief minister’s primary focus is on spiritual tourism.  His reasoning is simple.  Some of the holiest of shrines – especially those related to Shiva and Devi – can be found here.  Pilgrims are less fussy about accommodation and travel comforts.  So that could be a good place to start.  The improvement in accessibility by air, road, river and rail will only help the state bring in more tourists.""Today, we do not have a single four-star or five-star hotel. We will improve our lodges in our places of tourism, and then begin advertising them as well,"" he says.Travel and tourism is indeed a great way to make money, increase visibility and create employment.There are other markets as well.  Tripura imports around 20,000 tonnes of fish annually (from Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Bangladesh).  It has already created nurseries for fish fingerlings for farmers as every rural household has a backyard pond. The government wants to boost fisheries both for local consumption as well as for exports.But a big ambitious plan is medical tourism.  Almost 85,000 Bangladeshis come to India each year, spending almost Rs 4 lakh each, for medical needs.  Deb wants to change this.  He has already offered the two biggest hospitals in Agartala to the largest hospital chains in India.“We are in discussions. Once we clinch the deal, it will benefit both Tripura and the Bangladeshis. We will develop the medical tourism business, while the Bangladesh patients will save at least Rs 1 lakh on travel, because we are next door,"" he says.NoneNew varieties of rice and fish feed are being developed.  So is cattle feed for the cows.  The state has already given away some 1,000 cows, and wants to increase the population by 10,000 more within a couple of years.All this could be good news to investors and businessmen.  But there is a fly in the ointment.  Such plans are not backed up with data.  The state’s websites have little or no information.  Even figures sent to the government are missing.  Take the Economic survey for instance (see table). Data for Tripura is missing.Unless you have reliable data, you cannot plan reliably.  Money does not come easily into places where there is uncertainty.  Data lends credibility and certainty. If only the state could do that, it is quite possible that investors will begin to flock there."

title,What explains a relatively steady show by the FMCG companies?
datetime,2019-03-01 09:07:00+00:00
description,None
content,"NoneNoneIn recent months, there has been a noticeable slowdown in discretionary consumption. Automobile sales growth across categories has been lacklustre since Diwali. A macroeconomic slowdown, rural distress, sluggish rural wage growth and abysmal farm income have been blamed as the main culprits. Additionally, a change in the business dynamics of the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) led to a moderation in credit availability for consumer purchases. But when we look at the other end of the consumption spectrum of staples, the steady volume growth appears intriguing.Source: Ace Equity, Moneycontrol ResearchA look at Q3 FY19 results for major FMCG companies show that volume growth has been steady for most companies. The sector appears to have successfully tackled the challenges of GST implementation (Q1 FY18) and demonetisation (Q3 FY17). One reason why FMCG goods may be doing better compared to discretionary goods is that their sales are not dependent on easy availability of institutional credit.Additionally, some of the discrepancy between demand growth numbers for four-wheelers and consumer goods such as soaps could be more fundamental — relative demand stickiness for the latter. Demand for FMCG goods, particularly staples such as food grains, is relatively inelastic.Source: Moneycontrol researchHowever, look beyond robust headline volume growth and one finds weak consumer sentiments are making an appearance. Customers are trading down to cheaper products. There is growing competition in the market for low-priced variants. For instance, though Marico posted decent volume growth of nine percent (Q3 FY19) in coconut oil for its flagship brand (Parachute), sales of low-margin brands (Nihar Naturals and Oil of Malabar) were affected due to higher competitive intensity from companies such as Dabur. In oral care Dabur’s low priced Babool continues to face high competitive intensity, and Colgate’s profit margin on smaller or low-priced packs came under pressure.While the growth numbers of FMCG companies were good, the bullishness in management commentary on outlook for growth has begun to moderate. In the September quarter, Bajaj Consumer Care highlighted a slack in wholesale pick up and Dabur underlined rural growth moderation. In the December quarter, Dabur mentioned that relative rural demand growth (versus urban), adjusting for modern trade, is about two percent which is lower than historical average of 3-4 percent. Further, Emami estimated just a tad higher relative growth in rural areas and Britannia noted demand moderation in recent months.Still, the aggregate sales growth of the FMCG sector in recent times is impressive. This is better understood if take a longer time period. During CY13-16, there was a noticeable deceleration in the sales growth of listed FMCG companies – a key reason was heightened competitive intensity from new companies that included Patanjali Ayurved.NoneDemonetisation and implementation of the Goods & Services Tax affected topline growth, as it adversely affected both supply and demand side temporarily. Subsequently, companies which were better placed in terms of product positioning, distribution reach and cost savings utilised the opportunity to regain lost ground.Source: HULIn the last couple of years, HUL has invested on developing its naturals category (Lever Ayush). It streamlined its supply chain, helping it improve reach and response. For instance, in Q3, the company’s winter portfolio displayed better execution than peers despite a delayed and harsh season. Dabur recouped market share in health supplements and displayed stellar performance in higher priced units of its oral care brands.NoneListed companies, in particular, were helped as the aggressive marketing push by Patanjali abated in the past two years. However, higher competitive intensity from unlisted companies continues in few other categories such as beverages (tea, juices) and household insecticides.We expect mid to high single-digit domestic volume growth to sustain for the FMCG sector as companies consolidate their direct distribution reach and grow their share of modern trade and e-commerce channels.Follow @anubhavsays"

content,"Moneycontrol Research -------------------------------------------------NoneNoneNoneSource: CompanyThe slippage in Q3 may just be the tip of the iceberg as the bank has guided to significantly high level of slippage in the coming five quarters (till FY20-end). The management has guided to gross slippage of Rs 1,850 crore (Rs 750 crore from corporate, Rs 1,000 crore from commercial and Rs 100 crore from retail). With a decent recovery, net slippage is expected to be of the order of Rs 1,100 crore.In addition to the identified pain, the bank expects some more from other quarters that could take the total net slippage to Rs 1,300 crore.The moot point to take note of is the deterioration in the underlying quality of the book. Assuming that there is no further deterioration beyond what the management is indicating, even then the quality of the book is quite unnerving.Source: Company, Moneycontrol ResearchThe guidance by KVB assumes importance in the context of warning signals highlighted by industry leaders like Uday Kotak, who feels that the pain in the small and medium enterprise (SME) segment can be substantial.For KVB, the other area of concern is a far lower provision coverage (provision held against NPA) compared to corporate focused banks in general and peer private sector banks in particular. The provision coverage ratio at the end of December 2018 stood at 43.4 percent. With the management intending to step up the provision coverage to 60 percent by FY19-end, reported earnings will be under pressure.If we look at some of the other business parameters, they fail to enthuse and are unlikely to show positive surprise in the near term as the stressed asset portfolio will largely consume management bandwidth.As per the latest reported numbers, for the quarter-ended December, KVB’s deposits and advances grew by 3.3 percent 7 percent, respectively, much lower than the system. The bank has close to 0.5 percent share of system’s advance and deposits and has been losing market share with its incremental share in advances at 0.2 percent and deposits at 0.1 percent.The bank has a lot of catching up to do to get its liability profile right. The share of low-cost deposits (CASA) has been hovering around the 30 percent mark, much inferior to the best in class in the market. We feel, cost of funds would be key differentiator in accruing incrementally better quality assets in a competitive landscape where everyone seems to be chasing high-rated assets.Source: CompanyIn the absence of significant improvement in the cost of funds side, large baggage of bad assets restricts margin improvement.The initiatives on technology implementation is gathering steam and the new CEO PR Seshadri (former Citi banker) appears to be guiding the bank in the right direction, although the overt results aren’t fully visible yet.As of now, home loan, loans against property, unsecured personal loan and working capital renewal is on the digital platform and the bank is putting commercial banking on this platform, which will enable better pricing of risk.The bank is strengthening risk management processes and consciously reducing the ticket size of corporate loans. It is introducing new scorecard method of underwriting that will reduce the judgemental element in decision making. The effort is also to centralise key decision making.There is no need to raise capital in the near term (CAR 14.59 percent) and with the weakening competitive landscape (thanks to the weakness from the PSU pack), there is headroom for growth.However, the ongoing efforts of the management might bear fruit only gradually. Numbers are likely to remain uninspiring in the near term. So, while we do not rule out a better FY21, should all bad asset recognition gets complete in FY20, investors with a long-term horizon should get in only at a level where the downside looks limited.NonePost correction, the stock trades at 1.2 times FY20 estimated adjusted book. Given the challenges that confront the bank, a further correction of close to 15 percent bringing the valuation to one-time FY20 estimated book cannot be ruled out. We advise investors to wait for this downside to play out.NoneNone"

content,"Samsung launched the Galaxy S10e as the budget S10 model. Samsung compromises on quite a few features to make the S10e standout as the budget variant. The two most noticeable of which are the in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and the third telephoto camera. However, compromising on these two features by no means makes the S10e a bad-buy.The S10e comes in at Rs 55,900, little over a thousand rupees more than the S9 Plus. So how does Samsung’s S series flagship of 2018 stand up against their budget S10 variant? Let’s find out.The Galaxy S10e runs on the same Exynos 9820 chipset as the S10 and S10 Plus, while the S9 Plus runs on the Exynos 9810 chipset. The Exynos 9820 is fabricated on an 8nm process, while the Exynos 9810 is fabricated on a 10-nm process. While this will ensure a reduction in power consumption on the S10e, the additional 400 mAh battery capacity on S9 Plus should level things out.The S10e also boasts 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as compared to the 6GB of RAM and the 64GB storage on the S9 Plus.The new Mali-G76 GPU cores on the Exynos 9820 touts a 40-percent performance boost and 35-percent power efficiency gains on its predecessor. Resulting in smoother performance on visually-intense applications and games.The standout feature on the new Exynos 9820 is the addition of a dedication neutral processing unit (NPU) for AI tasks. Adding this standalone NPU to the chip will offer seven times faster AI-related task execution than the Exynos 9810.Its worth remembering that better AI processing on the S10e will also deliver better image processing results."

content,"None1999 was the year Yamaha came out with the OW02 also known as Yamaha YZF-R7. But it was not just another bike in the Japanese motorcycle’s lineup; it was designed with a specific mission -- to be the best in the world.The R7 succeeded the OW01 motorcycle which was due to retire after years of competing in the coveted world championship races. However, in spite of having a robust 749cc inline four-cylinder engine, the OW01 won races, but not championships. After ten long years of trying and failing, Yamaha finally decided to amp up their game and began work on the OW02. Months of trial and error later and the Yamaha YZF-R7 was ready to dominate the game.

The first package offered a power boost by utilising an unused bank of fuel injectors and retuning the ECU. This bumped up the R7’s power to 135 bhp. Soon after though, Yamaha offered another performance upgrade, worth around $12,000, which unleashed the full potential of the motorcycle. This included an almost total makeover, complete with titanium crankshafts in place of OEM ones.The motorcycle also had components which are still impressive and were miles ahead of its time. It was suspended by 43mm inverted telescopic forks and a piggyback monoshock at the rear. Both were from Ohlins and were fully adjustable. The frame also had an extra layer of aluminium, which provided extra torsional stiffness. This was almost twice that of the stiffness of the YZF-R1.That said, it was not easy for small teams or enthusiasts to bear the tuning expenses for the R7. To put that in perspective, there were only 500 units of the motorcycle manufactured for global distribution, more than two decades ago. So, finding out how the fully unleashed R7 would perform on the streets or the track has not only become impossible, it will be extremely expensive even if one manages to come across the bike and the kit.But the R7 was not to be spared by its share of problems. The expensive and difficult-to-repair crankshafts had a manufacturing defect which caused them to crack, thus carrying a fatal risk all along. However, Yamaha was quick to bounce back with a recall. After the issue of the cracked cranks was solved, Yamaha shifted their attention solely to winning the World Superbike Championship, as well as the Suzuka 8-hour endurance race. Yamaha was about to fulfil its dream onboard the R7 when an unfortunate tragedy struck.NoneNoriyuki Haga, the Japanese rider who was competing in the WSBK on behalf of the Yamaha racing team, had won most of the races in the 2000 WSBK season and looked poised to finally serve the R7’s purpose and bring the championship home. But a failed drug test caused the FIM to impose a month-long ban and strip Haga of all his points from the last two races. Luckily, his appeal to the authorities was heard after it was confirmed that the drugs found in his body were a natural derivative of an herb he consumed during the off-season. His race points from the South Africa round were reinstated and his ban was shortened to one week. In spite of this relief Haga still missed out on last race at Brands Hatch in Great Britain, indirectly helping Colin Edwards comfortably win the 2000 World Championship aboard his Honda VTR-1000.NoneThis dashed all hopes of Yamaha winning the championship, and the company disbanded its WSBK team soon after. This also caused the R7 to run out of time and opportunities, ultimately following its predecessor’s footsteps and failing to win a single championship in its short lifetime. Yamaha later rejoined the WSBK with the R1, but the era of the R7 was over, and Yamaha’s dream of winning the WSBK championship aboard the R7 remains incomplete to this day."

However, in light of the fact that the matter is sub-judice (reserved for the pronouncement of order) before the Regional Director, Northern Region, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, New Delhi, we are unable to comment on the issue with Quant at this point of time,"" said a Quantum AMC spokesperson.Sandeep Tandon, Founder of quant Group confirmed to have received the notice in February 2019. ""We have submitted our detailed response to the regional director's office and copies of the same have been sent to the board members of Quantum Asset Management Company Private Limited and Quantum Trustee Company Private Limited,"" he said.Tandon and two other senior mutual fund industry officials said that both parties put forth their arguments at the RoC recently.Quantum AMC commenced operations in March 2006 with the launch of its first scheme, Quantum Long Term Equity Value Fund. Quantum Advisors, the sponsor firm of Quantum AMC, was formed in 1990 and has been advising international clients and high networth individuals to invest in India.Tandon had founded quant group in 2007 and managed money for high networth families and family offices. In 2015, Tandon in his personal capacity acquired a small stake of 9 percent in the erstwhile Escorts Asset Management Ltd, a Delhi-based fund house. In December 2017, the Escorts Group decided to exit the Indian MF industry and Tandon's quant group took control of the fund house. It renamed the company quant Money Managers in February 2018 and received the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI's) final approval in June 2018.Further, Tandon said he owns and is the registered proprietor of the trademark ‘quant’ ""in relation to financial services, mutual funds, monetary services and allied services"".Quantum AMC has not yet registered its name with the trademark authorities.Nazneen Ichhaporia who is partner at ANB Legal and heads the intellectual property rights practice at the firm said: ""There could be an element of confusion. However, if ""quant"" is a registered trademark, then there’s not much that Quantum AMC can do. Besides, when someone applies for a trademark- as was the case with quant- the trademark authorities would have published the same in the Trade Marks Journal (available on the website of the authority), inviting objections from the general public. If nobody objected within a period of 90 days or the opposition is successfully resolved, only then the trademark gets registered. Post this, the applicant is legally entitled to use the registered trademark.""Two industry officials confirmed to Moneycontrol that SEBI has chosen to not intervene in the matter. When contacted CEO at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC and director on Association of Mutual Fund of India’s (Amfi) board A Balasubramanian said, ""The matter is between the two fund houses concerned. Amfi is an association of members; this is not an Amfi-related matter. It’s between the two fund houses and registrar of companies."""

description,Financial crises and allegations of dubious funding and muscling out competitors -- Naresh Goyal weathered it all. Nearly.
content,"Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal founder has agreed to step down as chairman. For someone who created and nurtured Jet Airways with so much passion, it is time for him to hand over the baton.Over the course of the past 25 years, Goyal has piloted Jet through several storms, financial and otherwise. He negotiated each of these thanks to his superb negotiating abilities.With Goyal's innings concluding, here's his back story.The journeyGoyal entered the travel business after starting a ticketing agency in the ‘80s. Fiercely ambitious, as India liberalized its economy, he set his eyes on the prize: he wanted to open the nation’s first private airlines.In this, he was beaten by Thakiyudeen Wahid, who launched East-West Airlines in 1992. Jet Airways commenced operations in 1993.A tumultuous relationship between the private rivals ensued, as both accused each of resorting to dubious practices and funding.East-West collapsed after Wahid was shot dead in 1995, with the airline succumbing to its debt, and ceasing all operations in 1996. The theory then was that Wahid was eliminated by gangster Chhota Rajan as his airline was funded by the rival D-Company.This cleared the path to dominate the budding airline industry. It became India's premier airlines, modelling itself after Singapore Airlines – with best-in-the-industry planes, food, livery etc.About 5 years later, Goyal himself came under the scanner over alleged links to Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel.NoneThe charges, however, weren’t a major setback for Goyal, who navigated the troubled waters thanks to his political connections, and despite a long-running feud with the then divestment minister Arun Shourie who called him the ""so-called owner"" of Jet Airways.NoneAround the same time, liquor baron Vijay Mallya's (now defunct) Kingfisher Airlines came into existence.To protect its position in the market, Jet acquired minor rival Air Sahara in a deal valued at $500 million, which later became low-cost sub-brand JetLite. The deal backfired as the complications of operating two airlines of completely different models, combined with high oil prices took a toll.The 2008 financial crisis proved particularly severe for Jet, with the company's market cap falling to a low of Rs 800 crore.NoneHe inked a code-sharing agreement with Etihad – that start of a relationship that would deepen later. In September 2012, Etihad picked up 24 percent in the carrier after the government liberalized its FDI policy.NoneThe beginning of the endEtihad's stake buy in Jet provided a breather to Jet but it did not realise that the market had now fully turned against it as low-cost carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir continued to acquire market share.Jet's debt burden continued to pile up between 2014 and 2017. The company went into a tailspin last year, as the impact of high oil prices and a depreciating rupee hit home.With not enough money left to pay staff salaries, Naresh Goyal faced a stark challenge. It needed to raise money through stake sales even as if that would mean his hold on the airline weakens.Reports said a round of discussions began with various parties, including Tatas, who made it clear they will be interested in buying a stake only if Naresh Goyal steps down.The last straw was when Etihad, which had backed Goyal previously, offered the same deal.Left with no choice, Goyal may have decided to step down, bloodied and weary from one battle too many fought over the course of 25 years.None"

title,Technical Classroom: How to use balance volume indicator for successful trading
datetime,2019-03-03 07:47:00+00:00
description,OBV or On Balance Volume indicator is used in technical analysis to measure buying and selling pressure.
content,"Shabbir KayyumiOBV or on balance volume indicator is used for technical analysis to measure buying and selling pressure.NoneWhat is an On Balance Volume (OBV)?The On Balance Volume Indicator is regarded by the industry as one of the most popular momentum and leading indicators, and is best used to detect new trading opportunities.Figure .1.Illustration of OBV IndicatorThe OBV is primarily traded on stocks as well as indices, commodities and Forex. It is a pure momentum oscillator, such as RSI, whereas pattern analysis can be combined with OBV to increase signal robustness.Construction of OBV IndicatorNoneFor example, a negative day with 10,00,000 volume is not as significant if the next up day has 50,00,000 in volume. The volume indicates buyers are very active in pushing the price up, and therefore OBV will move up over the two day period, even though one day was down and the other up.Working of OBV IndicatorFor traders, the value of OBV is not important, rather  it is the rate of change in OBV which is used to help generate trade ideas. If the OBV is moving notably in one direction, it could give credence to the idea that a big move could be coming in that direction in price.Figure .3. Working of OBV Indicator- When price continues to make lower troughs and OBV fails to make lower troughs, the downward trend is likely to stall or fail. This is called a positive divergence.The actual OBV value is not important, since the number can be huge, near zero, negative or positive. Therefore the right axis of the OBV indicator can be ignored; however direction and trajectory is important.Trading technique:Trading with divergence:Divergence occurs when the price movement is not confirmed by the indicator. In many cases, these divergences can indicate a potential reversal. Especially considering the premise behind the OBV indicator, which is positive and negative, volume swings precede changes in price.- If the OBV shows a divergence from price movement, a price reversal is imminent. For instance, if the price is rising, but the OBV starts to drop, a possible selling opportunity may exist.Trading with Trend line & EMABuying with OBVFigure.4 OBV Buy & Sell SignalsSelling with OBV- Negative Divergence will add better reversal; however it is not necessary.Traders should use the OBV in conjunction with other technical indicators to maximize their odds of success.Conclusion- OBV can also help forecast breakout directions in price.(The author is Head - Technical & Derivative Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors.)"

Parents have complained about the game’s addictive nature and even sought the game to be banned in the country.

This makes it one of the largest SUV to be on offer upon launch.2.       It has multiple engine optionsThe company has decided to offer the Hector in petrol and diesel variants. The petrol engine will be a 1.5-litre four-cylinder turbocharged unit, making 148BHP. The alternative is a 177BHP making 2-litre, four-cylinder diesel motor. The diesel unit is the same one used in Jeep Compass and Tata Harrier, albeit in a different state of tune.3.       It will be a fierce competitor"

In a bid to make the luxury SUV safer, Volvo has armed the XC90 with Oncoming Lane Mitigation, City Safety with Autobrake, and Cross Traffic Alert system.One of the essential updates it gets is the introduction of the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) which is picked straight out of Formula One. Volvo claims that this can help save up to 15 per cent in fuel efficiency. It will also reduce the vehicle’s carbon emissions. To differentiate the KERS equipped models, Volvo has branded a new B badge on the XC90. Volvo has limited the technology on B5 petrol and diesel, as well as B6 petrol engines. But it can be safe to expect that the technology will make its way to other models gradually."

Seeing the success of this move, LG shifted all their commercial air conditioning to being inverter-based with green gas.Khatwani said the emphasis is on four areas: noise reduction, sleeker size, energy-efficiency and environment friendliness.The current market for air conditioners in India is Rs 4,200-4,300 crore in terms of product sales in 2018. He added that Tier 3 and Tier 4 regions are seeing a faster rate of growth than the bigger towns because of a rise in aspirations. “The large cities are saturated.

That line, however, has been violated and kept on changing over the course of decades, with skirmishes, battles and full-fledged wars to show. In 1972, after the 1971 war with Pakistan, both countries signed the Simla Agreement.NoneIn 2003, India and Pakistan agreed to a formal ceasefire agreement and started ""confidence-building measures"" along the LoC and IB. According to a report by the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), increasing trade and contact between both the sides started in 2005, and cross-LoC trade in both sectors of Kashmir started in October 2008, only a month before the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.But if these agreements are in place, why do CFVs occur?Ceasefire violations are essentially cross-border shelling and firing along the LoC, IB and the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL).India has maintained that Pakistan has been indulging in violations for which the Indian side gives a response, but never violates ceasefire first.NoneNoneAccording to the Carnegie paper, women in Pakistan have protested against the practice, since it destroys their homes and livelihood. Moreover, the nearest human population in India lives about five miles away from the border, but in Pakistan, people reportedly live along the border, which enables more damage to their civilian population during the shelling.A 2017 RTI report showed that ceasefire violations occur almost daily along the border, and violations and casualties caused by them have increased over time.Have CFVs increased in the recent past?NoneThese violations were over four times the number of 2017, while by August 2017, the violations that year were as much as for entire 2016. This shows that CFVs have been increasing rapidly.The violations had decreased considerably after the 2003 agreement, reportedly after Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf turned the tap off on terrorist activities along the border. They have, however, spiked again in recent months.Does this spike, then, signal escalation?Not necessarily. For one thing, according to experts, the escalation after the Pulwama terror attack was done through air strikes, and although escalations might occur during CFVs, there are means through which both the sides resolve the issue.None"

title,Six steps to accumulate your first Rs 1 crore after you start working
datetime,2019-03-05 11:45:00+00:00
description,"Millennial should invest at least 30-50% monthly income. The rest should be utilised for monthly expenses, pay EMIs or credit card dues, etc"
content,"In 2017, Sarthak Langde (23), residing in Mumbai, graduated from college and shifted to Bengaluru with a job. At the time, he didn’t imagine his monthly expenses will be beyond his limit. While studying, his discretionary and lifestyle expenses were Rs 20,000-30,000 a month. However, during college days parents used to take care of his monthly allowance for expenses.NoneOften, millennials enjoy the greatest financial freedom as they start earning. Abhinav Angirish, founder of financial advisory firm, InvestOnline.in advised: “Millennials should start investing early as it gives an edge where you won’t need to rush or cut necessities to make provisions for the retirement.”NoneNoneOften millennial investors, want the highest amount of returns in the short term by taking larger risks while investing. For instance, Langde when he started working in 2017 was not keen to invest in mutual funds or other traditional instruments (fixed deposits, recurring deposits, etc.) and earn 7% to 12% compounding returns in the long term.So, he preferred investing in direct equities with monthly savings. He invested / traded in equities for nine months then exited from equity investments. Around the same time, bitcoins were in the bulletin for new highs on regular basis. So, he preferred investing in bitcoins and invested about Rs 70,000 after withdrawing from equities.When bitcoins price were at peak his investment value was Rs 4 lakh. In July 2018, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rolled out regulations for investors in bitcoins. As per RBI regulations, banks will terminate their existing relationships with firms or individuals dealing in cryptocurrency. This led to sharp correction in bitcoins price. At present, the value of his investment in bitcoins is Rs 12,000 (approximately). He learnt a lesson the hard way of investing in risky assets and registered losses.NoneSrikanth Meenakshi, Co-founder of online investment platform FundsIndia said, “On our platform, we have about 50,000 millennial investors (age category of 25 years and below) in a month. This is 25% of total investors on FundsIndia platform. They prefer to invest in risky mutual fund schemes for thrill but have low monthly investments (Rs 500 to Rs 1,000).”Repeatedly, these millennial investors prefer to invest in small cap and international funds expecting higher returns in the long run from their investments.It is advised to identify your risk appetite and short / long-term goals then align your investments. Millennial investors can start with passive funds and large-cap oriented schemes to begin with are a good option before you graduate to riskier options.NoneOften millennials are in dilemma when they start with investing from their monthly income after starting with first job. They are unaware where to invest, how much should go towards living expenses, short-term and long-term goals.For instance, Vasishta Guru 23, residing in Bengaluru couldn’t start investing from his savings in the first year of job (during the year 2017) due to lack of understanding of financial assets. He was not good at handling money during the first year of job. Often, he used to utilise the savings on discretionary expenses since no determine goal.However, in the year 2018 decided to appoint a financial advisor on advice of his colleague. His short-term goal is saving for higher education and long-term goal is retirement.Saurav Basu, Head of Wealth Management, Tata Capital Financial Services said, “Millennials should use the thumb rule – 50:20:30 wherein 50% of the income should go towards living expenses and spending (including outing, food, travel, etc.); 20% towards savings for your short-term goals or for liquidity purpose; and 30% towards long-term goals (like planning for kids, retirement; basically wealth creation).”When planning a financial goal, it is important to factor in inflation. For instance, if you decide to buy a car that costs Rs 5 lakh today after seven years, it will cost you Rs 8 lakh if 7% inflation is considered.NoneGuru was unclear of his goals and so ended up monthly savings in shopping, travelling, etc. He was able to save 50% of his monthly income but couldn’t utilise it in right channel for his goals and tax savings in the first year. To millennials like Guru who have just started working, a basic financial plan is recommended by Rohit Shah, founder and CEO of Mumbai-based financial advisory firm Getting You Rich.In basic financial plan, a millennial should first build emergency corpus equivalent to six months of average expenses. This should include your EMIs (if any), insurance premium, utility bills and other recurring household and living expenses. Then make sure your risk management is covered which means having term life insurance plan (if have dependent parents and liability of any loans) and health insurance plan for yourself and dependent parents, followed by investing to minimise tax liability and lastly invest towards short term and long term goals.NoneMillennial investors lack financial discipline and often fail to increase their investments in sync with their rising income. To such investors a step-up investment strategy is recommended by financial advisors.A step-up investment strategy allows investors to increase their investment in sync with their expected growth of income. This helps investors in deriving greater benefit from the power of compounding, and thereby reach their financial goals sooner.Naveen Kukreja, CEO and Co-founder of online financial marketplace Paisabazaar.com said, “One of the best ways to implement step-up investment strategy is to opt for step-up SIPs. The automatic increase in the SIP amount at periodical intervals will ensure financial discipline and regular investing.”NoneA lot of investors get scared by a sudden market drop and redeem or stop investing in their mutual funds. Prateek Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of online financial advisory firm, Upwardly.in said, “Don’t give up on SIP investments in a bear phase. A volatile market can award you with investment opportunities that you shouldn’t miss. Riding the bear phase while continuing your SIP/ investments, is the only way to make large gains in the equity markets.”NoneEducational loan is a hefty burden for most of the millennials when they start working after graduation. Repaying education loan chews most of the savings for millennials. To pay out the debt, one must consider cutting down his/her daily expenses, and the saving could be invested. The payment of the EMI should be automated and selected to be nearest to the salary credit date. This would enable them, not to overdue their payments.Angirish said, “To reduce education loan burden the millennials may use the option of second source income. This will end up leaving some extra money in your pocket. These can be used to pay your educational loan.” You should consider paying off of the loan at the earliest with annual bonus from employer, any one-time income and other investments.NoneAjit Singh, 40, residing in Pune delayed investing for his retirement goal by giving priority to buying a house and travel goals (international vacations). He is planning to retire at the age of 60. So, now he is just left with only 20 years to save for retirement goal. Based on his average monthly expenses he requires a corpus of Rs 3.5 crore at retirement. Basu explained, “When one starts saving early, the magic of compounding helps. Most of us are unable to measure the true cost of delayed savings.”For instance, if Ajit Singh now saves Rs 10,000 per month for 20 years his investments will grow to approx. Rs 1 crore (assuming a 12% compounded returns). This corpus amount is much lower than his requirement. However, if he would had started investing same amount at the age of 30 (10 years earlier than now), the accumulated amount would be closer to Rs 3.5 crore (assuming a 12% compounded returns). The difference of Rs 2.5 crore is a huge amount; a 10-year head start can make!"

title,Explainer | Why you should focus on residual maturity of fixed income investments
datetime,2019-04-26 14:49:00+00:00
description,Residual maturity is the time pending for the bond’s maturity.
content,"Bond investments generally come with clearly defined time-frame. Though some bonds are listed and traded in secondary market, in most cases, you have to be prepared to hold on to your investments till maturity. That makes many individuals to frown at the idea of investing in long-term fixed income investments, including bonds, public provident fund (PPF) and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY).However, not many really understand that one should be more focussed on the residual maturity of a bond and not the tenure of the bond. Residual maturity is the time pending for the bond’s maturity. If the bond is issued for 10 years, then after two years from issuance, the residual maturity is eight years.Ask an average investor about investing in tax-free bonds issued by central government backed public sector undertakings (PSUs) some years ago, and the first thing you hear is long term – 10,15 or 20 years. But they forget that these bonds were issued in the year 2013. So the residual maturity of some of these bonds would be around five, six or seven years; the number of years remaining for maturity.These bonds are issued by National Thermal Power Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, Housing and Urban Development Corporation, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Indian Railway Finance Corporation. Given the prevailing tax-free yield in the range of 6-7%, these bonds could be considered by individuals who are looking to invest for five years and want to earn tax-free returns.PPF and SSY are also considered as long-term investments. Tenure of PPF is 15 years and SSY money can be withdrawn after the girl child attains the age of 18 and 21. But there is a way to take advantage of these options. For example, in the early years of career, one may find it difficult to save big money. But still an account can be opened in PPF. In the initial years, one may start with token investments. As one grows in his/her career, he can increase his investments.In the last few years, you can invest larger sums in PPF account and can be used as 3-year, 4-year or 5-year instrument that offers tax-free returns with sovereign guarantee.Same can be done with SSY and EPF. In case of EPF, individuals nearing their retirement can consider an increase in their voluntary contribution to EPF up to 100% of basic salary. We are not suggesting that you invest your entire (basic) salary in voluntary EPF as money is locked in till you retire, but a little bit extra on your part can help boost the retirement corpus without taking extra risk. Besides, you need to keep an eye on your asset allocation as well."

content,"Gone are the days when only women visited salons for all the pampering. Men are also warming up to grooming services. This has led to a boom in the grooming market in India and even international brands are benefiting from this opportunity. One such brand is Truefitt & Hill. Considered as the oldest salon in the world, which has also been grooming the British royal family for more than 100 years, the company came to India in 2014. Since then, it has grown from one store to 19 in a span of five years thanks to the thriving male grooming market in India. None""That is why Truefitt & Hill has its presence in the most premium locations at each city,"" said Ansari in an interview to Moneycontrol.Spread across 11 cities, T&H has barber shops in Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad and Mumbai among others.""There are six stores under construction which will take the total number of stores in India to 25,"" said Joanna Broughton, executive director, Truefitt & Hill global.She also said, “The growth of the Indian market is simply dictated by demand and also because we are the only company in the country that provides this level of service and expertise of over two centuries of experience and two centuries of skills.”Grooming marketAccording to a Nielsen 2017 report, 'confidence' and 'achieving a competitive edge over other males in their profession' are two key drivers which have led to a surge in the adoption of male grooming products.A different study on India’s male grooming market says that the adoption of western culture, increased disposable income, elevated standard of living, and urbanization is contributing to the growth of this industry.The report observed that Indian men shell out a significant part of their salaries as a disposable amount for their grooming sessions in spas and salons.According to a 2017 Assocham report, men’s grooming market in India has grown more than 42 percent over the last five years“If you look at the wellness space, it is growing 30-40 percent year-on-year. If you look at industry and store level growth, the latter varies between 8 to 15 percent. So this is a sunrise industry; it will grow at the same rate for the next 8-10 years,” said Ansari.Private labelAnsari claims that the barbershop derives 25-35 percent revenue from its products, the highest in the industry today. He added that a typical unisex salon will grow around 8-15 percent from product revenue.“One of the reasons our product sales is also high is because 80 percent of the product for the use of consumer services is Truefitt & Hill products. We are already using the products in the services. The tendency of picking it up from the shelves is higher. Truefitt & Hill products are very addictive and also these products are there for a long time,” he said.  He added, “As far as the product usage is concerned, at least 50 percent of our regular clients indulge in trying out Truefitt & Hill products. On an average, each regular member buys at least 5-6 products in a year, which has gone up in the last four years. This reflects on our revenue also.”The company's signature services starts from Rs 1,800, which go up to Rs 2,200. Besides, hair cuts can go up to Rs 1,500."

description,These Apex Legends weapons can ensure you stay on top of the game
content,"Apex Legends is fast emerging as one of the most popular shooters in 2019. This fast-paced battle royale takes a ton of cues from games like PUBG, Fortnite and Overwatch. Once you select a character you are thrust into the game, and once you get past the initial phase, you’ll have a plethora of weapon choices, and that doesn’t include weapon attachments. Ammo in the game is also further divided into four categories – Energy Ammo, Heavy Ammo, Shotgun Ammo and Light Ammo (Arranged in order of rarity with Energy Ammo being the rarest and Light Ammo being the most common).Weapons in Apex Legends are divided into different categories including assault rifles, submachine guns, light machine guns, pistols, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Let’s take a look at the best weapons in the game, so you know what to pick as soon as you land:Undoubtedly the best gun in the game, the R-301 has almost no recoil and a high fire rate. The weapon excels at both mid and long-range firefights.The Havoc is the most recent addition to the Apex Legends’ arsenal. Although the Havoc takes a couple of seconds to charge, once charged the high fire rate could burst down an enemy in a single magazine. The Turbo Charger attachment eliminates charge time on the Havoc.The Wingman is not easy to master, but once you do get the hang of it, you’ll notice it's pretty overpowered. The Wingman is ideal for all combat scenarios. This weapon doesn’t have a particularly good fire rate, but a single clip with six bullets can be more than enough to drop an opponent if used correctly.The Peacekeeper is a pretty common weapon, and you can kill an opponent without armour in one shot at close range with it. When paired with a Precision Choke Hop-Up, you’ll be able to hold down the aim button to charge your shot, allowing for a much closer spread and more lethal damage. The Peacekeeper is a powerful early game weapon that can give you a considerable advantage over an opponent.With an accuracy and fire rate that's hard to match, the M600 Spitfire is one of the best guns in the game. The initial 35 magazine capacity can be increased to 55 bullets with an Epic Heavy Mag extension.The R-99 can fire up to 1060 rounds per minute, giving it the highest damage per second figures in the entire game. The R-99’s blistering fire rate allows you to pop into a fight, unload your magazine and jump back into combat. You want to get a Light Mag extension on the R-99 as soon as possible because of its 18-bullet magazine capacity."

For example, India made it clear that dairy products must be derived from animals that have never consumed any feed containing organs, blood or tissues of ruminant origin. Therefore, unconditional access to the dairy market is not entirely possible in India on religious grounds.India was willing to cut tariffs on ICT products, where there was a direct US interest.

description,"The car has been made entirely in carbon-fibre, without using a single steel component."
content,"British hypercar maker Aston Martin has revealed the specifications of its latest model, the Valkyrie. While it is one of the most modern cars in the Aston Martin lineup, it is also the closest to owning a Formula One car that money can buy.Developed with Red Bull Racing and Cosworth, two of the most reputed racing divisions in Formula One, the Valkyrie is a naturally aspirated monster, making a total of 1160 BHP, combined with its electrical hybrid engine. The 6.5-litre V12 has a redline of 11000 rpm and can spit a peak torque of more than 740 Nm.Another of its unique differentiators is its build quality. The car has been made entirely in carbon-fibre, without using a single steel component. This helps the car achieve a 1:1 power-to-weight ratio. Its aerodynamic exterior and an open underfloor are designed to maximise downforce while harnessing the atmosphere around the Valkyrie.The Valkyrie aims to dethrone the Mclaren P1 as the closest street-production car to a race-spec Formula One car. It leaves no stone unturned and even features an F1-esque steering wheel to complete the effect.Aston Martin claims that the Valkyrie is its first true hypercar and will be limiting the production to 150 units only. The car is expected to make its appearance at the Geneva Motor Show."

Our intention is to defeat the BJP-AIADMK combine in Tamil Nadu and there is no difference of opinion in that (among constituents),"" the Left leader said.On the participation of the CPI(M) in rallies by Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the state, Balakrishnan indicated they would attend them.The DMK, in its bid to lead a rainbow alliance, has already signed electoral arrangements with the Congress, Communist Party of India (CPI), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi (IJK), Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML).It is continuing talks with the Vaiko-led Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK). There are a total of 39 Lok Sabha seats in the state, besides one in neighbouring Puducherry.Asked about the party's stand on bypolls to 21 Assembly seats that have been lying vacant in the state, Balakrishnan said it had already been decided that the CPI(M) would support the DMK.While 18 seats are lying vacant following the court upholding the disqualification of AIADMK MLAs for revolting against the chief minister in 2017, Tiruvarur and Tirupparankundram segments await bypolls due to the death of sitting legislators, former DMK chief M Karunanidhi and AK Bose of AIADMK, respectively."

content,"In an attempt to reach out to the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) Central Committee has announced that it would not contest from the six parliamentary seats in West Bengal that are currently held by either of the two parties.NoneWest Bengal has a total of 42 parliamentary constituencies, out of which the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) had won 34 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress had won four and the CPI(M) had gotten a dismal two.Sources have told the newspaper that Gandhi is “trying to convince” his party’s state unit on a seat-sharing agreement, adding that the Congress wants to contest from the two CPI(M) seats as well.A seat-sharing agreement between the CPI(M) and its erstwhile rival Congress is crucial in West Bengal to take on the dominant TMC and the rising BJP in the state, where the Left was in power for 34 long years.The concretization of a partnership between the Congress and the CPI(M) is also important for Yechury, who has fought with the Kerala unit of the party to convince them to keep their doors open for an alliance with the Grand Old Party in West Bengal.A senior leader from the CPI(M) told the newspaper that the party has conveyed its wish to contest from at least 20 seats to the Congress. Its three partners — CPI, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) and Forward Bloc — may get 9 seats. The rest, 13, will be Congress’ share.During the United Opposition meeting, Yechury is said to have spoken to both UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi over the formation of an alliance. To this, Rahul is said to have agreed on the importance of an alliance but also pointed out the need for Congress to contest from more number of seats.When asked about CPI(M)’s readiness to form an alliance with an erstwhile adversary, Sitaram Yechury told the newspaper, “The situation has changed. We decide tactics on based on current situation.”"

content,"The rise of militancy followed by the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s silenced the bustle that characterised a temple located in Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Thirty years later, efforts of resident Muslims may ensure that the temple bells chime once again to enthrall the sole Hindu family residing in the neighbourhood.The 80-year-old temple is located in Achan village, and 40 Kashmiri Pandit families would frequent it in its heydays. It is situated barely 15 km away from the site of the JeM fidayeen attack on CRPF men that shook the nation. Though the recent tension between India and Pakistan and the attacks on Kashmiris across the country did disrupt the restoration work for a few days, it resumed on Maha Shivratri.A masjid is located just adjacent to the temple and the locals say they wish to hear the temple bells ring along with calls of Azaan, just like it would in the past.NoneThe locals informed NDTV that restoration work began after the sole Pandit family residing there approached the Masjid Auqaf Committee to help restore the temple, which was in a sorry state.NoneHis brother Sanjay Kumar adds, their Muslim neighbours are now closer to them than their kin who fled the village decades ago.He adds, not only are they helping in restoring the temple to its former glory, they have also stood by them even in the most troubled of times. “We live here like brothers,” he states.Mohammad Yunus, a local, hopes his Hindu neighbours would return to their roots some day. He says: “I wish we could relive the old days. I appeal to our Pandit brothers and sisters to come back to the village.”Yunus also fondly recalled how as a child he would rush to the temple in the evening where an old priest would give him sweets, dry fruits, and jaggery."

title,Comment | Gadkari’s urine-to-urea idea is no laughing matter
datetime,2019-03-06 09:52:00+00:00
description,We could use the urine storage idea to fix our sewage systems
content,"Shishir AsthanaAddressing a gathering of young innovators at the Mayor Innovation Awards function of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that if all the urine we produce is collected, enough urea can be produced and we can stop importing urea for our farming needs.Human and animal wastes have been used as fertilisers in India and the world over for a very long time. However, the question that Gadkari has raised is the commercial use of urine as urea.Before answering that, we need to hold our noses and  take a deep dive into urine, to see if there is more to it than just the elimination of waste. Simply put, is there money at the bottom of the chamber pot?For starters, any urine report will show you that it contains 95 percent water and 3 percent salts such as potassium, calcium, ammonia, sodium, phosphate etc. The remaining 2 percent is urea, which is a proxy for delivering nitrogen to the soil. In essence, urine has all the salts that chemical fertilisers deliver – NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium).The water in urine acts as a good delivery mechanism for providing the plants with the fertiliser. Researchers have found that nutrients in urine are in just the right form for plants to drink.The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry has published the works of environmental scientists Surendra Pradhan and Heli Heinonen-Tanski of the University of Kuopio, Finland, who have studied the application of urine. According to the report the scientists planted four plots of beets and treated one with mineral fertilizer, one with urine and wood ash, one solely with urine, and one with no fertilizer, as a control.After 84 days, about 280 beets were harvested. The beetroots from the urine- and urine/ash–fertilized plants were found to be 10 percent and 27 percent larger by mass, respectively, than those grown in mineral fertilizer. By subjecting some of the beets to chemical analysis, the researchers determined that all of them had comparable nutrient contents—and according to a blind taste-testing panel, their beety taste was indistinguishable.Gadkari is therefore absolutely right about urine. The scientists mentioned above say that it is totally possible to use human urine as a fertilizer instead of industrial fertilizer.Why then has the world not moved to use urine, available freely in copious quantities, rather than depend on chemically produced urea? The problem lies with the collection of urine.Urine is sterile when it leaves our body but it starts to putrefy when exposed to air and breaks down into ammonia and carbon dioxide which are mainly responsible for the odour. This also causes various complications when they are transported through pipes.Sweden, which has taken the lead in using urine, had to rework its entire sewage system by using porcelain in certain areas. But scaling it up and getting it to industrial scale is a very costly exercise that even environmentally conscious rich Scandinavian nations have not done.A back of the envelope calculation shows that in order to fulfil Gadkari’s dream India will have to urinate 300 million tonnes to produce 6 million tonnes of urea a year (2 percent of urine by volume), which is the amount of urea India imports. India with its enormous population has a competitive advantage in urine production. We urinate more than what is needed to satisfy our urea needs, but the problem is in diverting it to the farms safely. International experiments in using urine have worked in limited areas.What then should be our policy on urine? Or as Hamlet would probably have said, ‘To pee or not to pee, that is the question.’Rather than storing urine at airports, which Gadkari has asked his team to do, setting up sewage systems in towns and villages near farms will be far more useful. In any case the villages and smaller towns have pre-historic sewage systems, they surely can do with a new one, which will have urine collection as a bonus."

content,"NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneHe explained that Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films are bigger “because of a large number of consumers of content in these languages overseas"". Elaborating on this, Pillai said, ""The overseas market is for content in these languages is huge because the Telugu film industry is as big as Bollywood in America. This is because more number of Telugu people are there. Similarly,  Tamil has huge market mainly because of Sri Lankan Tamils who have grown up watching Tamil films and who have migrated to the US or Canada and their population is huge there.”“Kannada has got a market only in the US. Tamil has the biggest overseas market because it is spread evenly across the globe. Then comes Telugu because it has got a very big audience in the US. People who migrated from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the two Telugu-speaking states, have created an opening there,” Pillai added.He also pointed out that “ticket rates of Telugu films are higher in the US – while the ticket of a Hindi film costs $10-$12, a ticket for a Telugu film is for $20”.NoneHe had said that even though the success rate of Kannada films is less but the industry should keep focusing on making good films.The industry, which churns around 300 films every year, does not have a big market. Pillai believes that the only way forward for the industry is to make it big globally.He also pointed out that “regional content (Kannada films) in Karnataka is only one-state-driven while other regional cinema has travelled to Mumbai, Delhi and other cities”.""There is a huge market for content in alternate languages – for instance in Hyderabad for Tamil films; Malayalam cinema is now popular all over in multiplexes in Gujarat. However, Kannada hasn’t grown like that. For the  Kannada industry, 95-98 percent revenue comes from within the state. This is different for Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films, where 70-80 percent revenue comes from within the state and the rest is outside,” Pillai explained.Pillai said that while Kannada films are big in markets like Hubli, Dharwad and Shimoga (Shivamogga), the real big deal is Bengaluru because of the presence of multiplexes. “PVR alone has the highest earnings coming from Bengaluru, where they have 25-28 multiplexes,” he said.However, he said that Kannada films in Bengaluru are getting swamped by Hindi cinema and to a certain extent Tamil and Telugu cinema. ""Telugu has a bigger market because Andhra Pradesh shares its border with Karnataka. So, first I would say the Khan films followed by Telugu and Tamil,” Pillai said.This is probably the reason that of the 230 films that the Kannada film industry produced last year, only 20 could stand out in terms of business at the box office.According to a 2017 report, the contribution of the Kannada film industry to the overall box office share is 2 percent of the revenues and box office success rate stands at around 25 percent.NoneWhile industry players have suggested a number of solutions – like the state government should promote Kannada films outside Karnataka, it should increase the subsidy for Kannada movies, etc – Pillai said that the industry should just concentrate on making good films.While the industry is in a transitory phase and witnesses many half-baked attempts, a member of the film industry suggested regulating the number of releases. This will then give more screen space to good films which now get lost in the crowd.The industry is also warming up to the idea of joining the library of over the top (OTT) platforms that are aggressively looking at expanding their regional content. This could increase interest amid viewers for Kannada films."

description,The group’s non-banking finance company (NBFC) arm in India was to be called Sharekhan BNP Paribas Financial Services
content,"French banking group BNP Paribas' NBFC plans in India may have fallen prey to the present crisis ailing the industry.BNP Paribas, which acquired Sharekhan broking house in 2016, was looking to expand its lending business through the latter's non-banking finance company.The company even secured a license for starting the NBFC and hired over 100 employees. The NBFC arm was to be called Sharekhan BNP Paribas Financial Services and was set to be launched in December.But tables turned after the liquidity crisis hit the NBFC sector triggered by IL&FS default. The French banking group, according to three industry sources, has not just deferred the launch but is also looking to sell its NBFC license.And if the market grapevine is to be believed, BNP Paribas has been unable to find a buyer and may end up surrendering the NBFC license.The setback is symbolic of the larger crisis of confidence in the NBFC industry. The IL&FS default had triggered a mini-collapse in the market, and credibility of rating agencies took a beating.None""We are constantly exploring new solutions that will deliver benefits to our Sharekhan clients as part of our ongoing sustainable commitment to the Indian market. New products and services are only launched when we believe they are in the best interests of our clients and may be supported sustainably over time by our Group,"" the company said in its response.The acquisition, and the troubleSharekhan Financial Services was a wholly-owned finance company of broking firm Sharekhan acquired by BNP two years ago. Sharekhan Financial offers margin funding, loan against shares and ESOP funding to clients and rich individuals.After BNP acquired Sharekhan, the French bank group wanted to tap Sharekhan’s network and expand the lending business.But the plan soured when the first signs of trouble in the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) group emerged in June when it defaulted on inter-corporate deposits and commercial papers (borrowings) worth around Rs 450 crore. Over the next 2-3 months, at least two rating agencies downgraded the company's long-term credit rating.IL&FS Financial Services defaulted on seven debt obligations in September. In all, the IL&FS group owed over Rs 91,000 crore.Somewhere down the road, NBFCs started getting compared with IL&FS, and their financials were put under deep scanners.A few debt fund managers started abandoning NBFC papers in panic and rumours started flying thick and fast about NBFC facing default prospects.As of January-end, the 43-player mutual fund industry managed Rs 6.3 lakh crore of fixed income assets compared to 13.73 lakh crore in September. MFs held Rs 2,700 crore worth of IL&FS bonds and debt papers.The market was concerned that the bonds issued by other IL&FS subsidiaries like IL&FS Transportation, IL&FS Tamilnadu Power, IL&FS Energy Development and  IL&FS Security Services could be downgraded in the near future.On September 10, rating agencies ICRA and CARE downgraded non-convertible debentures of IL&FS to BB from AA+. ICRA and said the downgrade reflected ""rising pressure on liquidity at the group level due to sizeable repayment obligations"".ICRA also downgraded the short-term rating for a Rs 4,000 crore commercial paper programme of IL&FS Financial Services, a subsidiary of IL&FS, to 'A4' from 'A1+'.IL&FS Financial had informed exchanges the company would not be able to issue any commercial papers until February 28, as it had defaulted on payments on two papers, which were due to mature on August 28 and August 30.NBFCs funded developers by raising capital from banks and mutual funds. After defaults by IL&FS and the alarming sale of Rs 300 crore worth DHFL commercial papers at higher yields by DSP Mutual Fund, markets became wary of a possible NPA crisis in NBFCs as well.Banks reacted by tightening lending to NBFCs which in turn squeezed the lending capacity of NBFCs and therefore, impacted capital flow.One of the fallout of the crisis is now BNP Paribas' NBFC dream."

Narasimhan, 42, is a Harvard trained doctor.Under Narasimhan, a number of people from technology companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook were hired by Novartis to crunch data, identify additional and new insights out of these data sets and enable Novartis’ scientists to ask queries.To enable this R&D transformation, Plueckebaum’s team is trying to create a central repository of all R&D data into a single integrated system dating back to 20 years, or right from the day when Novartis started electronically capturing data. This isn’t an easy task.Plueckebaum in an interview to Moneycontrol at Hyderabad’s Novartis office said the major challenge they faced was to clean up the data as it was locked in domain-specific silos owned by different teams, displayed inconsistencies and was difficult to access.A petabyte is equivalent to a size of 20 million 4-door filing cabinets full of text or 58,292 high definition DVDs. Once the data is cleaned, Plueckebaum and his team will sweep through data to search for leads.“Humans just cannot go through it anymore, so you put machines on top that then start digging into the data. And obviously, you need to train the machines, you need to give the machines proper direction,” Plueckebaum said.Dropping R&D productivityThe R&D productivity of Big Pharma is expected to hit zero by 2020, which means every dollar spent on R&D gets just one dollar, and nothing more.Industry attributes this to ballooning R&D costs, higher R&D attrition, difficulty in enrolling patients for clinical trials, and pressure on companies from the government and activists to cut prices of drugs.It's early days, but even other drug makers are betting on data analytics and AI.For instance, Merck uses Hadoop to crunch huge amounts of data so it can develop vaccines faster. Amgen is using machine learning to better diagnose osteoporotic fractures."

content,"NoneNoneThis is the second partnership between Edelweiss and CDPQ after 2016 when CDPQ picked up 20 percent stake in Edelweiss's asset reconstruction company.Contours of the dealNon-banking finance company ECL Finance manages the group’s lending activities across wholesale and retail segments. The deal excludes the distressed credit and wealth management related credit books like loan against securities (ESOP funding and margin financing).NoneThe said transaction involves the asset/loan book of around Rs 30,000 crore as at end December. Wholesale lending constitutes almost 56 percent of this Rs 30,000 crore loan book and comprises mainly of real estate loans, a segment vulnerable to cyclical downturns.The amount will be invested by CDPQ in three tranches through convertible debentures to be compulsorily converted into equity. The first investment of $150 million would be immediately available on receiving the regulatory approvals. The remaining $100 million will be invested in two equal tranches at the end of the first and second years from the initial investment.The deal will strengthen the lender’s balance sheet The equity infusion will improve the capital adequacy and leveraging capability of ECL Finance. It will enable the lender to boost its retail lending business as well as take advantage of any market consolidation opportunities.We are particularly enthused by the fact that the lending business is drawing interest from global investors despite the business being adversely impacted by liquidity concerns currently.And boost investor confidenceECL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edelweiss group in September 2017 after the latter bought out the 7.8 percent stake held by GIC, Singapore.As per the management, CDPQ will end up owning between 13- 18 percent equity in ECL Finance on full conversion and depending on the conversion price. In effect, the deal values ECL Finance anywhere between Rs 10,000 – 14,000 crore.Edelweiss’ current market capitalisation is around Rs 15,300 crore. The stock has corrected more than 40 percent from its 52-week high since September 2018 when a liquidity crisis engulfed the NBFC sector. If the deal value with CDPQ is anything to go by, the upside to the stock can be meaningful.Simply put, the current market cap of the stock ascribes a very low value to the other businesses of Edelweiss if we go by the higher end of the estimated deal value for ECL Finance. This means investors are getting other non-lending businesses of the group almost free.Edelweiss group, that commenced operations as a capital market player, has incubated several business segments like distressed assets, insurance, and wealth and asset management in addition to credit business (wholesale and retail lending) over the past few years. The group has emerged as India’s third-largest wealth manager after Kotak Mahindra Bank and IIFL wealth.Edelweiss has fast evolved into a ‘bank-like’ structure with the lending business is facing sectoral headwinds such as high interest rates, reduced liquidity and vulnerable asset quality. However, there are multiple growth levers for the stock in the long term. The current deal will only strengthen investors’ confidence and prompt them to keep the stock on their radar."

description,"ABB India’s power grid business accounts for about 40 percent of its revenue and 30 percent of EBIT. It reported a sales turnover of Rs 4,222 crore and an EBIT of Rs 422 crore in CY18"
content,"NoneNoneThe reason behind this apprehension was that ABB is exiting the global power grid business at a valuation of one time its CY17 annual sales and 13 times earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), far lower than the Indian business, which is trading at 3.3 times CY18 estimated sales and 38 times EBIT. If the global benchmark is used, domestic investors would receive far lower proceeds than what is ascribed by the market.Thankfully, ABB India is now curving out this domestic transmission and distribution (T&D) business into a separate entity. Currently, promoters hold 75 percent in ABB India, while the rest is owned by the public. The demerged entity will mirror the existing shareholding of ABB India. After the demerger, existing promoter stake will go to Hitachi, whereas minority shareholders will be issued one share of the demerged entity for every five shares held in ABB India.As the management would seek to list this demerged company, the value will be determined by the market. While the rational for the swap ratio is still missing, the idea should be to maintain or create value for minority shareholders. The sum total of the shares after demerger should be equal to or higher compared to the current value of existing shares.ABB India’s power grid business accounts for about 40 percent of its revenue and 30 percent of EBIT. It reported a sales turnover of Rs 4,222 crore and an EBIT of Rs 422 crore in CY18.Investors will weigh both the companies separately. ABB India is currently valued at 40 times its CY19 estimated earnings. That is on a higher side and reflect its technological edge and product profile, which may not reflect in the case of power grid business. Thus, the power grid business may get a lower valuation multiple, which seems to be reflect in the swap ratio and which favours the remaining business. This also means that investors should not expect a cash payout or a one-time dividend as expected by most earlier.NoneFor more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page"

title,Women's Day 2019: Labour force participation of females is still an Achilles Heel for India
datetime,2019-03-08 12:26:00+00:00
description,Higher dropout rates in schools and discrimination in offices have led to low participation of women in organised workforce.
content,"Kavita Rao was attending a job interview for a position as data analyst at an IT-services firm in Bengaluru. One of the questions puzzled her. She was asked if she will be able to 'handle' pressures of the work since she recently got married. Rao wondered if her male friends were asked the same.In another part of India, Disha Basu was asked if she will be 'allowed' to work after 6 pm since her house was two hours away from her office in Purulia, West Bengal.These are some of the questions, and factors that have led to a drop in the percentage of women in the country's labour force, a sobering thought as the world celebrates Women's Day.The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) of females in India is among the lowest in the world. And this comes as no surprise. Human resource officials said that both organisational and societal factors play a role in the fewer number of women joining the workforce.NoneAccording to a 2018 World Bank report, the labour force participation rate (LFPR) among females in India was 26.97 LFPR female in 2018 in India. The world average stood at 48.47 percent in 2018.The rate for women has been falling since 2005, when it was at a high of 36.78 percent.Male versus femaleNumbers from NSSO collaborate.NoneCompared to 2011-12, the LFPR for females fell by around 8 percentage points to 23.3 percent in 2017-18, whereas the LFPR for males dipped by 4 percentage points to 75.8 percent in 2017-18.The 2017-18 report of the NSSO also said that the fall in the LFPR was far more in rural areas (from 67.7 percent to 58.7 percent) than in urban areas (from 49.3 percent to 47.6 percent).What caused the decline in rural areas?A direct link to the decline in the number of women in rural areas is also related to the number of girls dropping out of school, post puberty.Human resource officials add that non-availability of basic facilities like clean toilets and long commute dissuade parents in remote locations from sending their daughters to school once the girls attain puberty.In many areas, daughters are sent to girls' only schools after attaining puberty. These schools often have poor infrastructure and teaching facilities that impact their learning outcomes.A report by Pratham (Annual Status of Education Report-Rural) 2018 said that 13.5 percent women in the age group of 15-16 years are not enrolled in school. In states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, it is higher at 24.9 percent and 26.8 percent respectively.NoneThere is a subject-wise difference as well. The ASER report said that for the age group 14 to 16 years, the all India figure for the proportion of girls who can read at least an Std II level text is very similar to that of boys, at 77 percent.However, the report said that in basic arithmetic, boys seem to hold a substantial advantage. Nationally, 50 percent of all boys in the age group 14 to 16 years can correctly solve a division problem, as compared to 44 percent of all girls.Then there is the lack of jobs for women in rural areas too, resulting in a lesser number of them being part of the formal workforce.Saundarya Rajesh, founder of Avtar Group, a diversity and inclusion consulting company said that there are more women in rural areas who are graduating and end up being over qualified for the kind of jobs that are available.""There is a dearth of formal sector jobs in rural India. Apart from government initiatives like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which guarantees 100 days of paid labour on public works projects per year, other formal jobs usually employ men,"" she added.Rajesh also explained that most salaried jobs are in the cities, towns and big villages. Hence, availability of transport and allied infrastructure has an impact on women's participation in the workforce, more so in the rural areas.Some inroadsNoneTata Motors has set up skill development centres across all plant locations, where it targets 50 percent to be women primarily from rural/small towns/economically-deprived areas. The pilot batch that the company started last year had 70 percent women.Similarly, the automotive firm has a state-approved apprenticeship programme under the Swarn Jayanti Rozgar Yojana and saw 200 women being hired. The duration was three years, during which the women received industrial training and appeared for an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) examination at the end of each year. Upon completion of their term, the women received state approved ITI certification and an on-job training certificate by Yamaha.Corporate biases?In urban areas, pre-conceived notions and biases have led to women either choosing to stay at home, or dropping-out of the workplace after a while.Catalyst, which is a global non-profit firm working on women's inclusion in the workplace, said that Indian women face a complex set of socio-cultural challenges.None""These include social expectations and stereotypes about gender roles, the complicated clashes between modernisation and tradition, and the impact of globalisation. There is an absence of reliable infrastructure outside of work, including daycare or transportation options,"" as per a report by Catalyst.Apart from issues around maternity benefits, the pay gap is also a clear factor that exists. The Monster Salary Index released this week said that Indian women earn 19 percent less than men.Here, the median gross hourly salary for men in India in 2018 stood at Rs 242.49, while for women it stood at around Rs 196.3. Even though sectors like IT/ITeS employ a higher number of women, there is a 26 percent pay gap between men and women.NoneKamal Karanth, co-founder of staffing firm Xpheno said that apart from the societal factors in play, some subconscious biases at the workplaces also had a role to play when it came to women's participation in the workplace.""The questions asked to a woman are different than what is asked to a man even in job interviews. A man will be judged based on his professional qualifications while there will be conversations around the likelihood of marriage and pregnancy in a prospective female candidate,"" he added.Flexi-working is also a facility offered by companies on paper. But when it comes to implementation, it is not uniform. Rajesh said that flexibility is at the core of the labour force participation rate of women in the country and that this should be taken seriously.NoneSectors-based biases also exist. For instance, manufacturing firms traditionally employ men in large numbers. HR consultants said that even if a woman is eligible, these companies would not hire them.""For a large engineering services firm in Odisha, we had recommended three women who were qualified for the position. But the company specifically asked for men saying that the job will be 'physically demanding',"" said a New Delhi-based head of a large staffing company.Maternity Act and related issuesEarlier, the law allowed three months or 12 weeks of maternity leave which has now been extended to 26 weeks as per the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill, 2016. This new law will apply to all establishments having 10 or more employees and will be applicable only for the first two children.For smaller companies, the real challenge according to HR consultants is keeping the number of women constant.""SMEs have expressed displeasure with the 26 weeks maternity leave. This will mean that these firms will avoid hiring women which will further impact labour force participation,"" added a staffing firm CEO.The Catalyst report said that nearly half of surveyed companies (48 percent) reported not offering any family care options such as on-site/near-site child care, emergency child care, referral and support services for child and elder care.""Such a lack of organisational support for post-leave caregiving responsibilities raises questions about the extent to which India Inc is fully supporting women's ability to successfully integrate work-life needs,"" it said.BottomlineAccording to a 2017 World Bank report, less than a third (27 percent) of women who are 15 years or older are working or actively looking for a job. Three of every five prime working age Indian women (26-45 years) are not economically active, meaning that these individuals are neither working on a farm or in businesses nor are they earning any wage.Only few countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia rank lower than India, which is an outlier with far lower female LFPRs compared to most countries at the same level of income.A Deloitte report on empowering women released on March 7 said that empowering girls and women through targeted education and reskilling interventions, combined with reframing societal constraints, can potentially accelerate their learning and enhance their skill sets."

description,Banks and insurers underestimated the magnitude of the digital transformation challenge.
content,"A new report by the Capgemini Research Institute has found that financial services firms are lagging behind in digital transformation compared to other industry sectors.  Financial services firms report falling confidence in their digital capabilities, and a shortage of the skills, leadership and collective vision needed to shape the digital future.The report, part of Capgemini’s Global Digital Mastery Series, examines sentiment on digital and leadership capabilities among bank and insurance executives, comparing it to an equivalent study from 2012. Over 360 executives were surveyed from 213 companies whose combined 2017 revenue represents approximately $1.67 trillion.Key findings include:Confidence in digital and leadership capabilities has sunk since 2012-Compared to 2012, a smaller proportion of financial services executives said their organizations had the necessary digital capabilities to succeed – with the confident few falling from 41 percent to 37 percent. Breaking this down, although more executives felt they had the required digital capabilities in customer experience (40 percent compared to 35 percent), confidence in operations saw a significant drop. Only 33 percent of executives said they had the necessary operations capabilities, compared to 46 percent from six years ago.NoneIn Capgemini’s digital mastery framework presented in the report, just 31 percent of banks and 27 percent of insurers are deemed to be digital masters, while 50 percent and 56 percent respectively are classified as beginners.Executives also criticized the lack of a compelling vision for digital transformation across their organizations. Only 34 percent of banking and 24 percent of insurance respondents agreed with the statement that ‘our digital transformation vision crosses internal organizational units’, with just 40 percent and 26 percent respectively saying that ‘there is a high-level roadmap for digital transformation’.Banking transformation has taken center stage, while insurance places focus on automation-Although banks’ digital transformation journeys are well underway, the industry has reached a crossroads, cites the report, as it attempts to meet the rising digital expectations of customers, manage cost pressures, and compete with technology upstarts. Fewer than half of banks (38 percent) say they have the necessary digital and leadership capabilities required for transformation. Insurance is catching-up with only 30 percent claiming to have the digital capabilities required and 28 percent the leadership capabilities necessary."

If there is one thing that the past five years has showed, it is that personal attacks on Modi do not stick — on the contrary, they often help the BJP.NoneFrom 2013 great care has been taken to cultivate the image of Modi as a development crusader and a leader who does not tolerate corruption. Slogans such as ‘Na khaunga, na khane dunga’ have added an aura that mesmerises the ‘aam aadmi’. It must not be forgotten that it was Modi’s personal capital that helped him and the government sail smoothly through the doldrums of demonetisation. If people were ready to suffer through it, it was because they believed in Modi’s personal integrity as a leader. By dexterously focusing on the Rafale deal and alleging that corruption has taken place in the deal, Rahul Gandhi has managed to dent that image to a small extent. However, the Balakot attack and the BJP’s use of it in speeches by its leaders seems to have overcome that.The Opposition must be willing to learn from its past mistakes, and not repeat them if it wants to mount a credible challenge to the BJP in the forthcoming polls.None"

Authorities are planning to build boundary walls of up to 10 feet to prevent stray cows and bulls from entering the park.Ajit Uchoi, Bharatpur deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) said that the menace caused by stray cattle is a growing issue. ""I have submitted a project estimate of Rs 3-5 crore for raising the height of the park's boundary wall. The current height of the boundary wall is 7 feet, but there are several places where it is very low because of the undulating landscape. These are the spots through which villagers bring in the animals,"" he added.These animals also pose a safety threat to hundreds of tourists that use the roads in the part for a commute via hired bicycles and rickshaws. The annual footfall in the park is nearly 1.5-2 lakh.The national park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Three years before this, the government had banned grazing practices in the area. Aghapur, Mallah, Jatoli and Barso are the nearby villages from where cattle are brought in on trucks and let loose in the middle of the forest.Authorities of the park have transferred nearly 200 animals from the protected forest area to ravines around Chambal nearly 100 km away.

While manually washing dishes could consume around 60-70 litres of water, a dishwasher uses 10 litres of water for a full cycle.Decoding other myths around the usage of dishwashers, Gunjan Srivastava, MD and CEO, BSH Household Appliances said that one full cycle of one full load in a dishwasher consumes one unit of electricity.The company sells dishwashers in the price range of Rs 27,000 to Rs 48,000.Talking about the hygiene concerns around dishwashers, Gunjan said that the dishwashers BSH offers use water that is heated up to 70 degrees. In addition, there are programs installed in the machine that takes care of the quality of water that is being used.While Bosch has a lot to offer, the penetration of dishwashers in the Indian market remains low.

title,"Amid tough times, private hospitals face shortage of CEOs"

description,"The rapid expansion of private healthcare facilities over last one decade,  has not just created shortage of specialist doctors but qualified senior administrators to manage them."
content,"KIMS Hospitals, one of India's largest hospital chain from Hyderabad led by leading Cardio-thoracic Surgeon Dr Bollineni Bhaskar Rao, is on the hunt for a Chief Executive Officer to run the operations.Under Rao's stewardship, KIMS has grown from a single hospital to a chain of multispecialty hospitals with 3,000 beds capacity, both organically and through strategic acquisitions.The expansion was fuelled by liberal dollops of private equity money, which Rao raised to expand the hospital chain.Rao wears several hats. If he is not in the operation theatre performing bypass surgery, he will be busy overseeing administrative and financial matters of the company as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.But Rao says managing large hospital network is becoming increasingly challenging.""Healthcare industry is going through a difficult phase, we are trying to optimise costs, increase volumes, reduce patients stay in the hospital, restructuring procurement, and even possibly looking at reducing the number of doctors and nurses,"" said Rao to Moneycontrol.But to do this difficult surgery at the organisation level, Rao needs one more hand, a CEO. It is turning out to be a difficult search.The rapid expansion of private healthcare facilities over the last one decade  has not just created a shortage of specialist doctors but qualified senior administrators to manage them.Limited pool of senior managersNone""In healthcare, there is a shortage of professionals. And typically professionals who were brought from other industries, but now healthcare is becoming very complex with its own nuances, clearly as much as we say clinical shortage, I think equally there is a shortage of administrators. It is more acute at a CEO level, but it is also there right up to the manager level,"" Mehta says.A channel check with headhunters by Moneycontrol confirms this.Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services says the shortage of CEOs is due to the rise in the number of hospitals in the country that has widened the supply-demand gap.“Hospitals usually want medical practitioners with some level of administrative experience to be part of the management team and such people are not easy to find. This is especially true after the sudden boom in the number of new hospitals coming up. Further, those who are well qualified for the role have ambitions to go abroad. Shortage of senior professionals in the medical sector is a reality across the globe and skilled Indians are also choosing to move to international locations if they have the requisite skills,” he says.The bigger challenge, according to HR professionals, is also that medical professionals are now not just employable in hospitals, but also other sectors like insurance and e-commerce firms.“The options of employment are much wider and an individual who would otherwise be paid Rs 50 lakh per annum in a hospital could get at least 25-30 percent more if they join the corporate world,” says the medical and pharma vertical head at a global recruitment consultancy.What bothers the industry is the shortage of managerial staff comes at a time when the industry is facing headwinds.The numbers tell the storyThe average revenue per operational bed (ARPOB) of the companies tracked by ICRA has grown by a muted 2 percent in first half of FY19 on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, much below the five-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2 percent.The EBITDA dropped to the lowest in six-years to 11.4 percent in FY18 from the peak profitability of 15.7 percent in those years.“It all started with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the cap on prices of stents and knee implants by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) and stiff regulatory action by certain states, including putting restrictions on procedure rates, levying penalties and placing operational limitations on erring hospitals,” ICRA said in its recent report on hospital sector.The recent trade margin cap on 42 cancer drugs by the government is also seen to hit hospitals hard. The low package rates offered by much anticipated Ayushman Bharat also spooked corporate hospitals.None""I think given the headwinds the industry is facing both in terms of costs and ability to raise prices, I think obviously the efficiencies need to be improved,"" Mehta says.""So cost containment, cost optimisation and revenue enhance would be big focus areas for hospitals,"" he says."

title,Still haven't bought term insurance for your wife? Here's what you are missing
datetime,2019-03-08 20:07:00+00:00
description,The following article is an initiative of  Max Life Insurance and is intended to create awareness among readers
content,"Life insurance has been essentially sold to income-earning members of a family, and housewives are over-looked because there is no income to protect.A recent study by Max Life Insurance titled, ‘India Protection Quotient’, the ownership of life insurance and term insurance was lower in females as compared to males.“Women are an important part of financial freedom. In the same way that Jawaharlal Nehru had once said ‘If you educate a man, you educate one person. If you educate a woman, you educate a nation’, we believe that if you financially protect a woman, you protect a whole nation. Building awareness of insurance and making women participate in owning insurance will be a force multiplier and will go a long way building the financial protection of the country,” said Aalok Bhan, Director& Chief Marketing Officer, Max Life Insurance.Having said that, a term insurance plan for a homemaker should form an essential part of the financial plan as it enhances the financial coverage of your family. As incomes are almost stagnant and lifestyle expenses are increasing, it has become important to double the financial security of your loved ones, in case anything happens to you or both of you. The term plan for your wife ensures there is no financial constraints while fulfilling your child’s needs and upbringing, during any life event.To address the need of double security, many companies have now started to offer term plans to housewives that offer multiple benefits.None1. More coverage at lesser premium: You can take a term plan for your wife with a large cover and affordable premium amount. For a 28-year-old housewife, the Max Life Online Term Plan Plus offers Rs 50 lakh term cover for just Rs 277 per month.2. Increase protection whenever you want: You have the option to increase the sum assured in many life events such as marriage, child birth, etc.3. Save taxes too: The premiums paid and benefits received under these policies are eligible for tax benefits under Section 80C and 10(10D), respectively, of the Income Tax Act, 1961.It’s 2019 and homemakers shouldn’t be ignored while buying a term insurance plan. Once you decide to take a term plan, you should do a hygiene check on certain aspects.What to check:You should double check whether the cover amount would be sufficient for your loved ones. Consider your liabilities, habits and financial responsibilities before signing the document. Ideally, it should be at least 10-12 times your current salary.Also, compare the claim settlement ratio, process and go for reputed insurers. By choosing a brand, you’ll ensure your wife or kids don’t have to run from pillar to post to settle claims and entail the benefits. Companies such as Max Life settles claims instantly and without any hassles of paperwork. The company settled 98.26% of the total individual death claims in FY18, and as per IRDAI, it surpassed LIC in this regard. The InstaClaim process settles death claims within one day from the claim receipt."

description,"The bill, which promises 33 percent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha, was surprisingly also a part of the BJP’s manifesto ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha Polls."
content,"On the occasion of International Women’s Day, much has been spoken on the passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill.While the Congress has reiterated its promise to pass the bill if voted to power, the ruling BJP dispensation maintains a stoic silence on the subject.The bill, which promises 33 percent reservation for women in the Lok Sabha, was surprisingly also a part of the BJP’s manifesto ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha Polls.The bill also proposes that one-third of the seats from the reserved seats will be fixed for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The reserved seats will be allotted by rotation to different constituencies in the Lok Sabha. Besides, the reservation will cease to exist after 15 years of commencement of the law.However, it seems that there still are mixed opinions on the subject.Those who believe in the passage of the bill rely completely on the numbers. Out of a total of 543 MPs in the current Lok Sabha, only 62 are women. Essentially, that means one in every 10 parliamentarians is a woman, which is a skewed proportion considering that 49 percent of the Indian electorate consists of women.NoneWhile it is easy to label those against the bill as being ‘sexist’, it wouldn’t be fair to dismiss them.Those who are against the passage of the bill argue that reserving a constituency for a woman would translate to a loss of opportunity for the men who could have been better or more qualified candidates. This could also result in disregarding the choice of the voter.In addition, the Women’s Reservation Bill comes in with the same shortcomings as any other law that renders quota to the underprivileged. It has been argued, that in a representative democracy, where 131 of 543 seats are already reserved for SCs and STs, an additional 33 percent quota will be a disproportionate representation of people’s wishes.Those against the bill suggest that instead of endorsing reservation, political parties must incorporate a bottom-up approach of inducting more women in their parties so as to increase representation in Parliament."

description,"When two assets move in the same direction together, they are considered to be highly correlated. When these asset class move in opposite direction, they would be negatively correlated."
content,"Correlation of assets measures how an asset class moves in comparison to another asset class.When two assets move in the same direction together, they are considered to be highly correlated. When these asset classes move in the opposite direction, they would be negatively correlated.A positive correlation would mean that when one asset class return increases the other asset class return also increases. The closer to '1' correlation, the better correlated they are. A correlation of '1' would mean that the assets have a perfect positive correlation.A negative correlation would mean when both asset class returns move in the opposite direction. That is when one asset class return increases the other decreases. A correlation of '0' means no correlation and a '-1' indicates a perfect negative correlation.For example, we have considered different indices as a proxy to different asset classes. The correlation matrix for the same is given below.We can observe from the matrix that gold is uncorrelated or minorly negatively correlated to mostly all other indices. All the equity indices are highly correlated with each other.None Rolling Returns:None Given above is the representative of the rolling returns for Sensex index, gold price and Crisil Gilt index.The correlation can be observed in this chart as well. From November 2005 to November 2007 gold returns had a high correlation with equity, as they moved in the same direction. While gold had a negative correlation with Sensex from June 2011 till date.Adding negatively correlated asset like gold to other asset class reduces the risk considerably. The best asset allocation comes from combining negatively correlated assets.Low correlation reduces the volatility of a portfolio without necessarily affecting the expected level of return.Portfolio construction and diversification are heavily influenced by the correlation between different assets.The author is Head of Sales & Marketing at IDFC AMC. "

title,Option Writing: A friend or a foe? Here are 3 types of option writing
datetime,2019-03-09 12:19:00+00:00
description,"Directional writing is a little sophisticated writing, where medium-term views on a stock is traded with a short Option instead of a long Option."
content,"Shubham AgarwalTime and again we are reminded of constantly depreciating characteristic of 'Options'. While the certainty of it makes this rather a straight forward feature to trade.We can mix it with directional moves and its impact that is the premiums of options become more complicated than the underlying themselves.However, there are times and ways to attack this wasting characteristic of options but one needs to keep in mind what kind of option writer one wants to be and then stick to the mechanism of that kind of writer.Today we will talk about 3 kinds of option writing:> DirectionalNon-Directional writing is mostly the starting point for most of the option writers. In a lull one or two months of selling both calls and put options give money and it becomes handy so one puts it in practice.Believe me, these lulls can last long enough to get one hooked to it. Talk about the 400 points range in recent times or the biggest I have traded so far was 2009-2010.As easy as it is to make money out of writing without any mechanism, in this lull if one wants to make a full-time trade allocation to this exercise, there has to be a mechanism in place, because once a trending move sets in it could ruin a year-long pay-off in just a month.1. There are various tools in place from simple ones like Bollinger Bands (can be googled) or quite simply the heaviest call and put open interest strikes to ballpark a trading range, use them to choose the strike rather than randomizing the strike selection.2. Always have an exit strategy in place before entering (True for any kind of writing). I have resorted to either buying farther Options (Higher Call & Lower Put than Shorted) or placing a stop loss at twice the premium receivedIntentional Writing:This is one of my favorites where one has a clear cut intention which is aligned with the obligation that the short option comes with, making it technically risk-free to trade Options Short.For Example, if one holds a stock trading at 100 and intends to sell it at 110, in that case, go ahead and Sell the Call of 110 @ 1. In case, the stock ends up at 114 on expiry, it will be sold @ 114, Option would incur a loss of 4.Adjusting for the upfront premium received (114 – 4 + 1), the stock is sold at 111. On the other hand, if the stock fails to deliver once again next month one more option could be sold, which in turn would add up to the selling price.Similar Trade can be done by selling a Put if one intends to buy lower.NoneLastly, we have Directional writing:This is a little sophisticated writing, where medium-term views on a stock are traded with a short Option instead of a long Option.The methodology remains more or less the same as the intentional writing with a difference of the underlying.Instead of underlying, there are stop losses that are observed and the trade is exited if the stock moves unfavourably beyond a point.Participation led to liquidity and longer periods of lull seems to have pushed the participants towards this technique of writing. Nonetheless if one has the directional expertise, this could very well be a good money maker.None(The author is CEO & Head of Research at Quantsapp Private Limited)"

The indicator is also referred to as a stop and reverse system, which is abbreviated as SAR.NoneWhat is 'Parabolic SAR'?Parabolic SAR was originally named ""Parabolic Time/Price System"" with SAR an acronym for ""stop and reverse"". Technical analysts often refer to the indicator as simply ""SAR"" or ""PSAR"".It finds the potential reversals in the price of traded assets such as securities and currency & commodities and can be used to provide the entry and exit points.NoneOne of the most interesting aspects of this indicator is that it assumes that the trader is fully invested in a position at all point in time. For this reason, it is of specific interest to those who develop trading systems and traders who wish to always have money at work in the market.Construction of Parabolic SAR IndicatorThe PSAR indicator is somewhat complex to calculate by hand and most traders simply use trading software to chart it. Parabolic SAR (SAR) is a time and price technical analysis tool primarily used to identify points of potential stops and reverses.NoneWhen graphically plotted on a chart, the Parabolic SAR indicator is displayed as a series of dots.

We have used ADX, +DI & - DI indicator for considering the strength of the trend with parabolic SAR.3. Parabolic SAR point is below candle (bullish signalNone3. Parabolic SAR point is above candle (bearish signal)Rather than putting in one stop loss below where a trader entered a long position or above where the trader entered a short position, using the Parabolic SAR as a trader's guide, the stop loss is gradually raised for a long position and lowered in a short position, effectively locking of profits. It acts as a time stop too. Traders should use the SAR in conjunction with other technical indicators to maximize their odds of success.> The indicator tends to produce good results in a trending environment, but should not be used when the price starts moving sideways.(The author is Head-Technical & Derivative Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors)"

title,Millions of Facebook users migrating to Instagram: Report
datetime,2019-03-12 10:11:00+00:00
description,Facebook is losing users in their coveted 12-to 34-year-old demographic. 
content,"A recent study by Edison Research claims that Facebook user base in the United States is shrinking by the millions. The study was based on data compiled by the firm. According to the survey, Facebook is losing users in their coveted 12-to 34-year-old demographic.It shows a continuing drop in users from 2017. Despite Edison’s study Facebook has reported 2.32 billion active users every month, a 9-percent increase year-over-year. A drop in Facebook’s U.S. user base hasn’t really made any impact on its global growth. The survey found that an estimated 15 million fewer people use Facebook today than they did in 2017.Facebook's privacy woes continue One thing’s for certain, Facebook’ privacy woes and breach of user trust are showing noticeable effects on its most coveted audience. In an interview with Marketplace, Edison Research president Larry Rosin addressed the decline in users, “I don’t see how you couldn’t say it’s a meaningful drop. Fifteen million is a lot of people, no matter which way you cut it. It represents about 6 percent of the total US population ages 12 and older.”A better social network for young audiences Another interesting aspect of this decline in users is that Facebook users – millennials and teenagers in particular – may not be leaving the social media platform entirely. But instead, they might just be heading to another platform. Facebook-owned Instagram has gained immense popularity in recent years, becoming a hipper and more modern social network for younger audiences.Instagram vs Facebook"

title,Vivek Gadodia: From system analyst to market wizard
datetime,2020-01-06 22:53:00+00:00
description,"While trading a number of weaknesses get exposed, how those weaknesses are overcome determines a successful trader. Here's one such journey..."
content,"Shishir Asthana'Losing a position is aggravating, whereas losing your nerve is devastating.' This quote from unarguably one of the best traders in the world – Ed Seykota rings a bell with everyone who has been in the market. Once in a while comes a trade which will test a trader's nerve. This make or break moment defines the trader.Vivek Gadodia, who derives his inspiration from Seykota came out victorious after losing his nerve at a time when he had established himself as a trader. Support from family and friends brought him back on the track, but not before leaving a permanent imprint on him.A system analyst who carved his own path into trading Vivek Gadodia is a self-taught algo trader. Starting by managing small money from his natural market (family and friends) Vivek grew to become one of the biggest non-bank traders in the currency market in the country.His background in systems and his experience in trading led him to the second position globally in designing market neutral algorithm of US equities in a competition conducted by one of the world's largest crowd-sourced hedge fund.NoneVivek is a movie buff, especially market movies, and going on treks to lakes in the Himalayas. The little free time he gets he loves spending it with his family.In an interview with Moneycontrol Vivek speaks about his journey as a successful trader which he says has also been a journey in self-discovery.Q: How did a system analyst become a trader?A: It was a slow but natural transition. My background is in commerce and I have an MBA in Systems from Sydenham College, Mumbai. Post my education I got a job in a software company called CMC, which was acquired by TCS. My job there was as an analyst cum programmer for the treasury division. It was here that I was exposed to forex trading.While writing the software in the treasury division the market caught my fancy. Perhaps it has to do with my exposure to the market during my school days. My grandfather used to dabble in stocks and he always asked me to mark the share prices of his portfolio in The Economic Times. I had seen prices move up and down in my early years but did not make much of it. Now in CMC, it all came back and I could relate to what was happening. In order to know more about what was happening, I started reading as much as I could on markets.Later I joined HSBC Bank, but here I was posted in the technology side of their human resources department. While I had no direct exposure to the market, I was bitten by the bug. This was the 2004-07 period, one of the biggest bull runs in the Indian market.My interaction with friends and colleagues was all about markets. I was more interested in news and developments in the market during those days.Though I used to trade in a number of stocks the primary ones were from the IT sector. I remembered reading Peter Lynch who said that we should stay in companies and industries that we understand.I came across a Deloitte report on the top 200 IT companies, I picked up the top three companies from it and started trading. I remember Geodesic and Cranes Software, do not quite remember the third one. I remember telling all my friends how great these companies were and why they should own it. Markets were so strong back then that my trades on very basic knowledge would do well.Then one day in July 2007 I saw visible greed in the market and decided to sell all my stocks. One event which led me to do this was something that happened in our company – HSBC.Being associated with the HR department of a multinational bank, we could see the effects of the bull market in our hiring. Back then we were hiring entry-level MBAs, who were not from top-level business schools and paying them more than a branch manager, an IIM graduate with more than five years of experience.Warren Buffett's quote of one should be fearful when others are greedy flashed in front of my eyes. I felt that things heating up too much and decided to sell my portfolio. By July 2007, I was sitting on cash. In fact, I went a step further, I bought puts. But by December 2007 I had blown up my account as the sharpest rally of the 2004-07 bull run took place in the last six months.In January 2008, while going to my office, I got a call from my father saying that the market had hit the lower circuit. I felt vindicated with the fall but at the end of the day, I did not make money. Being right in your view and making money on your view are two different things. I decided to find a way to integrate the two.Q: How did you come back in the market?NoneI managed to get a job in Philips Capital. I was working with a team that was responsible for setting a high-frequency trading (HFT) – algorithmic trading desk for a bunch of traders who were returning back to India from the US.By now I was deep into trading books. I had discovered that I was not a buy and hold type of guy but preferred trading. Within trading, I preferred trend-following than other forms. The turning point for me came when I read Ed Seykota's interview in the bestselling book Market Wizard authored by Jack Schwager.In 2008,  I also took a part-time Applied Finance course with IIM Calcutta, which helped me appreciate derivatives better.By late 2008, I was again in the markets. This was the time of extreme pessimism. I remember discussing with a friend a day when there was only one share traded in Shoppers Stop. We were discussing that something had to be done, markets cannot go on like this for long.By March 2009, Nifty crossed the 3,000 marks, technically the first sign of bullishness for me. Some of the good technical analysts that I was in touch with also saw the change in trend. But the offices in which they were working prevented them from giving buy calls to their clients. I had no such restrictions as I was trading in my account.But I was also cautiously bullish and for every three long calls, I bought a hedge. As the markets entered into elections, I was holding a buy position. Post the election result, market hit the upper circuit. This one move helped me recoup all my losses made in the second half of 2007.By 2010, I decided to quit my day job and get into Algorithmic trading full time. Those were early days and few people had even heard of this term. I started off with money from family and friends.This was the most testing phase of my trading career. I made all the possible mistakes ever written about. Slowly, but surely, I started making progress by learning from my mistakes. It took me two years to find my mojo. By the time I got my first client as a trader it was December 2012, nearly two years after I quit my job, but by now I was baptised by fire and was confident of my abilities.Q: Psychologically, did you go through any changes during this period?A: The biggest hurdle to me was psychological. I was only a trend-following trader back then, and as you know the general win-loss ratio of a trend follower is low. In my case, it was around 35-40 percent.I have been a good student throughout my school and college life, who topped the class and studied to get the perfect score. This 35-40 percent win rate in the market did not match with my expectations of being right all the time.I was constantly in search of the proverbial Holy Grail. The eureka moment for me was the Ed Seykota interview in Market Wizard. His 'Whipsaw Song' exemplifies the predicament of a trend follower. He says 'One good trade makes for all the small losses' which clicked with me.Q: How did you trade in your earlier days and how did you evolve?A: I was only a trend follower during my initial days. I used the Donchain Channel on a three-minute timeframe and traded in four to five stocks. During my initial days, I used to trade on intra-day basis.This was mainly because I had seen the Algo traders at Philip Capital trade profitably on an intra-day basis, and this was ingrained in my mind. I was under the assumption that Algo trades work better on an intraday basis. My trading decisions were also to some extent influenced by newsflow and discussions with other traders on what they were doing.However, when I was logging my trades and referring to them again I noticed that my trades would have given better results had I held on to my position over the next few days.Post this realisation, I shut all noises -- switched off business channels on TV and stopped discussing markets with others and looking at charts. My performance improved considerably. Risk management and positional sizing further helped improve my performance.The Rs 10 lakh from my first client reached Rs 15 lakh in three months. My confidence improved and I added a couple of more stocks. I scaled up slowly adding more clients over the years.In these formative years, I diversified and added currency and commodities to my trading basket. The basic strategy remained the same, but we tinkered with the timeframe. In the case of currency and commodities, we moved to a 15-minute timeframe. We scaled up our currency trading so much that we were the largest non-bank trader in some currency pairs.The high leverage the currency market offered, helped us improve our performance. Our best period was around August 2013 where the rupee moved steadily against the dollar and equity markets were tanking. In essence, both were trending. In one month, we managed a return of 80 percent and our overall portfolio almost doubled in that month.However, after Raghuram Rajan became the Reserve Bank India Governor in 2013, volatility in the currency market reduced. We started reducing our position in the currency market and focused on equity markets. Commodity markets too were moving sideways and managing these trades after equity markets closed was no longer remunerative. This helped us increase our focus on equities.Just as in the 2009 elections I was able to catch the up move in 2014 elections. Many people prefer to stay out of the markets during election times, however, our back-testing has shown that ahead of a big move in the market the charts on the hourly or lower timeframe start moving in line with that trend well ahead of the event occurring.Even in case of the 2008 fall, the lower time frames were all in the sell mode well before the lower circuit in the market. Same was the case during the upper circuit in 2009.The difference in 2014 was though the market had given a buy signal, because of the size of our fund, I started to hedge my position. Thus even as the market moved higher my return was off the mark because of the hedges.As we grew in account size and the number of clients increased we grew more cautious, our mindset moved from chasing returns to controlling risk.Q: How did you go about improving your performance?A: During my earlier phase, I was running a stop and reverse strategy, which meant I was always trading in the market. This strategy was either giving a buy or a sell signal. While the strategy was working very well in a trending market, I was not comfortable employing this strategy in a sideways market. As liquidity dries up in a sideways market, it resulted in higher execution cost – a double whammy on my returns.After a lot of reading and attending trading conferences I came up with an idea of adding a second timeframe – a higher one as a filter. I researched and optimised on timeframes and finalised on 30 minutes. My trading timeframe remained three minutes however my first filter was 30 minutes.If I want to take a long trade, the moving averages on the 30 minutes timeframe should suggest a buy. I will then take the next buy signal on the three-minute timeframe. I undertake the trade when all timeframes are aligned. This filter helped me in improving my returns in a big way.I use other filters such as ADX (average directional index), an indicator which determines the strength of a trend.  If ADX is above a certain level, only then I am looking to go long or short in a particular stock. After adding ADX, my number of trades reduced, but more importantly the drawdowns were lower without compromising on my returns.This two-three month period where I was testing every method to improve my returns was one of the most rewarding periods of my trading career. The challenge for me in selecting the filter was not to lose the core of my original strategy but to improve my performance.The other thing I worked on was the stock selection. This was after a chat I had with an institutional trader, where we were discussing my style of trading. The trader asked me why I was trading the same set of stocks every time. I told him I have back-tested my strategy in these stocks and it worked very well.He asked 'Which part of the country I was from'. I told him I was from Rajasthan and my forefathers migrated to Mumbai many years back. He asked 'Why did they migrate to Mumbai.' To which I replied 'In search of better opportunities.' He quipped 'That is exactly what I am trying, trade in stocks where there is an opportunity rather than stagnant stocks.'This idea struck a cord with me and I began to look at stocks offering better opportunities.I found that the equity curve of a system is mean-reverting, which meant that the trading system will fluctuate between making and losing money. If we take care of the winning phases and let them run, then the equity curve will have a steady upward slope. If we trade in a stock moving sideways, it will impact the equity curve and portfolio returns.NoneTo select the stocks to trade, I periodically scan my pre-selected list and rank them based on their equity curve. I select those stocks with a higher ranking.  This helps in making my system dynamic. I only trade stocks that are trending and offering better returns. I automatically move out of stocks that are trading sideways.I have manually back-tested this screening methodology from 2012 onwards and found that this process clearly gives me an edge over trading in a fixed set of stocks. Since the last two years, I have been trading successfully using these filters. Life is more peaceful now and sleep better at night.Q: How do you exit from your position?A: While I may choose to enter the day's high or at any such level, my exits are always indicator based. I am completely fine undertaking a trade in the same stock even after it has been continuously stopped out five to six times. I trade using seven strategies and do not risk more than 0.5 percent of my capital in each trade. In some of our large clients, the risk tolerance is 0.25 percent.Some of my strategies are trend following, while others are based on the principle of mean reversal, while others are based on a mixture of technical and fundamentals analysis.The core trend-following strategy has a win-loss ratio of 36 percent. The others range between 45 and 55 percent. However, for every Rs 1,000 lost we earn Rs 2,200.Q: What has been the defining moment in your journey as a trader?A: This was a day in 2016 when the credit policy coincided with the weekly (Thursday) Bank Nifty expiry day. The market fell immediately after the RBI governor changed the policy rate (repo rate). I shorted the market with a large position. The position was larger than what I normally undertake. The market direction turned and it started to trend higher. At that time, I was also short in the currency market which too started to trend higher.Since I had made up my mind that the market was headed downwards, I held on to that view overriding my own built-in system. This bigger than normal position clouded my decision-making ability. It did not help that I had partied hard the previous night and was not as alert as I usually am.By the end of the day, I had 15 percent of our capital. Worse, some clients decided to withdraw their capital based on that day's performance. I was shaken and had my confidence.I was lucky to have the support of my family, especially my brother who helped me emotionally to get back on my feet. My friends registered me for a Vipassana course, which helped me refocus. For me, trading has been a journey towards financial freedom and has helped me become a better person.I have given up late night parties and am more focused on my work. Every morning I remind myself never to make that big mistake again. I am fine with taking small losses but a 15 percent portfolio loss is a strict no.There may be days when I will have to take a big loss, but I ensure that it will not be on account of me overriding my system. Now we have included enough checks and balances in the system itself that will prevent me from overriding it.Q: What are your future plans?A: On the trading front, we are looking to improve our risk-adjusted returns. At the portfolio level, we have positive returns 75 percent of the time. We are working towards improving that and adding more strategies to have a market-neutral long-short position at any point in time.On the business front, we are looking at growing our advisory business by adding more institutional clients and managing bigger portfolios. "

content,"To ensure students are engaged, motivated and challenged, Mumbai-based Thakur Institute of Aviation Technology (TIAT) has taken a leap in redefining education practices by introducing virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for the aviation space.The module, named future of education version 3.0, uses technology such as a head-mounted display, controllers, sensors, and 3D visualization equipment such as Virtual CAVE among others, to enable digital content in futuristic classrooms.Further, to enhance experimental learning techniques, students are given a live demonstration of how to get into a cockpit and operate an aircraft with a detailed study on how the engine, cabin, tail section, and landing gear work.Rajesh Singh, Chief Executive Officer, Thakur Institute of Aviation Technology (TIAT), India said, “Students generally face a problem of having enough theoretical knowledge, but to gain practical knowledge, they would have to leave the classrooms and travel to far off places. The advantage of this technology is they can get practical knowledge without having to travel long distances often on virtual reality.”Singh believes that the ecosystem of education needs to be upgraded for experimental learning techniques which can save a lot of time, money and energy. Students do not have to travel to far off places to see the functions of an aircraft, with learning to quicker and more effective as compared to current practices.Singh said that education institutes overseas have adopted such technologies which have boosted learning. India being a vast human resource supply to the world, is beginning to adopt it now, with huge potential to grow in the near future."

description,"At one stage, the DMK too was said to have been keen on a tie-up with the DMDK, but earlier last week it announced the conclusion of its alliance, shutting doors on any more partners."
content,"Ending days of suspense and hard bargain, the ruling AIADMK on March 10 inked an electoral pact with DMDK led by actor-turned politician Vijayakanth, allotting it four of the 39 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu.An agreement was signed between the top leadership of the two parties -- Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam and Vijayakanth and DMDK Treasurer and his wife Premalatha here.Incidentally, the announcement came shortly after the Election Commission announced the Lok Sabha poll schedule. Tamil Nadu is going to polls on April 18.The AIADMK-led alliance already has the BJP, PMK, Puthiya Tamizhagam and AINRC as its members. Talking to reporters at a star hotel, where the final leg of parelys which stretched to over two weeks were held, Panneerselvam, the coordinator of the AIADMK, said it was a committed alliance.""It has been decided to allot 4 seats to DMDK. In the bypolls to 21 Assembly constituencies, the DMDK will support the AIADMK,"" he said.Describing his party led front as ""a mega and victory alliance"", he said the constituencies to be contested by the allies will be announced after consultations.The finalisation of the alliance with DMDK brings the curtains down on days of uncertainty amid reports that the party was seeking higher share of seats. Several rounds of talks were held between the leaders of the two parties and even senior BJP leader and Union Minister Piyush Goyal, election in-charge of the party, had met Vijaykanth at his home.The DMDK was expected to be part of the alliance in time for the March 6 election rally addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi near here. However, it did not materialise though leaders of the two parties had indicated that by the next meeting to be addressed by Modi in the state, the alliance would be firmed up.At one stage, the DMK too was said to have been keen on a tie-up with the DMDK, but earlier last week it announced the conclusion of its alliance, shutting doors on any more partners.The DMK has entered into alliance with Congress, VCK, IUML, MDMK and CPI-M and CPI.By signing the pact with the DMDK, the AIADMK has almost come to the penultimate stage of finalising the alliance led by it in Tamil Nadu. Already, the party has finalised seat sharing with BJP and PMK and a few smaller outfits for the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, alloting 18 of the 40 seats at stake.It has allotted seven seats to PMK, five to the BJP and one to Dalit-based Puthiya Tamizhagam in the state and the lone Puducherry seat to AINRC. The alliance parties have also agreed to extend support to the AIADMK for the byelections.There are expectations that former Minister GK Vasan led Tamil Maanila Congress may join the AIADMK front, giving the final shape to the combine that will take on the DMK-led alliance.Asked if there was a scope for Tamil Maanila Congress joining the AIADMK front, Paneerselvam said ""a good decision"" will be out in a day or two. ""It is a robust coalition,"" he said adding interview of candidates seeking party tickets will commence from tomorrow at AIADMK headquarters.The AIADMK which for the first time joined hands with DMDK in 2011 is again tying up with that party after a long hiatus.Premalatha pledged her party's support to the AIADMK in the bypolls to 18 assembly seats, to be held along with the Lok Sabha polls, and local body elections, expected in May. Asked if she was satisfied with the number of seats offered to her party, the DMDK leader said ""yes, there is nothing in numbers, it all boils down to your thought process.""She was apparently indicating that AIADMK and DMDK were together in their line of thought.""It is a victory alliance and an example is 2011 Assembly election when the AIADMK-DMDK alliance had a big win,"" Premalatha said."

content,"NoneUnless the Ruias, the Essar Steel promoters, plan to contest it, the order clears the way for LN Mittal to finally establish himself in his home market. The Indian market, one of the fastest growing in the global steel industry, is the only missing piece in the portfolio of the world's largest steelmaker.The bench has additionally asked the lenders to share 15 percent of the bid with operational creditors, who had earlier this week appealed to ArcelorMittal to consider their dues too.""We welcome today’s pronouncement by the NCLT Ahmedabad. While we will need to review the full written order once it becomes available, we hope to complete the transaction as soon as possible,"" ArcelorMittal said in a statement.The court also turned down the petition from Essar Steel directors, including Prashant Ruia, who said that they should have been consulted by the Committee of Creditors before arriving at a resolution.Few options now remain for the Ruias, for whom Essar Steel was the jewel crown. While they could challenge today's ruling and move the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and Supreme Court, experts feel their chances of getting a favourable verdict are slim.The Ruias, though, are not ready to throw in the towel yet.""We continue to believe that our settlement proposal of Rs 54,389 crore is the most compelling one available to Essar Steel creditors and fulfills the IBC’s declared overriding objective of value maximisation,"" said a statement from an Essar spokesperson.Adding that the Group stands by the legality of its offer to withdraw Essar Steel from insolvency proceedings under Section 12A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the spokesperson added: ""We are awaiting a copy of the NCLT order, and will take a call on next steps after examining the same.""Apart from the bid amount, ArcelorMittal will also invest up to Rs 8,000 crore in Essar Steel facilities. The Essar plant in Gujarat has a capacity to produce 10 million tons a year, and ArcelorMittal plans to expand further.Even as the LN Mittal-company gets one step closer to Essar Steel, it still has to put in place a few missing pieces. According to media reports, ArcelorMittal has offered to buy the port facility, power plant and EPC arm from the Ruias. These facilities are integral to the plant's functioning.The sagaThe Essar Steel insolvency case, the largest among the first list of bankruptcy companies referred by the RBI to NCLT, has been like a never ending saga.It long ago breached the 270-day deadline set for solving insolvency cases, and there were many twists to the tale.Initially, the battle was between ArcelorMittal and Numetal, the consortium led by Russia's VTB Bank, and also included Rewant Ruia, son of Ravi Ruia, one of the Essar Group founders.Both their bids were termed ineligible by the NCLT, according to the Clause 29A of the Insolvency and Bankrupcty Code. The Clause prevents promoters of defaulting companies from bidding for stressed assets.While ArcelorMittal's stakes in Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron came under the scanner, presence of Rewant Ruia in Numetal was seen as a case of 'connected person.'While ArcelorMittal agreed to repay Uttam Galva's debts of Rs 8,000 crore, Numetal contested the order that led the Mittal company clear dues.In October last year, the Supreme Court asked both the sides to clear dues to be eligible. This despite Rewant Ruia moving out of the Numetal consortium. Instead, JSW Steel teamed up with Numetal. Vedanta too entered the fray with an offer of Rs 35,000 crore."

title,"Don't be fooled by Women's Day offers on savings bank accounts, look before you leap"
datetime,2019-03-08 16:20:00+00:00
description,Savings bank accounts specifically targeted at women come with extra features. But check if you really need them as they come with additional cost.
content,"NoneTypically, these accounts are offered on women’s day, so there’s a good chance that women bank customers might be offered these accounts today. Several offers come bundled with a women’s saving bank account in the form of shopping discounts and such added benefits. But do you really need them? Let’s take a look on what’s on offer.NoneTypically, a women’s saving bank starts by offering a lower minimum balance requirement as compared to a regular savings account. For example, minimum balance of women’s savings account at RBL bank is Rs 10,000 against Rs 25,000 in regular savings bank account.The women savings account can usually be opened either individually or jointly as a primary account holder, so there is not much difference here.Some of the other benefits that come with women saving accounts are doorstep banking services, insurance covers like critical illness and/or personal accident covers, an additional kids’ account, discount/cash back offers for shopping through credit cards specially designed for women customers, etc.For instance, with ICICI Bank’s women advantage savings account, you are eligible for iProtect smart life cover which provides protection against accidental death and 34 critical illnesses.IDBI bank is offering a zero balance children’s account with a women’s account, if required. Similarly, the debit and credit cards associated with the women savings account allow users to avail exclusive discounts and offers on products from select merchant partners including restaurants, jewelers and departmental stores.Note that these women-specific credit cards are not available to women customers if they are second-holders to someone else’s savings bank account, such as their spouse or their children.In addition, some of the banks offer discount on processing fees (25% to 50%) while applying for two-wheeler loans and discount of 10% to 15% on lockers' rent in the first year, etc.NoneNo Free LunchesThe features come at a cost. For instance, in iProtect smart life cover with ICICI Bank’s women advantage savings account you are eligible to get a life insurance cover as well as critical illness cover for a sum assured of Rs 4 lakh at a monthly premium of Rs 200. Note that the sum assured here is fixed at Rs 4 lakh for women aged 21 to 35 and Rs 3 lakh for women aged 36 to 50 years.A life cover and critical illness cover of just Rs 4 lakh is generally too less for women- or any individual- aged below 30, especially since at that age you could in fact buy a higher cover with, of course, more premium. A life cover should be at least ten times of annual income.Financial advisors always recommend keeping insurance and investments separate. It’s not recommended to opt for insurance cover just because you are getting an insurance benefit with your savings account at discounted premium as bank claims.Bhakti Rasal, Mumbai-based Certified Financial Planner cautioned, “There are chances of discontinuation from the insurance company at the renewal stage or rating up of the premiums as per the renewed group insurance contract between the banker and an insurance company.”Financial experts recommend buying insurance policies as per your needs and not buy it as a bundled product.Further, the account holder also needs to maintain monthly minimum balance in savings account which varies from bank to bank. On an average, the monthly minimum balance for women’s savings bank account required is Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000. There are banks which ask to maintain a fixed deposit with the women savings account. For instance, at IndusInd bank women customers of savings account need to maintain Rs 5 lakh in fixed deposit at all times.Banks are even offering attractive discounts / cash back offers for shopping to women account holders from merchants associated with the bank. Such discounts often entice customers to shop impulsively rather than when there’s a genuine need.Sapna Tiwari, Co-Founder and COO, Rupeewiz Investment Advisors said, “Often such consumers end up in equated monthly installments (EMI) trap by using their credit cards from women savings account and pay interest cost of 30% to 45% per annum (it varies with the bank).” You may even end up using your debit card which also has attractive discounts and utilize savings in shopping instead of investing for future goals.NoneThough women’s saving bank accounts come with added benefits that may not accrue to women if they are second holders to their spouses’ or children or someone else’s bank account, more often than not these benefits don’t add value. For instance, standalone insurance cover works better as you can customize to your needs.Locking away your money in a fixed deposit when you may not need one, may skew your asset allocation and lock your money away.If you already have a zero salaried account from your employer with similar benefits, you may not need another separate account. Since, it will be additional cost to maintain monthly minimum balance in savings account. And beware of the EMI trap as Tiwari explained above.Too many discounts and offers also come with the fineprint, which you should be prepared to go through minutely, if these discounts and add-ons attract you.For the majority though, we suggest you avoid women specific bank accounts. Stick to plain-vanilla bank accounts and opt for separate insurance cover and credit cards that suit your needs."

title,Is it mandatory to link Aadhaar with income tax returns?
datetime,2019-03-11 09:27:00+00:00
description,"Aadhaar linkage has become important for several transactions done online, such as on the EPFO website, at the time of opening or closing bank accounts or making financial investments online"
content,"Archit GuptaNoneThe government placed crucial arguments in favour of linking PAN and Aadhaar – citing duplicity of PAN numbers as a reason for tax evasion and the importance of fixing identity of taxpayer via Aadhaar to prevent misreporting of financial transactions undertaken.This section was added via the Finance Act and made effective from July 1, 2017. Even though this was not part of the Budget documents of 2017, it found a place in the amendments to the Finance Act 2017, placed before the Parliament for approval. The deadline was extended on several instances to allow taxpayers more time.Let us understand the law behind this newly introduced section 139AA. Section 139AA of the income tax act, lays down two basic rules, firstly, Aadhaar must be quoted in all PAN applications, secondly, Aadhaar must be quoted in income tax returns. It says that every person who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar as per the Aadhaar Act, 2016, must mention Aadhaar while filing tax returns.The Aadhaar Act further says that only a resident individual can obtain Aadhaar. The term ‘Resident’ has different meanings as per the Income Tax Act, FEMA and the Aadhaar Act. Since Resident for this purpose here shall be as per the Aadhaar Act; it means an individual who has resided in India for a period of 182 days or more in the 12 months immediately before the date of application for enrolment of Aadhaar.If this seems all too confusing, remember this basic rule if you have Aadhaar you must quote it while filing your income tax returns, if you are resident based on the Aadhaar Act, you must get yourself an Aadhaar and then link it with your PAN number.NoneThe central government has so far notified 4 categories of persons – residents of Assam, Jammu & Kashmir and Meghalaya; a non-resident Indian as per the income tax act; those who are more than 80 years old; and those who are not citizens of India. These individuals, who do not have an Aadhaar, are not required to obtain one for the purpose of filing tax returns. However, in case they do have an Aadhaar card it must be reported while filing tax returns. They may have got an Aadhaar for purposes other than reporting in tax returns. Do note that once an Aadhaar has been linked with your tax return, it cannot be delinked, even when a change in residential status takes place.This section further says that PAN numbers without Aadhaar will be invalid. However, it does not define the consequences of such invalidation. It is apparent that in such a case, one may not be able to file tax returns. The Supreme Court as part of the same ruling struck down the linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts and telephone numbers. In-validation of PAN due to non-linkage with Aadhaar could impact online transactions involving PAN such as payment of tax, deduction of TDS while buying a property etc.NoneAadhaar linkage has become important for several transactions done online, such as on the EPFO website, at the time of opening or closing bank accounts or making financial investments online. Non-linking of PAN could jeopardize some of these transactions. The Income Tax Department has set a final deadline of March 31, 2019 for linking of PAN with Aadhaar.None"

description,The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) in a circular said that the TCS amount would be excluded from the value of goods while computing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) liability.
content,"In a relief to buyers of high value cars and jewellery, the CBIC has said that the TCS amount would be excluded from the value of goods for computing GST liability.Under the Income Tax Act, tax collection at source (TCS) is levied at 1 per cent on purchase of motor vehicles above Rs 10 lakh, jewellery exceeding Rs 5 lakh and bullion over Rs 2 lakh. TCS is also levied on other purchases at different rates.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) in a circular said that the TCS amount would be excluded from the value of goods while computing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) liability.Earlier in December, the CBIC had said that the TCS amount would also be included while ascertaining the GST liability on goods on which TCS is applicable under the I-T Act.In view of the representations received from various stakeholders and after consultation with the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the CBIC has decided to exclude the TCS amount paid while valuing the goods for the purpose to levy GST.The CBDT has clarified that TCS is not a tax on goods but an interim levy on the possible ""income"" arising from the sale of goods by the buyer and to be adjusted against the final income-tax liability.""For the purpose of determination of value of supply under GST, Tax collected at source (TCS) under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 would not be includible as it is an interim levy not having the character of tax,"" the CBIC said.EY India Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said: ""This clarification comes as quite a relief for businesses specifically the automotive sector. While most industry players already believed that GST should not be levied on the Income tax TCS component, given the otherwise clarification by the Government, they were quite apprehensive of litigation on this aspect"".AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said the erstwhile circular issued by the CBIC unnecessary complicated the mechanism of calculating GST where TCS-Income tax was also collected by the supplier."

title,Should you opt for bank locker insurance by IFFCO Tokio GIC?

description,"This policy aims to offer cover the loss caused to your valuables in the bank locker, such as jewellery and other such valuables. Is it really worth it?"
content,"NoneThis policy aims to offer cover the loss caused to your valuables in the bank locker, such as jewellery and other such valuables. Is it really worth it?What works?It’s not just theft that the policy aims to cover your losses from. It offers to cover loss arising out of fire, earthquake, burglary, hold-up, fraud committed by a bank staff or any act of terrorism. It offers seven cover options to choose from. For instance, a policy with a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh comes at a premium of Rs 500 plus GST. A policy with a sum assured of Rs 30 lakh comes at a premium of Rs 2,000 plus GST.NoneTo buy this product, the consumer is expected to fill the form and submit a self-declaration of contents. The insurer insists on the valuation report by the government approved valuer only if value of an individual item is more than Rs 10 lakh and in cases where the total sum of all the valuable you wish to get covered for, exceeds Rs 40 lakh for an individual.""The insurance buyer can go to any government approved valuer and obtain a valuation certificate for articles to be insured. Valuation certificate is waived for an individual item less than Rs 10 lakh and the total sum assured below Rs 40 lakh to make buying process simple for insurance buyers as we rely on self-declaration by insurance buyer,"" said Subrata Mondal, EVP-Underwriting, IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company.In case of loss of your jewellery or other valuables, the insurer promises to make good your losses in case such loss is caused by one of the covered conditions.You also have the option of covering documents kept in the locker as an add-on rider. The sum insured for this kept at a maximum of Rs 25,000. In case of loss of documents, the insurer will pay for replacing the lost or damaged documents on actual basis (in simple words, the cost you incur to get a duplicate set of documents) subject to the sum assured.What does not work?The cover is applicable only for jewellery and other valuables kept in the bank locker. So gold kept at home is not covered. Standalone home insurance plans cover your jewellery that you store at home (you need to mention the jewellery in detail while buying the policy); some policies also cover the jewellery that you keep in your bank locker. The premium quoted by IFFCO Tokio is low, though, as it covers jewellery kept in bank locker only.While settling the claim the insurer will rely on the first information report filed by the bank and not you since the bank locker is owned by bank. The claim will be admissible if the bank lodges an FIR with the police. This makes the recovery process lengthier than usual.The policy is not available online. You have to approach the insurer and fill up the form and submit the declaration or the valuation certificate as applicable. The policy will be issued on case to case basis.Verdict:Insurance for content in locker under home insurance is not high on the shopping list of the insurance buyers as bank lockers are perceived as safe storage options by most individuals. ""Home insurance should be a higher priority for a customer, when compared to a bank locker protection plan. Also, if you are keen to insure your jewellery, it is better to go for all-risk jewellery cover,"" said Abhishek Bondia, co-founder and principal officer of SecureNow.  To be sure, the all-risk jewellery cover is a standalone policy that aims to cover all your jewellery; at home, in use and in your locker."

No doubt, there are exceptional flagships devices from LG, Sony, Xiaomi, and so on but the S10 Plus is the one that raised the notch this year.Let’s look at all the new changes the S10 Plus brings to the fold.The Galaxy S10 Plus looks nothing like the S8 Plus or the S9 Plus. Right off the bat, you are greeted by the S10 Plus’ big, nearly-bezel-less, bright Dynamic OLED display. And if that isn’t enough, the S10 Plus is super-light despite its glass and metal body. Going back to the screen, and you notice two holes instead of a notch which is the new 'in thing'. The two holes are placed to the top right of the S10 Plus and don’t really come in the way of anything and aren’t entirely noticeable. The Galaxy S10 Plus also uses an ultra-sonic in-display fingerprint sensor which is fast, to say the least.In terms of performance, the S10 Plus is a monster. Samsung’s latest 7-nm Exynos 9820 chipset coupled with 8GB of RAM ensures a seamless experience regardless of the task. The S10 Plus’ 7-nm chip and 4100 mAh battery capacity combine to offer excellent power efficiency, better than Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro. Additionally, all Galaxy S10 models feature ‘Reverse Wireless Charging’, meaning you can charge any device with wireless charging support by placing it on the back of the S10 Plus. Although this feature isn’t ideal for charging smartphones, it can be useful for charging smaller devices with wireless charging support. Additionally, Samsung’s new One UI feels modern and consistent, offers better one-handed functionality and boasts a ton of feature improvements.

description,here's a primer on how exactly Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) work to help you effortlessly cast your vote.
content,"NoneHow does an EVM work?Electronic Voting Machines operate on the ""press a button"" mode; there are no papers involved. An EVM typically comprises a ‘Control Unit’ and a ‘Ballot Unit’. These are connected by a 5-metre wire.NoneEVM decoded: EVM assembly comprising Control Unit, VVPAT and Balloting Unit (L-R)Each balloting unit accommodates up to 16 candidates. If it exceeds that, additional balloting units can be connected to increase the limit, the cap being 64. The machines run on six-volt batteries to do away with the need for any external source of power.The polling officer operates the Control Unit, while the electorate cast their votes on the Balloting Unit. The latter is placed inside an enclosed polling area. After the election official presses the ballot button on the control unit, the balloting unit gets activated.Once this is done, the voter is allowed to enter the voting enclosure. Beside every candidate’s name on the machine, there’s a blue button. The voter needs to press the button adjacent to the name of their favoured candidate and the respective party’s symbol. The machine then records the vote.After the voter has pressed one button on the unit, it gets locked for further voting. Therefore, one must think hard before casting their vote, because in case of a change of mind, nothing can be done. Any button pressed after the first attempt, will not be counted as a vote.Notably, the machines were crafted in such a way that casting votes became less cumbersome and time taking alongside ensuring that no miscreant gets away with mass voting.NoneThis was guaranteed by allowing EVMs to record only maximum of five votes per minute.One machine can record a maximum of 3,840 votes. The votes cast get stored in the memory for a period of at least 10 years."

The bank had reported a loss of Rs 1,524.31 crore in the year-ago period.Total income fell to Rs 6,190.94 crore for the quarter, compared with Rs 7,125.20 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.With regard to exposure of the insurance firm to debt- ridden IL&FS group companies, Khuntia said, the regulator will ensure that policyholders do not lose money.""Either they get it back fully or they will have to provide for it. Some of the IL&FS companies may be better off. We will find some ways so that policyholders are protected,"" he said.Speaking at the event, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and National Health Authority CEO Indu Bhushan said Ayushman Bharat (AB) has benefited 15 lakh people since its launch in September."

content,"WhatsApp is arguably one of the largest cross-platform instant messaging application in the world with over a billion active users. Apart from sending messages, the instant messaging platform also allows users to make international and domestic voice and video calls over the Internet at zero cost. The Facebook-owned entity continually rolls out new features to sustain its massive user base.However, several users still tend to flock over to rival apps or unofficial WhatsApp copies like GB WhatsApp or WhatsApp Plus resulting in the company issuing a warning to its users about the security perils of unofficial apps. The company believes downloading unscrupulous WhatsApp clones could potentially leave users open to security risks.A spokesperson for WhatsApp made a statement to The Indian Express stating, “WhatsApp cares deeply about the safety of our users. To protect the privacy and security of their account, we strongly recommend users only download WhatsApp from official app stores or from our website. We are continuing to step up our enforcement against imposter WhatsApp services to help curb abuse and keep WhatsApp users safe.”In order to prevent security breaches through unofficial WhatsApp clones, the company is imposing bans on users using these knock off apps. Additionally, users violating the norms could also have their entire chat history deleted. You’ll need to uninstall the app and download the official app from your respective app store if you get a message from WhatsApp that states – “Your phone number is banned from using WhatsApp. Contact support for help.”"

content,"Soon after unveiling the concept car at the Geneva Motor Show 2018, British luxury car maker McLaren entered their 2019 Senna GTR in production. Discarding all rules and limitations of making the car road-legal, the company has decided to give the Senna GTR a track-only status. Unsurprisingly, it gets as close to the company’s Formula One cars as it can.The Senna GTR is the third car to bear the “GTR” moniker after McLaren’s F1 and P1. The car also shares the carbon fibre monocoque with the Senna, giving it a dry weight of 1,198 kg. Compensating for the removal of road legal parts, the larger wing combined with the car’s diffuser gives it a downforce of 2,205 pounds, or close to 1,000 kilograms.NoneThe car is propelled by a 4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine. It makes the promised figure of 825 PS, which is 25 PS more than the road-legal Senna. It also makes 800 Nm of torque, which will contribute to a better power-to-weight ratio than its road-going counterpart. The Senna GTR uses a double-wishbone suspension system which has been derived from McLaren’s GT3 race program. It also comes shod with Pirelli slicks, which gives the car an estimated deceleration of more than 3g (that's thrice the earth's gravity).None"

description,Complete Javelin guide to help you layout the perfect strategy.
content,"Anthem is an online multiplayer action RPG, unlike BioWare’s usual single-player RPG formula. The game thrusts players into action-heavy scenarios with third-person shooter mechanics. Picking the right Javelin is key to defining your role in a team. Here’s a complete Javelin guide to help you layout the perfect strategy.RangerNoneThe Ranger is the first javelin class players will be able to access. This javelin suits several different playing styles from expert to novice and primarily focuses on precise damage and versatility. BioWare claims that Rangers will have a place in end-game activities despite being the starter class in the game. This javelin deals high single-target damage coupled with decent versatility in weapon choices and mobility. Novice pilots will find the Ranger’s vast array of weapons and abilities useful in sharpening their skills, while experts will appreciate the Ranger’s emphasis on exceptional marksmanship and skill mastery.InterceptorNoneThe Interceptor is the most throughout and agile javelin class in the game. This javelin class relies on agility and high damage output to finish off enemies before they can fight back. The high-mobility and huge damage output on the Interceptor class come at the expense of defence. This javelin’s unique passive skills make its shield recharge at a faster rate depending on your movement speed.ColossusNoneFor players who prefer to use brute force as a solution to every challenge, look no further than the Colossus. This javelin class focuses on damage mitigation and explosive power. The Colossus is built for survivability by drawing aggro away from fragile allies. However, its insane damage output comes at the expense of speed and mobility. The Colossus is the only javelin class in the game that can equip two heavy weapons at once.StormNone"

description,So far there are no vaccines in the world against Zika and Chikungunya.  
content,"Vaccine maker Bharat Biotech International said two of its vaccines against Zika and Chikungunya will be entering phase-II clinical trials, where they will be tested on humans for safety and efficacy.So far there are no vaccines in the world against Zika and Chikungunya.  Both are viral diseases and spread primarily by mosquito bites.“We are ready for phase-II trials,” said GVJA Harshvardhan, Director at Bharat Biotech.“In the first phase, the vaccine was tested on healthy volunteers to determine the safety,” Harshvardhan added.It takes around 10 to 15 years to complete all three phases of clinical trials of a vaccine before it can get marketing licensing. Phase-II trial takes around two years and the vaccine has to be tested on 200-300 patients.“Clinical trials require a lot of money, and the risk of failure is high,” Harshvardhan said.Bharat Biotech mitigates the risk of failure associated with R&D through research grants and supply commitments from funding agencies, governments and partnerships.The Hyderabad-headquartered company had successfully developed and launched vaccines for Japanese Encephalitis, Rotavirus and Typhoid. So far the company has invested around $200 million on vaccine development.Zika vaccineBharat Biotech surprised the world when it announced in February 2016 that it had developed two Zika vaccine candidates, one of them is an inactivated vaccine or that contains inactivated virus.The company also said it was probably the first in the world to file for a global patent for Zika Vaccine candidates.Apart from Bharat Biotech, globally several drugmakers including Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Cerus Corporation, Immunovaccine are in the race to develop a vaccine for Zika.Zika virus, transmitted through the aedes aegypti mosquito, causes fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain. Zika infections during pregnancy have been linked to miscarriage and can cause microcephaly, a potentially fatal congenital brain condition.In the backdrop of Zika outbreaks in India starting Ahmedabad in 2017, Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), according to media reports announced undertaking phase-II trial of the Bharat Biotech’s vaccine.Chikungunya vaccineBharat Biotech’s Chikungunya vaccine is in for development for some time. It completed Phase I in January 2018.It takes a lot of time in getting regulatory approvals, identifying right contract research organisation (CRO) and hospitals, before we administer a trial, Harshvardhan said.Chikungunya is associated with fever and joint pains is rarely fatal, but patients face the issue of mobility for some time.Private market focusNoneBut with rising competition from Chinese and South Korean vaccine makers and lower price realisations, Bharat Biotech is focusing on private label market where the margins are healthy, but barriers are high.The private market involves brand building and reaching out to doctors through a dedicated sales force, requiring a lot of investment on the front end, over and above the spend on research and development and manufacturing of vaccines.None"

He is serving as an interim head of India operations currently, after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) denied him a new three-year term late last year.In January, Jhaveri was named vice-chairman, banking, capital markets and advisory, Asia Pacific-a new position created with the responsibility to handle the lender's key clientele in the region.The Jhaveri eraJhaveri led Citi's India business for almost nine years. He took charge shortly after the banking behemoth had to restructure its global business following the financial crisis. A career Citibanker, he joined Citi India in 1987 and worked across multiple segments. He has a BCom degree from Mumbai's Sydenham College and an MBA in finance and economics from the Simon School of Business, USA.During his tenure, Citi maintained its lead as the biggest foreign lender by assets in India.

description,DGCA guidelines also invite ridicule
content,"The captain of Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed on March 10, had done 8,000 hours of flying time. Similarly, the two pilots on the Lion Air flight, which went down the Java Sea in October last year, had flown 5,000 and 6,000 hours.With that kind of experience proving not enough to prevent the crash, both involving the under-investigation Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, experts have questioned regulator DGCA's guideline that only pilots with a minimum of 1,000 flying hours should be at the controls of the plane.On March 11, a day after the Ethiopian Airlines crash that left nearly 160 dead, the DGCA issued additional guidelines for the Boeing aircraft. One of them is that the captain operating a Max aircraft should have 1,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot 500 hours.""The 1,000-hour guideline has been issued just to ensure that operations don't get effected. It is silly. How can even a pilot with more experience handle an aircraft failure for which he was never trained?"" asked a senior pilot at a private airline.Apart from this, the regulator has also laid down guidelines for checks and maintenance.NoneThe December guideline was issued after the Lion Air crash.NoneIndustry experts have also questioned the training part. ""I’ll be amazed if they can replicate the computer glitch in the simulator as they don’t have this malfunction or ‘non-normal’ condition built into the sim,"" said a senior pilot.""What we have is a ‘runway stabiliser’ condition which causes a nose down condition. But, the crashes are caused by a very rapid and uncontrollable nose down command due to an erroneous signal, and taking countermeasures at low altitudes may not work partially or fully,"" he added.In both the tragedies, the aircraft crashed within minutes of take-off; and their altitude fluctuated. In the Lion Air crash, investigations showed a malfunction in one of the sensors lead to the aircraft computer automatically initiating a dive. There were concerns that pilots weren't trained for this.Ground themIndustry, on the other hand, has asked for the grounding of these aircraft.In India, Jet Airways has five Max in its fleet, and SpiceJet 13.Apart from China, Australia and Singapore, many of the airlines have also grounded these aircraft until results of investigations are out.""They (DGCA) should be grounding the fleet,"" says Mark Martin, Founder of ]Martin Consulting, an aviation consulting firm. ""While it is too early to pinpoint on the reason behind the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the fact is that it was a new aircraft. Most of the countries are also grounding it. It is better to be safe,"" he added.Martin drew parallel with the experience of Airbus A320 aircraft, which was ""over computerised"" and took time for pilots to understand.In a statement on Tuesday, SpiceJet said:""The Boeing 737 MAX is a highly sophisticated aircraft. It has flown hundreds of thousands of hours globally and some of the world’s largest airlines are flying this aircraft.""""We are actively engaged with both Boeing and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and will continue to put safety first, as always. We have already implemented all additional precautionary measures as directed by the DGCA yesterday.""Jet Airways, which has grounded its Max planes, had on Monday said it is in contact with Boeing, and ""remains committed to implementing all directives or advisories that may be published by those authorized."""

Sadly, the Congress has never hesitated from dividing society. The worst caste riots and anti-Dalit massacres happened under Congress rule.""He added: “Gandhi understood the Congress culture very well, which is why he wanted it disbanded, especially after 1947.""Quoted Gandhi he wrote: ""I am sorry to have to say that many Congressmen have looked upon this item (Swaraj) as a mere political necessity and not as something indispensable.... I would go to the length of giving the whole Congress a decent burial, rather than put up with the corruption that is rampant.""Borrowing Gandhi’s thoughts on corruption, the PM said his government has ""done everything"" to punish the corrupt, "" but the Congress hasn’t. He added. There’s a Congress scam in every sector, ranging from defence and irrigation to sporting events and rural development.He also accused Congress bigwigs of filling their own coffers to lead a luxurious lifestyle while denying basic necessities to the poor.Quoting Gandhi again, the PM blamed the Congress of practicing dynasty politics although Mahatma Gandhi ""despised"" it.Talking about stifling democracy and democratic processes, Modi referred to the 1975 Emergency imposed by former PM Indira Gandhi. ""A firm believer in democracy, Bapu said, 'I understand democracy as something that gives the weak the same chance as the strong.' Ironically, Congress gave the nation the Emergency, when our democratic spirit was trampled over. The Congress misused Article 356 several times. If they did not like a leader, that Government was dismissed. Always eager to promote dynastic culture, Congress has no regard for democratic values,” Modi wrote."

While Yatra has confirmed that its board is reviewing the proposal, it has also asked its stakeholders not to take ""any action"" at this time.Many see the offer as an unsolicited bid. Perhaps due to Ebix’s sharply-worded statement that it would reduce the offer if it did not receive ""a positive engagement response from the Yatra Online Board in a timely manner"". Yatra has been given a week's time to open its books for the due diligence.Industry insiders believe that the money on the table for Yatra is too lucrative given its current position.

This opens up an opportunity for investors.NoneThe moot question is: will the superior performance of paper companies and their stock prices continue? Let’s look at the factors that will determine the future profitability of the sector.NoneIn short, the demand-supply gap is likely to remain favourable in the near to medium term.NoneAsia Pulp & Paper (APP), an Indonesian paper company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with The Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB) for setting up India’s largest paper mill in a single site with a staggering 5 MT per annum (mtpa) capacity in Andhra Pradesh. However, it will take a long time for the capacity to come on stream.The improved performance of paper companies is also due to better realisations, driven by high input cost. International pulp prices, a key raw material continued to inch up till September-end, pushing up paper prices in turn. While there has been a mild moderation in the third quarter of FY19, global pulp prices are expected to remain firm in the medium term.Environmental restrictions by the Chinese government on imports of low grade recovered paper are expected to keep global pulp prices elevated. China, the largest importer of waste paper globally, announced a ban on certain grades of waste paper in July 2017, which came into force in January 2018. The move led to increased demand for pulp, pushing up global pulp prices and consequently global paper prices.NoneNoneSource: Care RatingsNoneNoneNonePaper stocks have outperformed on the back of improving financials and strong earnings growth. While some part of the valuation re-rating seems to have played out, tailwinds in the sector provide strong earnings visibility.NoneNoneNoneNoneJK Paper is best positioned within the sector due to its strong market position and presence in high quality paper segments, established brand name, cost leadership and integrated production capacities.JK Paper stands out as it sources more than 80 percent of its wood requirements from captive farm forestry. Additionally, adequate water is available at both of its units in Gujarat and Odisha and it has also achieved self-sufficiency in power.Moreover, JK Paper is expected to see meaningful increase in production resulting from its acquisition of Sirpur Paper Mills. Part of Sirpur’s total capacity of around 1,38,000 tonne per annum (tpa) is expected to come on stream in the first quarter of FY20 on completion of refurbishment of the existing plant.

description,"The RBI could explore introduction of tangible benefits such as income tax incentives based on the digital transactions consumers initiate, while merchants could get GST credits based on the volume of digital payments they accept"
content,"TR RamachandranIndia has made significant progress on its journey towards a less cash society. Though demonetisation gave digital payments a sharp impetus, the secular growth is creditable.At just over 10 percent of PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) being transacted digitally, the journey, however, has just begun. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has played a key catalyst role in the digital payment narrative, with its articulated focus on the five Cs as elaborated in its Vision 2018—Coverage, Convenience, Confidence, Convergence and Cost.To its credit, the RBI has walked the talk, in particular, with initiatives such as interoperability of PPI guidelines, the transition of India’s massive card base to secure EMV chip-based cards and guidelines for tokenization to name a few.Setting up of the Nandan Nilekani committee to recommend steps on Deepening of Digital Payments further highlights the RBI’s intent to accelerate the pace of digital penetration across India. So as the RBI committee continues to solicit industry views, here are some suggestions to widen the net for digital payments in India.Regulate to facilitate growthOpen ecosystems with multiple players mitigate risk by allowing for redundancy, eliminating the single point of failure scenario and spurring competition between payment players, thereby giving rise to innovative product and services as well as enhanced security measures and greater reliability.A competitive payment landscape buoyed by transparent regulatory frameworks will encourage investment and innovation in the private sector. Establishing a level playing field with ‘incentives for all or none’ encourages competition among state-owned, domestic and global players, giving consumers the best choices, value and functionalities. The open and competitive approach adopted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is worth emulating, given its considerable success in driving digital payments through NETS, the local payments brand, and international networks.Technology often moves faster than regulations, as seen in the wake of IoT and cryptocurrencies. It will be fitting to transition to a principles-based regulatory framework, allowing already regulated entities to innovate and co-create solutions, intervening when necessary. Resources can instead be channelled towards fostering consumer protection initiatives, eliminating systemic risks and alleviating potential single points of failure.Security needs to be embedded deep into payment business models. With Indian digital payments expected to touch $1 trillion by 2023, efficient transaction monitoring methods like risk-based authentication is required. Players can then focus on high-risk categories/merchants, suspicious transactions etc., to reduce transaction dropouts and increase payment success rates. Geotagging transactions can also provide behavioural insights to facilitate policy intervention, financial inclusion and more efficient fraud prevention.Regulations may at times stunt creativity, necessitating a regulatory ‘sandbox’ to aid innovation. This environment would, through selective application of otherwise potentially restrictive regulations, promote concept testing and financial services innovation while protecting core customer, financial system and regulatory interests. Such sandboxes in places like the UK and Singapore have pushed over 100 applicants through their systems in just two years.Let payments profitBusinesses will not invest or innovate without the incentive to profit. Market forces determining competitive prices for interchange and Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) will ensure that incentives are spread across participants, negating the need for creative solutions to offset the revenue loss with other charges.With just 4 million acceptance points for a country the size of India, introduction of an Acceptance Infrastructure Development Fund (AIDF) funded by payment players could subsidise acceptance infrastructure costs and motivate banks and other acquirers to accelerate merchant acquiring.Additionally, the regulator could also allow non-banks to acquire merchants, currently exclusive to banks, giving rise to healthy competition. This could reduce acquiring costs and broaden alternatives for end users. Countries such as Poland, Indonesia and Malaysia have successfully rolled out AIDF linked projects to drive digital expansion.Interoperability at scaleInnovations in retail payment markets can raise new questions regarding standardisation. There is a growing challenge for standardisation on a global as well as domestic level, particularly for underlying technical standards. For central banks, the challenge is to ensure an appropriate level of involvement in such activities. Similar to the PPI guidelines, it is time for the RBI to consider interoperability of retail payment systems to ensure quicker adoption and stickiness across consumers and merchants alike.Extending credit to the needy could be as easy as leveraging NBFCs for credit card issuance. This form of financial inclusion will address the limited availability of short-term credit, currently skewed towards affluent segments and Tier 1 cities. It will also diversify the concentration risk in the ecosystem.Mass transit payments will soon become a growth driver for digital payments if given the right direction. Typically, these are low value, repetitive payments whose experience must be seamless, not different from a regular transaction. Enabling open loop, interoperable account-based ticketing will offer consumers the choice to “just turn up and ride”. RBI has been a strong proponent of EMV contactless payments in India; it is only logical then to consider the option of enabling consumers to use their bank-issued debit or credit contactless card for commutes.NoneMake benefits tangible and monetaryCash is seen as a no-cost payment method, though its actual cost is estimated at around $28 billion in India itself. Shifting to digital payments confers a range of benefits, including formalising transaction trails, clamping down on the informal economy and curbing corruption – thereby boosting tax revenue and economic growth. But for the taxpayer, it is an incentive only when he or she benefits directly from it.The RBI could explore the introduction of tangible benefits such as income tax incentives based on the digital transactions consumers initiate, while merchants could get GST credits based on the volume of digital payments they accept. Surcharge removal and MDR subsidies on government payments like taxes, tolls and utility bills could help a large chunk of payments go digital.As the telecom revolution has taught us, we are a nation of digitally savvy consumers. Competitive pricing, easier onboarding, seamless experiences and an incentive to transition are key drivers that continue to be important. We look forward to the views of the Nilekani committee that is expected to come up with the next set of enablers to accelerate the digital payments journey."

title,Explainer | Know your employee group term life insurance cover
datetime,2019-04-26 14:48:00+00:00
description,The premium is paid by employer and a master policy is issued to the employer.
content,"Group term life insurance cover provided by employers is a good retention tool. These policies come with one year term and are renewed every year. Here are a few factors you should know as an employee:Group term life insurance policies (GTL) are issued to groups formed for purposes other than obtaining life insurance. These could be groups of employees of a company, members of a trade organisation and members of associations having a common interest – for example automobile owners association, marathon runners association, etc.Many employers opt for GTL policies to offer life coverage to their employees. Existing employees are covered from the date of issuance of the policy and new employee gets coverage from the date of joining. The coverage offered to employee may vary from organisation to organisation.Some organisations offer flat covers – say Rs 5 lakh per employee. Some organisations choose to offer graded covers, for example – Rs 5 lakh, Rs 10 lakh and Rs 15 lakh for workers, management and top executives, respectively.Some companies offer life cover equivalent to multiple of annul cost to company (CTC) of the employee. If an employee has a CTC of Rs 5 lakh, then applying a multiple of three, he will get a cover of Rs 15 lakh.Many progressive employers mention clearly the amount of life and health cover an employee is entitled to avail in the schedule of benefits attached to appointment letters given to employees.Depending on the size of group, average age of the group, occupation mix, sum assured, past mortality experience and other factors, the premium is ascertained by insurer. The premium is paid by employer and a master policy is issued to the employer.Since premium is borne by the employer, it is an admissible business expense. Hence, employees can’t enjoy tax benefits on the premium paid by the employer on their lives.Each GTL policy typically comes with a free cover limit or no medical limit. This is a peculiar concept seen in group life policies. The limit is ascertained taking into account sum assured, average age and size of group among other factors.Members having sum assured up to the limit get covered automatically. Members above the limit are asked to either sign good health declaration or answer health questionnaire or go for a medical examination or a combination of these.A member failing to clear these underwriting requirements is not denied the life cover. But his sum assured is capped to the free cover limit. For example, if an employer-employee group has a free cover limit of Rs 10 lakh and a member who is entitled for a cover of Rs 50 lakh fails to clear medical examination, then his life cover is capped at Rs 10 lakh."

content,"Moneycontrol ResearchNoneNoneNoneNoneThe core objective behind the exercise was to unlock value in each of the three verticals. Consequently, cash flows and profits from a particular segment would be utilised to fund growth strategies of the respective segment only.NoneA glance at the exhibit suggests that Arvind Fashions was incorrectly quoting at the exchanges ie. at a steep discount to its fair value on the first day of its listing (March 8, 2019). Therefore, Arvind Fashions is expected to stay on an upward trajectory till its appropriate price (in our view, this will be somewhere in the range of Rs 900 – 1,000) is discovered by the Street. It remains to be seen how markets value this coveted business from Arvind Ltd's stable.Notwithstanding the glitch, here's a glance at how the 3 businesses are shaping up:-Arvind Ltd (excluding Anup Engineering and Arvind Fashions)Arvind Ltd's stock price post-demerger (ie. from November 28, 2018 onwards) hasn’t had a good run. Besides market volatlity and weak Q3 numbers, here are a few concerns in the minds of investors that possibly hindered the stock's upmove:-- Overcapacity in denim fabrics, thus resulting in lower utilisation ratesDespite the above-mentioned challenges, the possibility of the stock re-rating in the long-term cannot be ignored if there is a revival in earnings. This, in turn, would depend on the following:-- Increased in-house captive consumption of fabrics for manufacturing apparelAnup EngineeringInvestors have been pretty bullish about the prospects of Anup Engineering because its products are pretty niche and high-margin in nature.NoneBesides being the third largest heavy fabrication player in India, the company caters to clients across specialised sectors such as petrochemicals, oil and gas, fertilisers and power.Its financials are healthy too.NoneIf Anup Engineering keeps delivering high RoCEs (return on capital employed) and generating positive free cash flows (as seen in the past) sustainably, it will command premium valuations.Most stocks in the capital goods space have been plagued with issues such as highly leveraged balance sheets, a weak demand environment and input cost hikes, among others. So, any outperformance by Anup Engineering compared to its peers will, almost certainly, result in a big price upside.Arvind FashionsArvind Fashions has shown consistent improvement in its margins since the past few quarters. This, coupled with a strong portfolio of brands and promising potential of Indian retail, caught the attention of investors. Going forward, here are the factors that will influence the company’s performance:-- Economies of scale and strong private label brands in ‘Unlimited’, the affordable fashion formatIs there any value proposition in store?For investors that held shares of Arvind Ltd pre-demerger and continue to hold them now as well (ie. after the 3 businesses are separately listed), Arvind Fashions will contribute the most in terms of value creation. In the near-term, Arvind Fashions' stock will keep rallying till it reaches its fair price.While Anup Engineering's historical positives are already discounted in the stock's price, Arvind Ltd will have to prove its mettle convincingly.NoneNone"

title,Opinion | How alliances are treating Ramdas Athawale and Prakash Ambedkar
datetime,2019-03-12 13:03:00+00:00
description,"While Ramdas Athawale might be content with just one or two seats in the NDA, Prakash Ambedkar is demanding 22 from the Congress-NCP, which even in an election that might be not as crucial as this one, would be ridiculous."
content,"Sujata AnandanLast year, as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) allies in Maharashtra began to drop off one-by-one, including the smaller parties such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, it looked like the only ally it would be left with was Ramdas Athawale, leader of his own faction of the Republican Party of India (RPI).Athawale began his electoral career as an ally of the Congress, then switched to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). In 2009, he switched back to the Congress to contest the Lok Sabha elections from the temple town of Shirdi, which had become a reserved constituency. He lost and switched to the Shiv Sena hoping to be accommodated in the Rajya Sabha. He finally got the nomination from the BJP, which made him a minister of state for social welfare believing Athawale could deliver the bulk of the Dalit votes from Maharashtra.However, now the BJP has reviewed and revised that assessment. Across India, the party seems to have come to the conclusion that it is not worth allying with any party that cannot help bring it at least five seats to the Lok Sabha.It begged, pleaded, threatened, cajoled and finally persuaded the Shiv Sena, which had determined to go solo, to ally with it precisely for that reason — the Sena could have damaged the BJP’s prospects in at least 20 seats if they were not allies and now in alliance can benefit in about 10 seats. The two parties have divided the 48 seats between themselves — 25 to the BJP and 23 to the Shiv Sena.Athawale was asking for one seat for himself, but, the BJP believes that if he could not win his own seat while contesting on the ticket of a mainstream party such as the Congress, it is not worth giving him a chance. Thus, Athawale, a loyal ally to the BJP, has been thus left out in the cold and does not know which way to turn. He has burnt his bridges with both the Congress and the NCP and cannot hope the Shiv Sena will accommodate him when he is already a BJP ally.The ruling party can afford to ignore Athawale for there has been a lot of unrest among Dalits about his alliance with the BJP given its recent run-ins with the community across India: from the Una unrest in Gujarat to their initial indifference to the Supreme Court modifying the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,1989, from the BJP’s position on Bhima Koregaon where they gave support to the upper castes against Dalits, to their attempt to deny reservations in universities to Dalits (this was hastily corrected with an ordinance).In Maharashtra, the only other Dalit leader of consequence is Prakash Ambedkar (the grandson of BR Ambedkar) who has fought the government bitterly over Bhima Koregaon and has a little following, though even that does not amount to much electorally. He has recently formed the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, an umbrella organisation for all deprived classes, and has an alliance with Asaduddin Owaisi's All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-e Muslimeen (AIMIM).The Congress and the NCP are willing to accommodate Ambedkar but he is overambitious. The Congress-NCP are proposing he contest from Akola in Vidarbha, which he represented in 1998. Then he was one of the three Dalit leaders — the other two being Jogendra Kawade and the late RS Gavai — who Sharad Pawar worked hard to have elected from open seats. Usually Dalits vote for upper castes but it is very difficult to get the upper castes to vote for Dalits. However, Pawar pulled off victories of all three Dalit candidates from open category seats. It was unprecedented and that is why remarkable.Since then Ambedkar has contested Akola several times but failed to make the grade. Now while Athawale, the more firebrand leader among the two, might be content with just one or two seats, Ambedkar is demanding 22 from the Congress-NCP. Which even in an election that might be not as crucial as this one, would be ridiculous. Ensuring that Ambedkar wins from his own seat would be an uphill task for the Congress-NCP. Though the Congress-NCP alliance does not have a five seat policy like the BJP, it is unlikely that they would give away more seats to a party that cannot win a single seat on its own.Ambedkar’s intransigence is now being seen as not just greed but a conspiracy in view of his alliance with the AIMIM, which is largely perceived as the flip side of the BJP, by cutting into the Congress’s vote-bank.It’s an irony in Indian politics that while one Dalit leader (Athawale) whose demands are minimal is being spurned by a mainstream party (BJP), the other Dalit leader (Ambedkar) whose demands are exaggerated is trying to be accommodated by another mainstream party (Congress).Sujata Anandan is a senior journalist and author.

content,"Moneycontrol ResearchHighlights:NoneThe food and beverages colour industry — a niche segment of the dyes and pigment industry — not only benefits from growth in the end market (FMCG sector) but also has significant barriers to entry, due to its highly regulated business. As a result, the industry has an oligopolistic structure, where only a few companies are up the scale in terms of technical knowhow and quality control.NoneMeasuring opportunity sizeThe size of the global food and beverages colour market is estimated to be about USD 1.1 billion, with half contributed by natural food colours and the other half by synthetic food colours. It is relatively small compared to the global dyes and dye intermediates market of about USD 4 billion, but the prospects of the food colour business are underpinned by relatively steady growth trends.Market researchers forecast mid to high single digit CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in the medium term driven by regulatory requirements, urbanization and structural demand drivers for the food and beverage industry.Table: Market sizeNoneNoneTable: Select companies capacityNoneSource: CompanyKey global manufacturers of food colors are Sensient Technology Corporation, CHR Hansen, GNT and Roha Dyechem and Dynemic Products.Vidhi Specialty, a leading player in the synthetic colours market, faces competition from Sensient and Roha Dyechem.NoneThe use of colours in food is closely regulated and varies from region to region. It is reported that about 14 colours are permitted for use in food in Europe, 6 in USA and 8 in India. Roha Dyechem says there are some colours permitted in Europe, USA but not allowed in India (like Allura). So continuously maintaining various approvals (BIS, FDA, EU & WHO) and certifications (Kosher & Halal) backed by an appropriate lab with testing facilities is an ongoing requirement.Why do we prefer Vidhi Specialty?1.Change in operating model – Earnings accretiveVidhi’s business model has transformed over the last one year. It has pursued debottlenecking initiatives which has increased its production efficiency to about 300 tons per month from 225 tons earlier. In addition, its sales mix has changed as Vidhi has cut down its reliance on trading.In FY17, trading accounted for 45 percent of sales which has reduced to about 29 percent now. On account of this two-pronged strategy while the company’s topline has been steady, operating margins have increased significantly. Sales for the first nine months of FY19 have increased by a steady 7 percent but EBITDA has surged by 49 percent on YoY basis. Note that the gross margin for Sensient’s colour division of Sensient is still way above Vidhi’s, at about 42 percent.Table: FinancialsNoneSource: Company2. Targeting more than 2x turnover CY 2020The company plans to double turnover to Rs 500 crore in CY 2020 (vs Sales of Rs 212 crore in FY18).

The company’s capex plan appears on track and it is looking forward to getting the environmental clearance.As per September 2018 numbers, the company’s debt is lower by 40 percent compared to the level at the end of FY17 leading to Debt/Equity ratio of 0.41x (down from 0.94x). Management expects to retire its debt in the current fiscal before new working capital related need arises for the expanded facility.Ninety five per cent of Vidhi’s sales of manufactured products caters to the overseas markets.

datetime,2019-03-13 17:27:00+00:00
description,"Sections within the BJP had reportedly opposed Sujay's entry into the party, arguing that if he is to be given a ticket, he should contribute to the party's growth"
content,"NoneFor one thing, Sujay is 'big fish', being the son of an LoP and a senior Congress leader in the state. Secondly, the BJP has managed to score on the rivalry between allies Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).According to reports, Sujay's switch to the BJP was a result of an old family feud, and the tussle between Congress and NCP over one seat: Ahmednagar constituency.The seeds of political rivalry between the Vikhe Patil and Pawar clans started with Sujay's grandfather Eknathrao, a towering leader and Union Minister who was known as Balasaheb in political circles.Eknathrao controlled Maharashtra's oldest sugar cooperative factory in Ahmednagar's Loni region, started by his father Vitthalrao, and was close to the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shankarrao Chavan.In a state where the wheels of power are turned by leaders' hold over sugar cooperatives, Chavan had reportedly tried to check the influence of Vasantdada Patil, another senior Congress leader in the state and Pawar, who was a part of Congress then. While Pawar and Eknathrao sparred in public, they reportedly continued to cultivate contacts with each others' rivals in the background, particularly in Ahmednagar.The seat has been subject to not just political but also legal battles. For instance, in 1991, contesting as rebel Congress candidate, Eknathrao contested on the seat and lost, but went on to legally challenge Pawar— who was then the Chief Minister—accusing him of resorting to corrupt electoral practices to make the Congress candidate win. The battle went to the Supreme Court, where Pawar was cleared of all charges.The rivalry spilled over to the next generations as well. In 2011, with the Congress government in power in the state, Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Corporation (MERC), falling under the control of then power minister Ajit Pawar— Sharad Pawar's nephew—took away electricity distribution rights from Mula Pravara Society, an electricity cooperative in Ahmednagar owned by the Vikhe Patil family. The reason given was that it owes the state Rs 2,200 crore, but according to reports, the move was perceived as a continuance of the old family rivalry.That was 2011, and, eight years later, the feud still seems to be simmering. According to reports, Sujay was adamant about contesting from Ahmednagar, while the NCP wanted to field its own candidate in the seat. This was one of the reasons, according to reports, that the seat-sharing arrangement between Congress-NCP had been delayed. The senior Vikhe Patil, Radhakrishna, had made an appeal to Pawar to consider Sujay as his grandson, but Ajit had announced that ""there was no question of the NCP relinquishing the Ahmednagar seat to the Congress""."

title,"Ahead of Lok Sabha polls, here's why 33% reservation for women is a masterstroke from Naveen Patnaik"
datetime,2019-03-13 17:34:00+00:00
description,"Days after Patnaik's announcement, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee announced that she has reserved 41 percent seats for women from her party"
content,"NoneFor Patnaik, reservation for women has been a pet issue, and the 72-year-old satrap has been batting for 33 percent reservation for women in Parliament and state assemblies for a long time. Reports have suggested that while this is a step in the right direction, as far as representation of women in politics is concerned, observers noted that this is also a calculative step keeping in mind Patnaik's core voter base— Odisha's 200 lakh women population— ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.While other parties have, over the years, targeted the women voter base by handing out doles like the Ujjwala scheme (Bharatiya Janata Party), promises of passing the Women's Reservation Bill and providing free healthcare and education (Congress), Patnaik has carved a dedicated constituency for himself in Odisha.Patnaik has established a network of self-help groups (SHGs) in the state, particularly focusing on the state's rural areas. 'Mission Shakti', as the campaign came to be called, has now managed to establish over 6 lakh SHGs across Odisha. This, in turn, has helped over 60 lakh women in getting bank loans and setting up of their own enterprises, writes journalist Ruben Banerjee in his biography of Patnaik.NoneThe result reflects during polls: for instance, during the 2014 elections in Odisha, where both assembly and Lok Sabha polls happen simultaneously, Patnaik retained power authoritatively, winning 20 of the 21 Parliamentary seats and 116 of the 147 assembly seats. Over 74 percent women in Odisha voted during that election.Patnaik is not the first member of his clan to reserve seats for women. His father, former Odisha Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, had started the practice by announcing 33 percent reservation for women in panchayat raj institutions and government jobs, a first then. In 2012, Patnaik had increased the percentage to 50. The Odisha CM has been applauded for his efforts, most recently by the United Nations, which commended Patnaik's ""thought leadership"" in a letter.None""If they match BJD's move only in Odisha and not across the nation, they will look as cynical opportunists. Both will not be able to make that announcement even in Odisha,"" the MP said. Another reason might be the unpopularity of sitting MPs and legislators, who might have to be moved out, and tickets will be given to their female family members instead.None"

According to the company, the lamps look like ordinary chrome strips when switched off, but become 'dramatically lit' when switched on.The roofline flows seamlessly down to the back to end sharply over the boot lid. The rear diffuser too is aggressively styled and the tail lamps run across the width of the car.NoneFor the inside, the new Sonata gets a dual-tone dashboard finish with beige leather and grey plastics. At the centre console is a large touchscreen infotainment unit paired to a Bose sound system. The system is adaptive and changes the equaliser settings according to the speed of the car.

content,"It was earlier reported by the Press Trust of India (PTI) that aviation regulator DGCA could bar beleaguered carrier Jet Airways from taking advance bookings beyond a particular period.The move was believed to have been initiated amid a drastically reduced capacity and massive flight cancellations, an news agency had quoted an official as saying.However, Moneycontrol spoke to sources at Jet Airways, who confirmed that the carrier had not received any intimation from the DGCA about not accepting advance bookings.The PTI report claimed that the official said, Jet Airways has been flying only 61 of the 116 planes it has in the fleet, forcing it to cancel as much as 45 percent of its total flights per day.Jet Airways operates over 600 flights within Indian and overseas.""We may ask Jet Airways not to accept forward bookings beyond a particular period,"" a senior DGCA official told PTI on March 14.The comments came in the wake of the full service carrier announcing on its website sale at an starting all-inclusive fares of Rs 1,165 for travel to 37 domestic destinations with one-year travel period validity under a discount scheme.For record, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) had taken a similar action against budget carrier SpiceJet in late 2014 when it was on the verge of closure.At that time, it allowed SpiceJet to sell tickets only for travel within a month.The official also said that a final decision on the issue will be taken after seeking a report from Jet Airways.Meanwhile, the DGCA will review flight schedule of the cash-starved carrier at a meeting on March 15.A senior official last month said the DGCA is reviewing the airline's flights schedule every 15 days in order to ensure that there are no sudden flight disruptions due to grounding of aircraft.In addition to offering flight tickets at starting fares as low as Rs 1,165, the airline is also offering 10 percent discount on flight bookings for four or more passengers travelling together, as per Jet Airways website.It has, however, not given any cut-off date for booking tickets under the offer.""The tickets are valid for 12 months from the date of commencement of journey,"" according to the website.The Naresh Goyal-promoted carrier has been looking at various ways to raise funds amid acute liquidity crunch that has forced it to ground aircraft, cancel flights in large numbers, shut down stations and delay salary payments to its pilots and engineers along with other senior staff.On March 8, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal wrote to Etihad Airways Group CEO Tony Douglas seeking an urgent funding of Rs 750 crore under an MoU signed between various stakeholders.In the letter, Goyal also said ""Jet Airways is in a very precarious position, with more than 50 aircraft grounded and increasing arrears of vendors and salaries which makes the need for interim funding all the more imperative.""Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA): Story regarding DGCA asking Jet Airways not to accept advance bookings is factually incorrect.

But less female marketers are convinced with the way they're portraying men in the advertisements, it said.It observed that getting the gender placement right is important, especially from a digital and static perspective because it can be used as a targeting and optimisation variable in these channels.It also noted that new information has the highest receptivity in India, more than 50 percent men and women become more positive towards the ads that have new information.This is closely followed by humour which has a critical role to play in improving the ad receptivity with both genders.""The report highlights that the bulk of ads in India are targeted at women; but marketers appear to be targeting them led more by stereotypes. Gender targeting should not be an either or decision and we need to challenge these outdated assumptions. From a portrayals perspective, more emphases need to be made towards aspirational and authoritative roles."

content,"Days after Royal Enfield teased the world with images of their scramblers; the Indian motorcycle manufacturer has announced the official launch date of the Trials twins, which will be March 27. Carrying forward the iconic 350 and 500cc engines, the Trials 350 and Trials 500 bear a resemblance to their Classic siblings, but with an off-road bias.The Trials derive most of their parts from the Classic 350 and 500, like the fuel tank. However, Royal Enfield has made some changes to make the bike better suited for the off-road. One of the most prominent of them is the raised handlebar, which is also a little wider than its Classic counterpart.  This has been done to facilitate better manoeuvrability. The Trials also miss out on a pillion seat and its surrounding accessories, though it is replaced with a luggage rack. One more noticeable difference is the exhaust, which is tall and upswept rather than the long and straight one found in their Classic counterparts. This will significantly improve the water-wading abilities of the motorcycle.The bike is held up on telescopic forks in the front and dual rear shocks at the rear. It also has single disc brakes on both the wheels. Dual-channel ABS is expected to come as standard. The wheels are also asymmetrical, like the Classics, with 19-inch spoked wheels in the front and 18-inch spoked wheels at the rear. However, they are shod with dual-purpose knobby tires for off-roading."

This means a Permanent Account Number (PAN) is mandatory for every investor KYC.Poor performance""Lacklustre performance across equity scheme categories in the past one-year, where majority of large cap funds, mid cap funds, small cap funds, multi cap funds, have under-performed their respective benchmark indices. As a result, those who started SIPs towards the end of 2017 haven't made much money in last 12-15 months,"" said a fund manager from a private fund house.Large-cap, mid-cap and small cap mutual fund categories have delivered negative returns in the range of 4-10 percent in the last one year.In terms of net SIPs, which is new SIP registered minus discontinued SIPs, the numbers are falling even faster. In fact, in February 2018, the industry added just 2.58 lakh net new SIP accounts, compared with 2.62 lakh accounts in January, as per AMFI.AMFI data also reveals that the number of SIP discontinuations have increased in the current financial year compared to FY18.In FY18, the total discontinuation of SIP accounts stood at 34.83 lakh, while in 11 months of FY19, this number has already touched 52.99 lakh.On the other hand, the number of new SIPs registered in FY18 was 116.41 lakh, while until February, 100.67 lakh news SIPs were registered.MF DATAInflows into equity funds, including equity linked saving schemes, have declined 17 percent on a month-on-month (MoM) basis to Rs 5,122 crore in February.Monthly equity inflows have come off significantly from the high of Rs 20,308 crore seen in November 2017."

She sat on the steps of the parliament building demanding the government undertake radical response to climate change.After the country’s parliamentary elections in September 2018, she would spend four days a week at school and reserve her Fridays for protesting on the steps of the parliament building. She said that she was inspired by the protests staged by American high-school students against gun laws in response to the Parkland shooting in 2018.A curious mind, Greta had developed interest in climate change when she was nine years old and in her third grade. Her parents – Svante Thunberg, an actor and Malena Ernman, a very-well known Opera singer –  have shown unconditional support to their daughter and the cause of climate change.In a book, Ernmen mentions that Greta and her younger sister Beata have been diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. Greta attributes her special interest and her uncanny ability to concentrate to her autism. She began doing research on climate change when she was only nine and has stayed on the topic for seven years.So attached she is to the cause and the belief that a small change can lead to a large difference, something known as the Butterfly Effect, that Greta has stopped eating meat and buying anything that is not absolutely necessary.

They have an electric car, which they use only when necessary, and ride bikes for relatively short distances.Sweden is said to have the most progressive legislation on climate change with its policies aiming to make the Nordic nation “the first fossil-free welfare state in the world”. In addition, the country is a signatory to the scientific census that countries must cut their emissions by 15 percent a year.Calling the progressive legislation and scientific consensus “bu****it”, Greta says that in Sweden actual commissions had gone up by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018.NoneNone"

Starting in 2010, the company began disclosing numbers on a financial year basis.For HUL, sales in those five years grew at 5.71 percent on a compounded annual growth rate basis from Rs 20,457.95 crore to Rs 27,003.99 crore. In comparison, its peers such as Dabur, Emami and Marico fared far better (21.2/22.4/19.2 percent sales CAGR from FY08 to FY13, respectively), albeit on a significantly lower revenue base.Between 2013 to 2017, he was the president of Unilever's Home Care business and joined the Unilever Leadership Executive. Figures for home care business are not available for FY13 since the company did not disclose it. For this segment, HUL began reporting numbers only from FY17.He was appointed as President of Unilever's foods and refreshment business and member of the Unilever Leadership Executive January 1, 2018. Revenues from the foods and refreshment segment stood at Rs 6,925 crore from January – December 2018, up 10.3 percent during the same period in 2017.Under his leadership, HUL acquired GSK Consumer in December 2018. By virtue of the deal, the Horlicks brand came under HUL’s umbrella, thereby enabling it to strengthen its positioning in the healthy food drinks segment. Foods & Refreshment (F&R) division constituted 18.4 percent of HUL’s net sales for 9M FY19. With this merger, F&R revenues are likely to scale up to more than Rs 11,000 crore, which will be approximately 28 percent of HUL’s post-merger sales.Unilever’s new bet signifies the trust that the company has in Paranjpe.""Today’s increasingly fragmented consumer, channel and media environment requires us to operate with more speed and agility than ever before. With his deep knowledge and experience of our markets, Nitin is ideally placed to work with me and the Unilever Leadership Executive to drive our performance and help deliver our growth ambitions,” said Unilever CEO Alan Jope in a statement to the exchangesJourney with Unilever, HULParanjpe joined Unilever in 1987, as a management trainee in its Indian subsidiary. In his early years, he performed different roles across marketing and customer development.Subsequently, he moved to London to work as Assistant to the Unilever Chairman and then returned to lead the Laundry and Household Care categories in India before joining the management committee of the Indian business in 2006 as head of the Home and Personal Care business.Paranjpe has a degree in mechanical engineering and an MBA in marketing from the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai."

title,Bank Nifty gains 10% in March: Here's what is driving the rally in banking stocks
datetime,2019-03-15 15:06:00+00:00
description,Bank Nifty rallied 10 percent in March and Financial Services index climbed around 8 percent against more than 5 percent gains in Nifty50.
content,"Banking and financial services stocks have been key drivers of the current rally that has led benchmark indices to fresh six-month highs. The up move has been fuelled by hopes of Modi's return at the Centre and renewed FII inflow.Bank Nifty has rallied 10 percent in March so far and financial services index has climbed around 8 percent in comparison to Nifty's over 5 percent gain.NoneNoneToday, Bank Nifty gained more than a percent to hit a record high of 29,488 intraday, driven by Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 4.4 percent), Bank of Baroda (up 2.5 percent), PNB (2.3 percent), SBI (1.8 percent) and ICICI Bank (1.5 percent). Nifty Financial Service index also climbed over a percent.Table: intraday stock pricesNoneAnother reason which could be supporting growth in Bank Nifty is credit growth. Systemic credit growth has recovered to a five-year-high of around 14 percent, while deposit growth remains modest at 10 percent.Motilal Oswal expects credit growth to remain strong, given the improving economic parameters and rising share of banks in the total credit needs of the economy.""Key beneficiaries of this trend will be lenders with strong liability franchisee, as it will allow smooth flow of funds at reasonable costs,"" it said.On analysing key trends, the brokerage noted that private banks' share in total deposits has increased to 27 percent from 18.6 percent in FY14, and CASA market share of private banks has increased from 21.7 percent in FY14 to 28.8 percent, while the share of banks offering differential savings account rates has increased to 5 percent from 1.4 percent in FY14.Jan Dhan deposits formed 9 percent of incremental SA deposits for PSU banks, it said.Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued 12 banking licences (including SFBs) over the past five years, as against 12 licenses in the preceding 20 years.""This has allowed conversion of many non-bank lenders into banks and enabled them access to stable and low-cost liabilities. Recent funding issues in the financial sector have again stressed the need of the liability franchisee. This consideration will drive M&As, going forward. The RBI, too, will step in support of such moves,"" Motilal Oswal said.On March 13, the Reserve Bank of India had said it would inject long-term liquidity worth $5 billion into the system through foreign exchange swap arrangement with banks for three years, to meet the durable liquidity needs of the system.Overall, analysts remain positive on banking space as they expect asset quality to improve further in FY20 which may help them to report strong earnings.""Over the past four-five years, focus of Indian financial system has largely been on handling corporate stress and increasing lending to retail. However, we now believe this is poised to reverse,"" Edelweiss said."

content,"Schott Kaisha, the Indo-German joint venture that makes tubular ampoules, vials, glass syringes and cartridges used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics is investing over Rs 500 crore to set up new facilities and expand existing ones.The expansion is driven by demand from Indian drug makers that are increasingly launching injectable drugs domestically and overseas.The company has two plants in Daman and Jambusar near Vadodara and plans to add new facilities in Daman and Baddi.The company said it plans to start work on a new facility in Daman by end of this year and the Baddi facility in the next few months.The company said the Baddi facility is meant to be closer to the North Indian market, where Chinese manufacturers are holding sway.The company, which has invested Rs 250 crore on Jambusar site, said nine lines are under production and nine more will come under production by end of this year.The company is investing a couple of million euros on each line at the Jambusar unit.It is also in the process of modernising and consolidating its existing facility in Daman.“We are seeing an exponential growth after a slowdown two-three years back,” said Rishad Dadachanji, Managing Director of Kaisha Lifesciences in an interview to Moneycontrol.Schott Kaisha's revenue grew 38 percent in FY18 and company is in line to beat the growth this year.The products Schott Kaisha makes are used to package injectables and sterile solutions.“All companies are coming back from regulatory problems, they have been vigorously filing ANDAs. The approvals are granted much quicker by USFDA,” Dadachanji said on reasons leading to growth.Indian companies are chasing low competition-high margin generic injectable drugs, compared to generic oral solids which tend to become commoditized over a short period of time.In addition to USFDA approvals, Dadachanji says the growth is also coming from innovative drugs and formulations such as biosimilars, cancer drugs and vaccines. For instance, the move from the oral polio vaccine to inactivated polio vaccines (IPV) that comes in injectable form has created huge demand."

title,"Here's how you can lock your losses, safeguard profits by using Options"
datetime,2019-03-16 09:17:00+00:00
description,Violent moves do tend to push the premiums higher but it is always prudent to keep away from shorting Options in the direction of volatility.
content,"Shubham AgarwalThere have been a lot of discussions about how to optimally monetise the potential opportunities using Options. Well, with the market on a spur, let us take a moment to discuss how one can withhold these gains.One of the best ways to withhold these gains is by using Options in the unfavourable direction.Similarly, for every fresh trade after a big move up, one may find a need to be prudent. Once again, here is an additional leg of option monetising, the unfavorable direction would be a good idea.For example, X stock is trading at Rs 100. We buy the stock in course of time it moves up to Rs 110, now to lock the profits a 110 Put can be bought.Buy a Put option would hedge any unfavourable outcome from that price point. If the price starts moving lower or below Rs 110, then the Put option would at least partially compensate for losses on the original position.Similarly, if one were to create a position in X stock at the price point of 110. The strategy would be to go for a Long position in 110 Put alongside a Long in underlying via Futures or Cash equity.These situations are quite common in moves, post important breakouts. As one can see, while in the first case the Long Put alongside locks the profit already made, the second one makes a prudent attempt at locking any additional losses over and above the sunk cost of the long Put.Executing this is very simple as the second case would be the initial step in a rising market. While one assumes the sunk cost and holds on to the position through the thick and thin over the course of the expiry, there is scope for one improvisation.The improvisation is simple, in case the stock starts moving in a favourable direction, bring the Put strike up, thereby once again locking the gain up to the Put strike.It's a lossmaking exercise on the Put but using Put options put us in an overall gaining state.Carrying forward with the same example if after initiation at 110 along with 110 Put long at 2 does actually materialises and the stock moves up to 113, wise step would be to square off the 110 Put at whatever price it is and create a fresh long position in 113 Put (provided the strike exists) at 2.Finally, one caveat is the violent moves do tend to push the premiums higher but it is always prudent to keep away from shorting Options in the direction of volatility.Meaning, I would refrain from selling 115 Call at 110. As this exercise would not limit my profits instead of locking them.The same theory holds good when we are falling apart and a short position is created and a Long Call is kept to lock the losses and lock the profits.The author is CEO & Head of Research at Quantsapp Private Limited."

title,What is postal ballot and proxy voting
datetime,2019-03-15 16:18:00+00:00
description,Both allow certain voters to exercise their Right to Adult Franchise from a distance.
content,"The government of India has provisions for allowing its citizens to cast vote during an election in three different ways: In person, by post, and through a proxy.While in-person voting obviously involves the voter to be physically present at the polling booth, the other two allows certain voters to exercise their Right to Adult Franchise from a distance.Proxy voting allows a registered elector to delegate his voting rights to a representative he nominates. This was introduced in 2003 for very few countries to have such a provision. Notably, only “classified service voter” serving in the armed forces or paramilitary forces is allowed to avail of these benefits; the proxy, too, must be a registered voter of the same constituency.Postal ballots, on the other hand, involves votes being sent by post. The rights are reserved for people deputed in election duties at places away from his or her constituency, or for armed force personnel, the armed police force of a state serving in another state, ambassadors and high commissioners and their staff. The spouses of the above-mentioned electorate can also enjoy these benefits.Nowadays, one can download blank post ballot sent to them electronically, mark their preference and send back the filled-up ballot paper to the election official.Need for proxy voting is being heavily discussed once again as the country goes to polls from April 11. Many (non-resident Indians) NRIs have been urging the government to grant them the right to cast proxy votes in the constituencies where they are registered."

This results in extended end-of-season-sale periods and difficulties in passing on high raw material costs- Change in e-commerce FDI guidelines in December 2018 is likely to impact discounts and exclusive offerings on Amazon and Flipkart- Inability to normalise advertisement spends (as a percentage of sales) and low inventory turns could dent marginsPeer comparisonA glance at the exhibits below indicates that AFL’s financials have shown significant improvement in the last 2-3 years, with revenues growing by more than 20 percent YoY.

description,"The company is said to be eyeing assets in the power sector, both within and outside the insolvency courts "
content,"NoneNoneThe JSW Steel Group-firm has shown interest in acquiring some of the assets in the sector, and this will be crucial to gain ground and challenge its top three peers.But Jain, JSW Energy's Joint MD and CEO, is not in a hurry to press that deal button.""There are a few variables that still have to fall in place. Once that happens, we can take a call,"" says Jain, sitting in the second floor meeting room at  the group headquarters in Mumbai.That would be the right moment to put to practice the 90 seconds test, which Jain swears by. ""I take 99 percent of the decisions in 90 seconds. The answer has to be that obvious. For rest of the one percent of the decisions, I leave them,"" says the 47-year-old.The test has kept him in good stead, and Jain would hope to continue that, especially given the comfortable seat that JSW Energy occupies. While most of its peers are struggling to repay debts, and some have reached the insolvency courts, the company has a comfortable cash position and its debt-to-equity ratio is less than one. A rating less than one is considered prudent.In contrast to the financial health of the companies, the industry continues to have a positive outlook, growing at nearly seven percent a year, and demand is coming back on the back of slow capacity addition.These conditions make it a good time to take out that shopping bag, and Jain accepts that JSW Energy would want to play an 'active role' in the industry's consolidation. But there are a few conditions.The company will not veer away from some of its basic criteria to make an acquisition -- the cost of production of power should be low, and it wants to focus on companies that have long-term power purchasing agreements.Jain is tight-lipped on the assets he is eyeing. But underlines, ""We want to create value for all our stakeholders and thus we don't want to hurry, but want to follow the process. If we had wanted, we could have taken a plunge and then faced the odds one by one. But we don't want to do that.""None""I had to break my personal savings,"" recalls Jain, who had been fascinated with the financial markets since his mechanical engineering days in Agra. The Meerut-born Jain had in fact used his savings, after landing a job at DCM Shriram Industries, to invest in an initial public offering (IPO).While that investment had paid off, this one in 2000, brought him close to bankruptcy. ""I learnt a lesson. One, to do my homework thoroughly. And second, never to over leverage myself,"" says Jain, who shifted from Tarapur to Mumbai, when JSW Steel Group Chairman Sajjan Jindal picked him to be his Executive Assistant.Jain has put that learning to use. Now he studies balance sheets of companies for up to six months before taking a decision to invest in a stock. Sundays are spent going through annual reports. And he is equally careful when to cash in. ""There are stocks that I have held on since 2010,"" says Jain.The professional has also picked up tips from Jindal, whom Jain considers his mentor. During his initial days as Jindal's Executive Assistant, Jain couldn't cope up with his boss' penchant for numbers. ""Jindal could reel off numbers from memories, so I spent time mugging up tables to catch up,"" he quipped.Apart from the mental rigour, Jain follows Jindal's lead in being physically agile too. He spends an hour at the gym on weekdays, and extends them by another 30 minutes on weekends. ""I do a 90 kg dead lift (a weight training exercise). But Jindal does 110 kg,"" he adds.NoneInorganic growth adds one more layer to it.NoneThe cautious stance was also visible in group flagship JSW Steel's strategy for distressed assets in the steel sector. The company was in fray for Bhushan Steel, but didn't go overboard in its bid after squaring off with Tata Steel, which eventually bought the firm."

However, much has changed since then with Icardi not playing for over a month due to a standoff with the owners over a contract renewal.AC Milan on the other hand have made a great start to 2019 by picking up 23 points from a possible 30, which reignites their hopes of making it into next season’s Champions League.The signing of Krzysztof Piatek from Genoa is one of the major reasons for the spectacular turnaround for Milan. The Polish striker has already matched Gonzalo Higuain’s Serie A tally of 6 goals which were scored in the first-half of the season, and is expected to double that total by the end of the season. The 23-year-old has definitely proven to be the lethal finisher that Milan were lacking all season.Inter on the other hand have been struggling, picking up just 11 points from their previous 8 matches in the Serie A. They were even dumped out of the Europa League in midweek following a 1-0 defeat to minnows Eintracht Frankfurt.Off the pitch, things aren’t looking good for Inter with reports suggesting that manager Luciano Spalleti will be axed by the end of the season. The long-standing rift with their star player Icardi isn’t helping matters too. Icardi has been out of action with complaints of a knee problem despite the team doctors giving him the all clear. The Argentinean has five goals in 10 Milan derbies including scoring the winner in two of the last three derby ties.A win for AC Milan will keep them within touching distance of Napoli in second position while a defeat will see rivals Inter Milan leapfrog them to occupy third spot by a two point margin. A defeat for Inter Milan however, could see them level on points with Roma, who are very much in contention for the fourth and final Champions League qualifying spot on the table.Team NewsTiemoue Bakayoko missed AC Milan’s 2-1 win over Chievo last weekend but could return to face Inter. Ricardo Rodriguez is also available for selection after missing the last game due to suspension and will most likely replace Diego Laxalt in the starting XI.Winger Hakan Calhanoglu missed the match against Chievo as he flew to Germany to witness the birth of his child but will be expected to be in the starting XI against Inter.For Inter Milan, it seems unlikely that Icardi will return for the derby tie. Marcelo Brozovic has been out with a muscular problem, but is expected to return along with Matias Vecino, who was serving a one-match suspension. Radja Nainggolan remains out over an injury.Possible XINoneNonePlayers to watch out for:Krzysztof PiatekNoneThe Pole has transformed the fortunes of the club since completing his 30 million pounds signing in January. He has 8 goals in 8 starts for Milan and will be expected to pounce on any opportunity provided to him in his very first Milan derby.Marcelo BrozovicNoneThe Croatian midfielder will be fit again to join the squad and Inter will be pleased to have him running the show from midfield. Inter haven’t lost a Serie A derby for the past 3 years, and will be hoping to maintain that record with Brozovic providing some much-needed solidity on midfield.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneWhere to watch:The match will be beamed live on the Sony Pictures Sports Network, and will begin at 1.00 AM IST on March 18.

title,Pharma wrap: India's predicament of controlling patented anti-cancer medicine prices
datetime,2019-03-17 08:32:00+00:00
description,The spiralling costs of patented cancer drugs has come to focus with governments in the developed and developing world grappling to deal with the problem.
content,"Indian government recently capped the trade margins of 42 non-scheduled anti-cancer drugs sold under 463 brands to 30 percent.The move, while partially addresses the problem of high prices of generic anti-cancer medications, leaves behind patented cancer drugs.The spiralling costs of patented cancer drugs has come to focus with governments in the developed and developing world grappling to deal with it.A study done by Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta titled ‘Impact of Product Patents on Pharmaceutical Market Structure and Prices’ found that the proportion of monopoly molecules (cancer drugs) sales has increased from 6.4 percent during 2000 to 2004 to 18.8 percent during 2010 to 2012 and to 59.5 percent during 2013 to 2015.The molecules with two brands account for about two-thirds of the market during 2013 to 2015. It is a very common practice for innovator companies to in license molecules to Indian companies for distributing their products in domestic market.In this backdrop comes a blanket statement from Vinod K Paul, a key member of government's policy think tank NITI Aayog.None“In principle, it is a discovery and we should respect the innovation,” he added.​Paul, the chief architect of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship health scheme Ayushman Bharat and chairman of expert committee on pharma pricing that advises National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) is an influential voice these days. The government’s decision on cancer drugs last week was based on the recommendations of this panel.The statement from Paul is a departure from the past, when government officials avoided voicing views on patented drugs in public, given the sensitivities involved.Let's take look at how patents assumed so much prominence in Indian context.BackgroundIn 2005, India amended its Patents Act, 1970 to introduce product patents in line with Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, disbanding its liberal patent regime that only identified process patents.India grants patents to product or a process that is new, involving inventive step and capable of industrial application.The patent term is 20 years from the date of filing, in essence it provides exclusivity of those many years to commercially exploit a product.In the developed world, patents are used as a carrot to incentivise innovation and help recoup costs related to research and development of drugs.There was firm opposition especially from Left Front parties against TRIPS agreement, on grounds that product patents will lead to monopolies and make lifesaving drugs unaffordable.Also there was resistance from domestic pharmaceutical industry that thrived on process patent and by reverse engineering drugs, helping India becoming the pharmacy of the world for cheap copycat drugs.TRIPS agreement did offer a flexibility in form of a provision for compulsory licensing to overturn patents in cases of national emergency and health crisis.India used this flexibility once by granting compulsory license in 2012 to Natco Pharma for the generic production of Bayer's Nexavar.Bayer at that time was selling Nexavar used in treatment of liver and kidney cancers for Rs 2.8 lakh for a month’s treatment. Natco offered to sell the copy at Rs 8,800, agreeing to pay 6 percent of net sales as royalty to Bayer. The Indian Patent Office’s verdict to give compulsory license sparked outrage. Governments in the developed world accused India of failing to protect intellectual property rights.To be sure, not all patents are genuine innovations. Some are just tweaks of formulation, dosage or combination that are intended at times to extend patent exclusivities, often termed as patent ever greening.The Indian patent law did have protection from this. India inserted a clause -- Section 3(d) -- in the Indian Patent Act 1970 that does not allow patents to be granted to inventions involving new forms of a known substance unless it differs significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.Compulsory licensing and Section 3(d), among others are often cited reasons by US Trade Representative (USTR) in keeping India in its priority watch list, that keeps track of countries accused as patent violators, who may potentially end up facing trade sanctions, if they do not act.Time to exercise cautionBoth, US and Germany, have invoked compulsory licensing in recent years, and US President Donald Trump had talked about plans to negotiate prices of drugs for Medicare and Medicaid programmes, all these aimed to reduce the burden on their patients and payers.Patents are useful in encouraging innovation, but what purpose they serve, if large number of patients cannot afford the innovation and keep suffering and dying.The classic solution often advanced is a universal health insurance to address the problem of accessibility. That does not hold much water as the experience of US government shows that cost of drugs has pushed the overall cost of healthcare, burdening the people and the government.It is also documented that several top selling patented drugs, have come from public funded research laboratories and sometimes heavily subsidised by the governments through grants and giving them orphan drug status or fast tracking them requiring lesser subjects for clinical trials. Many times the prices of drugs just does not match up with the cost of development.Such blanket statement may not help our cause, at a time when India is under tremendous pressure to dilute hard fought flexibilities and provisions offered under Indian Patents Act to protect patients."

Though it never won a Lok Sabha seat, in 2014 elections it was blown away during the Narendra Modi wave.In the assembly elections held that year, the MNS won only one seat in Maharashtra. Recently, that lone MLA from Junnar in Pune district has joined the Shiv Sena.In the Bruhanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections held in 2017, the tally of MNS was reduced to seven seats. In October, 2017, six of its corporators defected to Shiv Sena, thus taking its representation down to one seat.""MNS chief Raj Thackeray will make his political line clear on Tuesday,"" said the MNS leader.Ahead of Lok Sabha elections next month, the MNS was trying hard to piggyback the Congress-NCP alliance, but was cold shouldered by the Congress, which opposes the violent ""Marathi manoos"" politics of the Raj Thackeray-led party.The Sharad Pawar-led NCP had also reportedly offered its support to MNS candidate in Kalyan Lok Sabha constituency, but the party decided not to contest the elections."

The BJP has 12 legislators in the 40-member Assembly, whose strength now is 36 after Parrikar's death.The strength of the House has reduced due to demise of BJP MLA Francis D'Souza earlier this year, and Parrikar on Sunday, and resignations of two Congress MLAs Subhash Shirodkar and Dayanand Sopte last year.All the state Congress MLAs met Governor Mridula Sinha on Monday and staked claim to form government in the coastal state.The MLAs, led by Leader of the Opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar, went to Raj Bhawan and handed over a letter to Sinha, saying it was the single largest party in the Assembly and should be allowed to form the government.""We are saddened by the chief minister's demise, but before his final rites are performed, a new government has to be formed...The governor acknowledged that the Congress is the single largest party and she said she will get back to us,"" Kavlekar told reporters.Parrikar was cremated with state honours here Monday, with thousands bidding the affable politician a fond farewell.BJP president Amit Shah, some Union ministers and chief ministers of BJP-ruled states attended the funeral at Miramar.Parrikar's eldest son Utpal lit the funeral pyre.The funeral procession started from the Kala Academy where thousands, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, paid their last respects to the former defence minister.The mortal remains of the 63-year-old senior BJP leader were kept in a flower-decked hearse which left for the Miramar beach, where the last rites were performed."

Motor, along with health, contributes nearly three-fourth of gross premiums written in India.The underlying sub-segments offer multiple opportunities. Higher cost of healthcare and rising incidences of critical illness will likely increase health insurance penetration. Increase in new vehicle sales will be a key growth driver for motor insurance segment.

description,None
content,"NoneNoneThe current market capitalisation (m-cap) of Indian equities is around $2.09 trillion, making it the seventh largest market by size. M-cap, which is the market value of listed firms, typically moves in tandem with economic growth. India is the fastest growing major economy and its gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to touch $5 trillion by 2025, which will reflect in the performance of its stock markets. India’s m-cap has room for improvement as its m-cap-to-GDP ratio, at around 78 percent, is below the world average and also much below its historical peak of 151 percent seen before the global financial crisis in 2008. Brokerage Morgan Stanley says the m-cap of Indian equities is likely to hit $6.7 trillion by 2027.NoneThis makes us ponder: is it time for Indian investors to look at passive funds? Yes, it is -- since it is getting increasingly difficult to out-think the market, investors should aim to at least match the performance of the market (index) as a whole. That can be achieved by following a passive investing strategy, which aims to mimic the index performance as against active managers who try to beat the index return.The advantages of passive investing are well-known. The approach spreads risk widely within a market, avoiding the losses that can follow a dramatic decline in any one specific company or sector. Moreover, it is very simple to implement and is cost effective.Despite very convincing arguments in favour of passive investing, many investors perceive it as a 'dumb' investing strategy. But as George Soros is said to have quipped, ‘If investing is entertaining, if you're having fun, you're probably not making any money. Good investing is boring.""NoneETFs are a far better way of replicating an index as they have lower expenses than index funds. Also, ETFs mimic the performance of the index more closely (this is technically termed as lower tracking error).After selecting a suitable investment vehicle (ETF or index funds), the dilemma often faced by passive investors is selecting the most appropriate index.While Nifty is the most popular index, investors should consider the Nifty Next 50 (Nifty junior) index instead, as it does far better than the Nifty in terms of diversification and performance. Let’s look at a comparative analysis.NoneOver the last 18 years, a total of 41 stocks have been upgraded to Nifty. Out of these 41 stocks (the likes of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance, Titan, Eicher Motors, etc) which were upgraded to the Nifty, 27 stocks still form part of Nifty and weighs about 28 percent of its portfolio as on December 31, 2018.NoneNoneFinancials services have the highest weightage in the Nifty (around 37 percent), while consumer goods is the largest sector in Nifty Next 50 with a weightage of around 28 percent.  It is worth noting that while financial services is the second largest sector in the Nifty Next 50 index, the sector representation is wide including insurance companies. Moreover, an asset management company (HDFC AMC) is slated to enter Nifty Next 50 following the proposed changes that are slated to happen from March 29.At the stock level also, Nifty Next 50 boasts of a well-distributed portfolio, with the top 10 stocks contributing close to 35 percent exposure with individual stock weights ranging between 3 percent and 6 percent.NoneOn the other hand, the Nifty is relatively concentrated, with the top 10 stocks having a combined weightage of around 59 percent, with the weight of a couple of individual stocks at 10 percent.NoneNoneWhile the returns of Nifty Next 50 have been impressive, the volatility or risk (technically known as standard deviation of returns) has been only marginally higher as compared to that of the Nifty, making the return-to-risk ratio for the Nifty Next 50 considerably better than that of the Nifty -- at least for periods longer than three years.NoneNoneOn a fundamental valuation basis, the Nifty Next 50 index looks relatively expensive. But the high price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) multiple of the Nifty Next 50 index is an optical illusion and can be attributed to the highest weight to consumer goods sector. The consumer goods companies which typically trade at high P/E multiple are pushing the overall valuation of Nifty Next 50 upwards.NoneHowever, Nifty Next 50 has significantly underperformed the Nifty in CY18 and therefore the valuations of Nifty Next 50 companies have moderated.NoneWith election outcome taking precedence over earnings and economic fundamentals at the moment, uncertainty is high in the Indian equity markets. This uncertainty makes a low cost, well diversified passive approach tracking the Nifty Next 50 index an appealing investment strategy. ​NoneNone"

It also gets white accents along the edges, which completes its American attire.Apart from the livery though, the bike is mechanically identical to the standard Brutale 800 RR. Built around the same steel trellis frame, it is powered by the 798CC inline three-cylinder engine which makes 142PS of peak power and 87Nm of peak torque. All this power pushes around a dry weight of just 175 kg, making it one of the lightest and fastest naked motorcycles in the market.The bike is held up on Marzocchi USDs in the front, while a fully adjustable Sachs unit supports the single-sided swingarm. The bike stops on two 320mm discs in the front and a single 220mm disc in the rear. It also gets MV Agusta’s signature Rear Lift Mitigation (RLM) that keeps the rear wheel stable under heavy braking.Considering that the standard Brutale 800 RR carries a hefty price tag of Rs 18.99 lakh (ex-showroom), it is safe to assume that the limited-edition variant will see a price rise, possibly hitting the Rs 20-lakh mark. None"

For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the company reported 3.2 percent growth in unaudited consolidated revenue to Rs 996.51 crore from Rs 965.33 crore in the comparable quarter last year.The net profit was up 162.62 percent at Rs 73.15 crore from Rs 27.99 crore in December 2017 quarter. Though the venture is profitable, the company’s net debt as on March 31, 2018, stood at Rs 3,323.8 crore. It has been that way for a quite a long time, earlier reports reveal.NoneNoneNoneAnd it is not just competition from coffee players, CCD is also facing stiff competition from upcoming tea outlets such as Chai Point and Chaayos.NoneRising debt and stiff competition arising out of booming café business could have stalled the enterprise’s expansion plans.That is why L&T's offer of Rs 981 per share for Siddhartha and Coffee Day, which comes to about Rs 3,000-3,200 crore could help the latter cut debt.Market reports suggest this is one of the reasons for Siddhartha to sell his stake in Mindtree and focus on the coffee chain’s expansion.As at the end of December 31, 2018, the company is one of the largest café chains with 1,751 outlets in 250 cities. It had 54,146 vending machines at the end of the third quarter compared to 52,000 in the previous quarter."

description,The MG Motors eZS can travel 428 km on a full charge if driven at an even speed of 60km/hour
content,"UK auto brand MG Motors’ first fully electric vehicle eZS, which is set to debut in the October-December quarter, will be priced below Rs 25 lakh in India, making it the cheapest in the segment.India will be one of the first markets to get the all-electric sports utility vehicle, which was showcased by MG Motors at the Guangzhou Motor Show in November last year.The eZS will be thus become the second model of the company in India, following the launch of MG Hector which too is scheduled in the second half of this year.Apart from MG eZS, three more electric SUVs are expected to be launched in India this year. Of this the Hyundai Kona will be the closest competitor to the eZS as the Korean model has the same dimension and similar power. The eZS is longer and wider than the Kona, which though is expected to be priced above Rs 25 lakh.Compared to its peers, the eZS will likely be the most efficient electric car on Indian roads at that price. As per details shared by MG Motors the eZS can travel 428 kilometers on a full charge if driven at an even speed of 60 km/hour.Kona's mileage is around 400 km.NoneNoneIt takes about 30 minutes of fast charging (direct current) to charge the eZS’s batteries up to 80 percent. A slow charger (alternating current) will take about six hours to fully charge the vehicle.As per European test cycles the vehicle delivered a mileage of 335 kilometers on a full charge. The eZS will be launched in the UK in autumn where it will be priced around 13,500 Pounds.Fully built unitSAIC, China’s largest automaker, which owns MG Motors, will import the eZS as a fully built unit in the initial phase. The company will benefit from India’s change in rules for import of a maximum 2500 cars that does not require homologation.Carmakers do not need to put their models for re-certification in India if they have an international certification that complies with the Indian requirements.NoneDepending on the response for the eZs, MG Motors may switch to assembly of the vehicle to benefit from lower duties. Fully built imported vehicles priced more than $40,000 attract an import duty of 100 percent, whereas assembled cars are charged between 15-30 percent import duties.Hyundai too is considering bringing the Kona through the fully imported route before contemplating an assembly operation."

title,What L&T's bid for Mindtree means for different stakeholders
datetime,2019-03-19 13:24:00+00:00
description,Will the promoters of Mindtree give up and will the other minority shareholders agree to sell at a price of Rs 980?
content,"HighlightsNoneNoneFirst and foremost, let us remember that barring L&T’s deal with V G Siddhartha, nothing else is cast in stone at this point in time. The founder promoters of Mindtree Krishnakumar Natarajan, NS Parthasarathy, Rostow Ravanan and Subroto Bagchi, who hold 3.72%, 1.43%, 0.71% and 3.1% respectively, are opposed to the idea of giving up control. The total holding of promoter and promoter entities is 13.32 percent.NoneSource: Company PPTThe stance of the promoters will remain critical as promoters would like to thwart the deal to the extent possible. The success of L&T would largely hinge on the other prominent shareholders of the company.NoneSource: Ace EquityOf this L&T Mutual Fund wouldn’t be an issue, but the approach of the other shareholders would be key. It is important to mention that Pulak Prasad’s (ex Warburg Pincus) Nalanda holds a significant stake (10.61 percent) and if they are backing L&T, the road will be less rocky for the acquirer.Can minority shareholders ask for more?L&T has proposed to buy a stake in Mindtree at a price of Rs 980 per share valuing the company at 17.8x FY20e earnings.Going by its recent track record of performance, Mindtree is obviously a highly sought-after company, which has carved out a niche for itself in the areas of new technology with its early adoption of digital that is beginning to yield rich dividends now.Hence, to get excited about an exit, it is likely that institutions, as well as minority shareholders, would only be keen to get a significant premium.At a valuation similar to the bellwether TCS (21X Fy20e earnings), the price for Mindtree would have been Rs 1155 per share (the 52-week high price for the stock is Rs 1182).What’s the risk for Mindtree minority shareholders?The biggest risk for Mindtree shareholders is the probable business disruption due to the ongoing ownership battle which might consume disproportionate management bandwidth and could even make clients wary. So the likelihood of a few soft quarters cannot be ruled out.However, if L&T is desperate to own a majority in Mindtree, it might have to pay a higher price than what has been proposed now. In sum, existing shareholders of Mindtree should stay put.L&T – a clear shift in focusThe proposition for L&T is interesting and marks a change worth taking note of. The keenness to acquire a rival IT company (after already having two in its own stable) clearly shows a shift in strategy of this infrastructure company away from its exposure to the investment side of the economy to asset light services business.L&T proposes to do this Mindtree transaction in three stages with a total outgo of close to Rs 10,733 crore at the proposed price of Rs 980 per share.NoneL&T would be using its own balance sheet for funding. In FY18, its standalone networth was Rs 49,000 crore and total borrowings (short term as well as long term) were Rs 10,561 crore and it had over Rs 4000 crore in cash.It is important to remember here that L&T in recent times was mulling a buyback to the tune of Rs 9000 crore. So we do not expect L&T to significantly leverage up for this transaction. Should it succeed, L&T would have access to Mindtree’s incremental profit of close to Rs 590 crore in FY20, and we do not see earnings dilution unless L&T has to pay a much steeper price than what it has proposed now. In the long term, the addition of a high return, low capital intensive business should be value accretive for the shareholders.What does it mean for shareholders of LTI?NoneNoneSource: CompanyIn terms of verticals, LTI has a lot to gain as Mindtree has a strong presence in technology, media & services (close to 39 percent) where the rate of growth of digital adoption is very high. The other verticals where Mindtree has a strong footprint are retail and CPG (consumer packaged goods) and travel and hospitality – industries that are in the forefront of digital adoption. In fact, the share of digital in total business for Mindtree is much higher at 49.5 percent compared to 37 percent for LTI. There is very little client overlap between the two companies.For LTI shareholders, should Mindtree eventually comes under its fold, there would be synergistic gains. LTI has been reporting a much better operating margin of close to 20 percent compared to 15 percent for Mindtree. While for LTI this has come with a record high utilisation rate of 82 percent (compared to 74.6 percent for Mindtree), we feel the synergistic benefits coupled with sharper focus of LTI management can lead to improvement in Mindtree’s margin performance.Since the LTI balance sheet is not being used for this acquisition, this is good news for LTI shareholders. After a period of underperformance (mainly due to concerns of the acquisition), the stock is valued at 16X FY20e earnings. With a key event risk behind us, we recommend accumulation.L&T has a 74.8 percent stake in LTI and 80.4 stake in L&T Technology Services (engineering focused IT). Should it succeed in getting a majority stake in Mindtree, the combined revenue of the three entities for the first nine months of FY19 would have been $2.2 bn."

However, Sanjay Singh told the newspaper that “this is the time to save the country, not just talks of a party”.This is not the first time that the 78-year-old has offered to mediate talks between the Congress and the AAP, which have been adversaries in Delhi since the inception of the latter.On February 14, 2019, Pawar had hosted a dinner for leaders of all major political parties, which had brought Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal on the same table. At that time too, an alliance between the two parties in Delhi was suggested.However, recalling that the Congress’ Delhi unit were against any tie-up with the AAP, Gandhi had signalled his reluctance. When it was founded, the AAP was a massive anti-corruption movement against the incumbent Congress in Delhi, and had targeted the then chief minister Sheila Dikshit for her involvement in numerous scams – the reason why Dikshit has vocally expressed her disappointment over an alliance with AAP.Dikshit followed it up with a letter to Rahul Gandhi, also signed by the city unit’s three working presidents, that an alliance with AAP will hurt the Grand Old Party’s prospects in the long run."

description,The global investment bank expects returns to be driven largely by earnings with potential valuation overshoot in the near-term.
content,"NoneThe global investment bank had downgraded India to market weight in mid-September last year on near-term macro headwinds, stretched valuations as well as election uncertainties.Now, better than expected December quarter earnings with signs of an uptick in demand and improving asset quality, and the return of foreign institutional flows are some of the factors which led to the upgrade.“On a full calendar-year basis, we expect earnings growth in India to pick up to 16 percent this year and 14 percent next year. We expect Nifty to reach our refreshed target of 12,500 in 12 months compared to 11,700 earlier,” said the Goldman Sachs note.The global investment bank expects returns to be driven largely by earnings with potential valuation overshoot in the near term.Goldman Sachs is of the view that ‘Value’ and ‘Cyclical’ parts of the markets will perform better in coming months with investors rotating out of ‘safe haven’ or ‘quality’ stocks as political uncertainty continues to fade.The global investment bank lists out seven stocks which trade at 16x forward PE and offers 16 percent earnings growth on a median basis. “On an equal-weighted basis, our ‘Value cyclicals’ list of stocks outperformed Nifty by 15 percent in the three months heading into 2014 elections,” it said.NoneNoneOversold midcaps are also another category of stocks which could do well in the near future, suggests the Goldman Sach note. While mid and small-cap stocks have recovered with the Nifty Mid-cap 100 index rallying by about 11 percent over the past month, the recovery follows a sharp underperformance over the past 1-year.The relative performance of the Nifty Midcap-100 is still more than 20 percent below its 2018-highs suggesting further room for upside.However, earnings sentiment remains weak with mid and small-cap stocks continuing to see sharp earnings cuts. “We thus remain selective in mid-caps and prefer stocks that have been oversold but are seeing positive earnings momentum and have relatively stronger balance sheets,” said the Goldman note.The global investment bank filter stocks which have either a Buy or a Neutral-rating within Nifty Mid Cap 100 that are at least 10 percent below their 1-year high, have seen either EPS upgrades or slowing downgrades over the past month and have relatively stronger balance sheets.NoneNone"

description,The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was passed to inquire into allegations of corruption against public functionaries. The act requires setting up of an ombudsman – Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in the states.
content,"Five years after the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act received the President’s nod, a high-level committee comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi cleared former Supreme Court judge Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose to head India’s first Lokpal – the national anti-corruption ombudsman.As per the Act, the Lokpal is to be headed by a chairperson “who is or has been a Chief Justice of India or is or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or an eminent person… of impeccable integrity and outstanding ability having special knowledge and expertise of not less than 25 years in matters relating to anti-corruption policy, public administration, vigilance, finance including insurance and banking, law and management”.Justice PC Ghose, known for upholding the conviction and sentencing of VK Sasikala in the disproportionate assets case, seems to be the right man for the job.Born into a lawyer’s family on May 28, 1952, Pinaki is the son of Justice Shambhu Chandra Ghose, who was a former chief justice of the Calcutta High Court.He graduated in commerce from St Xavier’s College in Calcutta and later obtained a degree in Law and Attorney at Law from Calcutta University. In 1976, he enrolled himself with the Bar Council of West Bengal, specializing in civil and company affairs.In 1997, he became a judge of the Calcutta High Court, and in March 2013, he was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court. He retired from the apex court in May 2017 and has been a member of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) since then.Justice PC Ghose was a part of the Division Bench, along with Justice Amitava Roy, which convicted VS Sasikala, a close aide of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, in the disproportionate assets case. Even though Jayalalithaa was an accused in the same case, charges against her were dropped because she died during the pendency of the case.Justice Ghose was also a part of the two-judge bench that had banned the centuries-old tradition of jallikattu (bullfighting) in Tamil Nadu.Another important case handled by Justice Ghose in his stint as a judge of the Supreme Court was directing a trial court in 2017 to proceed against political leaders LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti and others for alleged criminal conspiracy in the Babri Masjid demolition case.Reminiscing his days of working with Justice Ghose, Supreme Court advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said he was very friendly towards all lawyers and had an “extremely cool temperament”.None"

description,"Even before Nair's demise, the company had already sold off its luxurious Kovalam property and an IT Park in Chennai. But the high level of debt forced the company to keep exploring sale of properties."
content,"It was a succession plan that did not pan out as envisioned.NoneOn March 20, the board of Hotel Leelaventure, which owns the Leela brand and runs properties under it, decided to sell all but one of its assets, under a slump sale arrangement to Canada's real estate fund Brookfield Asset Management.Brookfield owns and manages 155 hotels in US, UK and Australia.Leela's operational hotels in Delhi, Udaipur, Chennai and Bengaluru (having a total of 1,017 rooms), a land parcel in Agra (near the Taj Mahal), leasehold rights for land in Bengaluru and license agreement for Mumbai property form the core of the deal.Though Leela said it intends to use the Rs 3,950 crore for repaying its Rs 4,000 crore debt, this multi-layer transaction has benefitted Brookfield more than Leela.For instance, the sell-off of the 206-room Goa property in 2015, fetched Leela Rs 721 crore, translating to Rs 3.5 crore per room.The present deal has similar terms, despite entailing much more.Brookfield managed to get the four properties (all located at prime locations) for a valuation that is not very different from the Goa hotel transaction, a good deal considering the Canadian company also got brand Leela and other assets. It is evident that there has not been any healthy appreciation in the value of its properties during the last four years.A lifelineIn February, JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company (JMFARC) filed an application with the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai bench, against Hotel Leela. The application was under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016. This was done to get the best valuation even as the powers of the promoters of Hotel Leela becomes limited in the tribunal.JMFARC, which made brothers Vivek and Dinesh Nair forgo salaries for two consecutive years, controls 96 percent of the Hotel Leela’s debt. The company had been in talks with a variety of interested parties including private equity investors, asset management companies, state-backed investment funds and other prospective bidders. However on most occasions, the talks fell through over asset valuation.Hotel Leela started defaulting on quarterly interest payments on debentures to Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India in 2018. By end the end of last financial year, Leela's debt climbed Rs 3,800 crore.How did Leela get into this mess? Leela Hotels closed FY14 with a debt of nearly Rs 5,000 crore.  After Capt. Nair's demise in 2014, the company was struggling to push itself to profitability, mainly due to the ballooning cost of finance that eroded its margins repeatedly.Unlike its competitors such as Hyatt, Marriott and Intercontinental, who run readymade properties on management contracts, the management at Leela decided to infuse own funds to build new properties. As most of this was done through debt, the interest payout on the loans made it difficult to avoid losses.NoneEven before Nair's demise, the company had already sold off its luxurious Kovalam property and an IT Park in Chennai. But the high level of debt forced the company to keep exploring sale of properties. Soon after the Goa property was sold, it was followed by monetisation of another IT park in Kochi.If the current deal goes through Hotel Leela will switch to becoming a management company from an ownership company. It will continue to run all its current properties which will be under three different ownerships."

title,Can NRIs purchase life insurance in India?
datetime,2019-03-19 17:22:00+00:00
description,Foreign Exchange Management Act allows NRIs to buy any insurance plan that meets their requirements.
content,"Mahavir ChopraYou may be well settled in a foreign country but your love and concern for your family members’ future just keeps growing over the years. Well, life insurance is here to put your mind at ease. Let’s see how!If you are an NRI and are looking for an affordable protection plan from India, there are now some interesting plans offered by insurers. You can buy term insurance plans at premiums that are one of the cheapest in the world, at the same time it gives you the comfort of buying through a known brand back in your homeland.While this could be interesting, you may have a lot of questions sitting in a foreign country about the process of enrolling into such plans. We have tried to answer them below.Can NRIs buy a life insurance plan?Yes; Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), People of Indian Origin (PIOs) can buy a life insurance plan in India. Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) allows NRIs to buy any plan that meets their requirements of protecting themselves and their family whether he is currently residing in India or not.No; being present in India is not at all compulsory while buying a life insurance plan. It may differ from company to company. The best way to go about buying a life insurance for an NRI is by going the online route. This way you can compare all available options to find the best plan and buy it instantly from the comfort of your home or office from your current country of residence. Though not required but being present in India while buying a life insurance plan is highly beneficial. If you are present in India at the time of buying the policy, the insurer can conduct the required medical check-ups. The cost of these medical check-ups is borne by the insurer. If you buy a life insurance policy from the country of your current residence, you may be asked to undergo a medical check-up there and then send across the reports to the insurer in India. Thus, you would be incurring an additional cost from your own pocket. Insurers have started offering a high sum assured on their pure term plans like Max Life offers a cover of up to Rs. 2.5 crores and HDFC Life offers Rs. 3 crore without any medicals. Insurers are also offering telephonic underwriting services to help NRIs buy Life Insurance Plans.In the meantime, some insurers have started setting up offices in major foreign countries which help in documentation, medical tests and other formalities involved in buying a life insurance plan, global presence will definitely take time.Will my country of residence affect my application?Yes, life insurance companies pay close attention to the information regarding the country you are currently residing in. A country that is more prone to civil or military issues, has an unstable government and constant violent attacks take place on its citizens, such countries are labelled as High-risk Countries. In the same way, a country that is peaceful, has a stable government, proper law and order situation, such countries are labelled as Low-risk Countries. Hence, if your country of residence is a High-risk country, your application for life insurance will be rejected or a higher premium may be charged and if it’s a low-risk country it will be easily accepted.The premium for your life insurance policy can be paid by remittance in foreign currency or through an NRO bank account or NRE/FCNR bank account. Here it is important to check the currency in which the policy is issued to you. If the life insurance policy is issued to you in a foreign currency, the premiums will have to be paid in the denominated foreign currency from an NRE/FCNR account. If the policy is issued in Indian Rupees, the premiums will be paid through an NRO account.Just as premiums, benefits paid from the life insurance companies will also be in the currency denoted in the policy document i.e. either in rupee or foreign currency. For making a claim on your life insurance policy, you/nominee would require to submit the documents as listed in the policy document. This list of documents required will vary from insurer to insurer.Most commonly in case of a death benefit, the insurer will require the original policy document, identity proof of the nominee, death certificate of the insured person and so on. An important point to remember here is that if death occurs in a foreign country the insurer will ask for a death certificate which is attested by the Indian embassy or High Commission in that country. If an NRI dies in India, an attestation is not required in such cases.Life Insurance is the best way one can manage the risk of protecting their family members in their absence. Even though you are an NRI or a PIO, you must buy a life insurance plan at the earliest possible to secure your loved ones financially. Loss of the breadwinner can be a major setback for the remaining of the family members and life insurance can help in securing a decent lifestyle."

title,Asus ROG Zephyrus GX701 Review: Top-notch portable gaming laptop with hefty price tag
datetime,2019-04-11 16:09:00+00:00
description,The GX701 perfectly caters to the requirements of content creators by day and gaming enthusiast by night. 
content,"The Asus ROG Zephyrus GX701 is easily one of the most powerful gaming laptops. Asus’ ability to pack a large screen and an RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU in such a slim chassis is impressive. The GX701 perfectly caters to the requirements of ‘content creators by day and enthusiast gamers by night’. However, packing over-the-top performance in a slim profile comes at a price; literally.PerformanceThe GX701 we tested was outfitted with the RTX 2080 Max-Q, the most powerful mobile GPU till date. In our Geekbench test, the Intel Core i7-87550H received a single-core score of 4742 and a multi-core score of 17,659. Here’s what our gaming tests yielded.NoneWith high-performance comes high temperatures and performance on mobile RTX cards are highly dependent on the laptop manufacturers’ ability to optimise cooling and power delivery. It's worth noting that according to Asus, disabling the RGB logo on top of the keyboard could see a 3 percent decrease in temperatures when dealing with demanding games and applications over extended periods.NoneAsus hasn’t revamped the cooling system on the new Zephyrus RTX gaming laptops, so except temperature above the keyboard to really heat up and the fans to get quite loud. But we’ve noticed that none of the above-mentioned issues really hamper your gaming experience.Our noise cancelling headset pretty much blocked out any noise caused by the fans and when gaming at full volume on the laptop’s speakers, the noise from the fans was almost unnoticeable. While the portion above the keyboard tends to get quite hot at times, the rest of the laptop remains relatively cool. The excess heat doesn’t really trickle down into the keyboard area and doesn’t cause an inconvenience while gaming.NoneAs the ROG GX701 is the only RTX laptop, we’ve tested so far, and while we may see similar performance numbers on models with these specifications, topping the GX701 in terms of performance would require massive powerhouses like the Alienware Area-51m or the ROG Mothership. The GX701 crushes last generation laptops with much higher FPS numbers.DisplayThere’s more good news for gamers as the FPS isn’t the only thing turned-up on the GX701. The new Zephyrus also gets a 17.3-inch IPS panel with a 144 Hz refresh rate,3 ms response time and support for Nvidia G-sync technology. However, the standout feature of this display is its factory calibration from Pantone with 100% sRGB colour gamut.NoneWhat this essentially means is that the display on the GX701 is an excellent option for video editors and photographers. The screen not only looks fantastic out of the box but makes the laptop an excellent choice for content creators, where colour accuracy is of the utmost importance.DesignAsus ROG GX701  gets full marks for design. Despite a 17.3-inch display, the latest hardware and an excellent cooling system, the Zephyrus S GX701 still manages to look absolutely gorgeous with its slim profile (Thickness – 0.62 inches). RGB lighting encompasses the entire laptop from the keyboard to logo on the front.NoneThe GX701 follows the traditional Zephyrus design by shifting the keyboard to the bottom of the laptop and trackpad at the side. This move makes using the device on anything other than a desk nearly impossible. But this really doesn’t make much of a difference as gaming would require the use of a desk or table. Additionally, the Zephyrus also houses a nifty volume roller on the top left, while function keys feature multimedia shortcuts that allow you to control playback, switch between power modes, adjust brightness and more.What else is in the box?The lack of a webcam gives the new Zephyrus very slim bezels. Asus does provide a detachable webcam which can easily be clipped on to the laptop. The company’s rationale is that gamers don’t use webcams. Webcams on gaming laptops are almost impossible to stream on, but the webcam that arrives with the GX701 offers FHD video recording at 60 fps.None BatteryOne area where the Zephyrus could certainly use some work is in the battery department. We understand that gaming laptops rarely see more than a couple of hours of battery life when unplugged. But the Zephyrus GX701 is a 3.5-lakh rupees gaming laptop, and Asus should have done a little more in terms of battery life.NoneOnce you unplug the GX701, it switches to ‘on battery’ mode. This significantly lowers the performance of the laptop by switching to integrated graphics (This can be turned off, and you can switch back to the RTX 2080 Max-Q). While this won’t make much of a difference when performing standard Windows 10 tasks, it will significantly hamper performance in games. Although the Asus has tried a few things to prolong the battery life, they simply aren’t enough. We saw close to 90 minutes of Apex Legends gameplay without using external power and about four and a half hours of Netflix with the volume turned to full.Final VerdictAsus’ emphasis on colour accuracy coupled with an impressive spec sheet and slim profile, make the ROG Zephyrus S GX701 an excellent mobile workstation by day and gaming powerhouse by night. If you are an enthusiast gamer who's looking for a slim alternative to a chunky gaming laptop without any compromise in performance, then the Zephyrus S GX701 is perfect. But its hefty price tag puts it out of reach of average consumers.NoneAlso, check out our first impressions of the less costly ROG Zephyrus S GX531GW."

Taking the role of KTM’s flagship motorcycle, the Duke 790 will be the most powerful offering of the company in India.NoneComing to the country via Completely Knocked Down (CKD) route, it will be assembled at KTM’s Chakan factory. While the bike is yet to hit the streets, KTM has already begun accepting bookings at select dealerships across India. Considering it is a CKD motorcycle with many localised parts, it is expected that its price tag will be lower than others in its segment.The Duke 790 is powered by a 799CC parallel twin engine, which has a firing angle of 315 degrees. This helps the bike get a stronger low end as well as constant mid-range torque. It makes 103.5BHP of maximum power and 86Nm of peak torque. This makes the Duke 790 one of the torquiest bikes in its segment. This engine is mated to a six-speed gearbox, with a slipper clutch.NoneIt is built around KTM’s trusted Trellis frame, with 43mm USD from WP doing duty in the front and a monoshock at the rear. Lights on both ends are LED, as well as the DRLs. The bike also has a TFT colour instrument console which supports smartphone connectivity via Bluetooth.  The bike also has a high mounted exhaust to complete its streetfighter look.NoneThe bike stops with two-disc brakes in the front and one at the back, while ABS will be offered as standard. It also gets traction control and riding modes, which vary the output power according to road conditions.The bike is expected to carry a price tag of Rs 7 lakh (ex-showroom). However, considering its localisation, KTM could place the price tag even lower. The Duke 790 will be launched in India in the coming months."

Net working capital cycle has improved to 60 days, which is a marked improvement from 72 days in FY18. Inventory of skimmed milk products (SMP) has moderated, leading to lower working capital investment.

However, due to higher milk procurement prices, EBITDA margin expansion would be gradual in the near term. Here we expect it to stabilise around 10.5 percent in the near term, though the management is hopeful of clocking 11-12 percent EBITDA margin in FY20.As far as the stock is concerned, it has corrected by 38 percent from its 52 week high and currently trades (16 times FY20 estimated earnings) at a significant discount to the consumer staple universe (around 42 times). As we currently expect earnings CAGR of over 20 percent in the next two years, Parag Milk Foods offers an interesting opportunity (PEG of less than one) on the dairy consumption theme.Follow @anubhavsaysNone"

title,Cloudtail looks to onboard Amazon's smaller sellers with better offers
datetime,2019-03-20 15:51:00+00:00
description,The idea is to offer the small sellers a fixed amount for specific set of products and then push the same products on Amazon under the banner of Cloudtail.
content,"Moneycontrol News Cloudtail, the largest seller of Amazon India is learnt to be luring multiple smaller sellers of Amazon to sell their products to it instead of selling it directly on the website of Amazon. The idea is to offer the small sellers a fixed amount for specific set of products and then push the same products on Amazon under the banner of Cloudtail.Interestingly, the development happens even as the government is trying to reduce over-dependence of marketplaces on their preferred vendors. To ensure that, the government in December also announced the foreign direct investment (FDI) guidelines which essentially bars a single vendor from selling more than 25 percent of the total products sold on the marketplace. It also stops marketplaces from owning stakes in any of the sellers that sell on their platform.India doesn't allow FDI in inventory based e-commerce business and only promotes a marketplace model wherein multiple sellers sell their products through these e-commerce platforms.While in principle every seller is well within its rights to source products from manufacturers, dealers or even other sellers, this move doesn't quite go well with the spirit and the intent of the recently announced Press Note 2 or the revised FDI guidelines which wants to promote smaller sellers sell online, claim sellers.""The focus of Amazon has shifted from marketplace to running a retail operation through Cloudtail. Sellers have now very few options to sell goods and therefore are aligning with the likes of Cloudtail for short term profits. From our experience, in order to lure sellers, Cloudtail is paying upto 30% higher prices and also selling goods at lower cost. However, in the long run this will get reversed,"" a spokesperson of All India Online Vendors Association told Moneycontrol.""Small sellers do it for short term gain since they know Cloudtail will be able to sell their goods fast because Amazon gives preferential treatment to Cloudtail,"" the spokesperson added.Cloudtail is a joint venture between NR Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures and Amazon Asia. According to media reports, Catamaran Ventures recently also increased its stake in Cloudtail's parent company Prione Business Services to 76 percent from 51 percent earlier in order to comply with the revised norms.Amazon declined to comment saying that Cloudtail takes its own decisions and Amazon cannot comment on its behalf. Prione, the parent firm of Cloudtail on the other hand, did not respond to media query.According to sellers on a Facebook page by the name of Amazon India sellers, there are multiple ways to partner with Cloudtail. Sellers can keep the products in their own warehouse but can still have the product sold under the name of Cloudtail. Earlier Cloudtail just used to buy the products from the sellers but now they are also open to authorising the warehouse of the seller from where he can directly ship the product under the name of Cloudtail. Once Cloudtail comes on board, sales as well as returns is the responsibility of Cloudtail. Sellers mostly get paid out on net sales.Sellers also claim that Amazon charges very little commission from Cloudtail as compared to the commission charged from any other seller on the platform. The commissions for a regular vendors may range between 16-26 percent or more depending on different categories. This is a huge amount as compared to 5-8 percent that Amazon is learnt to be charging Cloudtail. Many sellers also say that it is difficult to compete with a giant like Cloudtail. So if an offer comes they accept it as a goodwill gesture.""In simple terms, if Cloudtail is interested in your product category and you reject it, then it will approach some other seller. So better to go with Cloudtail,"" posted a seller on the same social media page."

title,What Supreme Court's judgement on applicability of PF contributions means
datetime,2019-03-20 10:21:00+00:00
description,"The Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (the PF Act) defines ‘basic wages’ as all emoluments paid in cash to an employee in accordance with the terms of their contract of employment, subject to certain exceptions."
content,"Parizad SirwallaThe Supreme Court (SC) on February 28, 2019, delivered a judgement (disposing off multiple appeals) on whether the special allowances paid by an establishment to their employees would form part of basic wages and consequently attract Provident Fund (PF) contributions.Although there have been past rulings by the SC on this subject, this judgement is extremely relevant as it elaborates on certain important principles for determining the salary on which PF is to be contributed by establishments and their employees.The Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (the PF Act) defines ‘basic wages’ as all emoluments paid in cash to an employee in accordance with the terms of their contract of employment, subject to certain exceptions.The employer, under the PF Act, has a statutory obligation to deduct the specified percentage (currently 12 percent) of the contribution from the employee’s salary and make a matching contribution.In spite of various judgements (of SC and various High Courts) in the past, there was still a certain amount of ambiguity prevailing among establishments on whether certain components are to be included in the definition of basic wages.Over a period of time, many establishments/employers had introduced various elements of allowances/reimbursements/components in the compensation structure of the employees. Hence, there was extensive litigation on whether these components should be included under ‘basic wages’ for the purposes of PF contributions.In this judgement, the SC has once again relied on the principles of ‘universality’ and ‘contingency’ as laid down in the earlier judgements and pronounced the following principles to test the applicability of PF to different allowances (by whatever name called):NoneNoneNoneNoneThe SC ,in the instant cases, noted that no material had been placed by the establishments to demonstrate that the allowances in question (i.e. travel allowance, conveyance canteen allowance, management allowance, special allowance, education allowance, medical allowance, etc.) were either variable or the allowances in question were not paid across the board to all employees in a particular category.Hence, the test of universality (i.e. allowances paid to all employees/all employees in a particular category, etc.) and whether the allowance paid in question is linked to specific/additional performance, become the guiding principles for all establishments.The principles elaborated by the SC would need to be applied by the establishments in determining the salary on which PF is being contributed.Also, the SC was not required to specifically comment on the aspect that if the salary for PF contribution already exceeded statutory wage obligation of Rs 15,000 per month, whether the employers will be required to contribute on the higher amount.In this context, in another SC ruling in the case of Marathwada Gramin Bank [AIR 3567 SC (2011)], it was held that employers cannot be compelled to contribute beyond the statutory liability.This new judgement by the SC would also be relevant for establishments employing foreign nationals qualifying to be International Workers (i.e. other than Indian passport holders) where the statutory wage ceiling of Rs 15,000 per month does not apply.While there are still certain areas (e.g. retrospective applicability of the SC judgement, impact on other retiral payment, etc.) which warrant further deliberation, establishments may start re-evaluating their employee compensation policies and documentation in this regard to ensure compliances with the regulations under the PF Act.This is especially relevant in the context that the PF department has already issued a circular directing its field officers to utilise this ruling in defending other similar cases and taking necessary action in view of this judgement."

content,"Kolkata-based SREI Equipment Finance Limited has come under the scanner of various agencies after a whistleblower's letter alleged that the financing firm had restructured loans to prevent them from becoming non-performing assets (NPAs).The letter, dated December 19, 2018, was sent to Additional Commissioner, CGST, with copies to Reserve Bank of India and Serious Fraud Investigation Office.""Company regularly restructured bad loans to escape NPA/launder money through the hawala route. RBI guidelines are systematically bypassed…"" said the letter.NoneNoneA senior officer in GST department added that the agency is examining loans that SREI had given to infrastructure and real estate companies. “The loans were given on the basis of sale deeds between inter-company transfers. As of now, we have not received any invoice generation receipt”.NoneThe company added that it is making complaints to authorities ""for criminal conspiracy and attempted extortion"".Adding that the company has a ""well laid out framework"" in accordance with RBI guidelines for sanctioning and disbursing loans, SREI said: ""We emphatically refute all the allegations… proposals are thereafter approved/rejected by empowered committees and not by any individual; the company is regularly audited by several regulatory agencies and reputed auditors.""Nirmal Lifestyle loanNoneAccording to the sales deed papers, Nirmal Lifestyle got a loan of Rs 22.5 crore from SREI Equipment to buy construction equipment from its unit on March 16, 2018.  But within 12 days of getting the loan, Nirmal Lifestyle repaid loans worth Rs 22.5 crore, which many of its units, including Nirmal Lifestyle Kalyan, owed SREI Equipment. This despite the authorization letter mentioning that the money sanctioned can’t be used in re-payment of loan.Both, SREI and Nirmal Lifestyle Limited, have refuted the charges.“We have taken this loan from SREI against various assets/properties/Land owned by Nirmal Group and the said loan of Rs. 22.5 Cr has been availed by Nirmal Lifestyle against the assets owned by Nirmal Lifestyle only,” said Nirmal Lifestyle, in response to Moneycontrol’s query.“The value of the securities provided under the loan agreements are more than the required assets cover. We have various existing loans with Srei and repayment is done regularly as a part of our contractual obligation,” it added.SREI Equipment claimed that it had extended the loan to Nirmal Lifestyle against its existing assets.""We would like to deny that Rs 22.50 cr was financed by us to Nirmal Lifestyle to buy construction equipment from its subsidiary Nirmal Lifestyle Kalyan. We have all the necessary documents corroborating these facts. Further the security charge created in our favour can be verified in CERSAI and with ROC.""It added:""Therefore, your assumption that we have financed to Nirmal Lifestyle for buying of Construction equipment from its subsidiary Nirmal Lifestyle Kalyan is factually incorrect.“We would also like to emphasise that providing financing solution to our customers with judicious security cover of various security mix and also timely collection of dues thereafter, is our normal course of business and in Nirmal Group of Companies too, there is nothing out of the normal which is worth highlighting”."

On the inside, Land Rover has maintained the simple and minimalistic design of the cabin but has a lot of luxurious alternatives for letting the customer personalise his car. It also gets an optional twin touchscreen InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system which has new and faster software. It also gets 16-way seat controls and cabin air ionisation.One more noticeable update is the 48-volt mild-hybrid powertrain which will be available at launch, along with its standard four-cylinder engine. This powertrain is intended to harvest energy which is usually lost during deceleration and store it in an under-floor battery.The car also receives an upgraded version of Range Rover’s command driving position, dubbed ‘ClearSight Rear View Mirror’ which transforms it into an HD video screen when active. It also gets ‘ClearSight Ground View’ technology which helps the driver see through the hood and under the front end of the vehicle via a 180-degree projection of the ground on the vehicle’s upper touchscreen.These upgrades will translate to a higher price tag, but it remains to be seen when Land Rover will launch the new Evoque in India."

The quality of our roasting plant and processing equipment is matched by the excellence of our brewmasters who are the best in the country.”Mindtree journeyIn 1999, IT veteran Ashok Soota roped in Siddhartha when the 10 founders including Subroto Bagchi, Rostow Ravanan and KK Natarajan were putting together Mindtree.According to a CNBC-TV18 report, Siddhartha has invested Rs 340 crore for stakes in Mindtree since 1999, and by selling his 20.4 percent stake to L&T, he has taken home a massive profit of nearly Rs 3,000 crore after 20 years.Siddhartha’s background as an investment banker probably came in handy when he pitched in time and again when Mindtree needed it.Siddhartha invested close to Rs 44 crore to buy a 6.6 percent stake in Mindtree that was just starting up in 1999. In 2011, he picked up another 5.57 percent and 2.05 percent stakes for Rs 85 crore and Rs 40 crore, respectively. Later in 2012, he invested Rs 171 crore to buy an additional 6.84 percent stake in Mindtree. This translates roughly into an internal rate of return of 20.43 percent per annum.Apart from the coffee business, the Coffee Day group acquired SICAL Logistics, Tanglin Developments (which has Global Village tech park) and Coffee Day Hotels & Resorts."

title,Ruling BJD in Odisha faces real challenge in 2 decades
datetime,2019-03-20 12:38:00+00:00
description,"The Naveen Patnaik-led regional party won four consecutive assembly elections since 2000 with its seat tally rising every time, but the poll scenario in the state is different this time."
content,"For the first time in around two decades, the ruling Biju Janata Dal in Odisha is finding the coming assembly and Lok Sabha polls an uphill task in the face of tough challenges from the BJP and the Congress, besides the discontentment within.The Naveen Patnaik-led regional party won four consecutive assembly elections since 2000 with its seat tally rising every time, but the poll scenario in the state is different this time.In 2014, the BJD had bagged 117 out of the 147 assembly seats in Odisha, followed by the Congress (16) and the BJP (10).In parliamentary polls too, which were held simultaneously, the BJD dominated the poll turf winning 20 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, while the BJP managed just one.In 2009, when the BJD went to polls alone after snapping ties with its decade-old ally BJP, the regional party tasted victory in 103 assembly constituencies, while Congress candidates won 27 seats and BJP had to be content with six.The poll scenario was different in 2000 and 2004 when the regional party fought the elections in alliance with the BJP, but still the BJD enjoyed supremacy.While the BJD won 68 and 61 assembly seats in 2000 and 2004 respectively, BJP nominees were victorious in 38 and 32 constituencies on these occasions.However, the four-phase simultaneous polling next month is going to be an acid test for Patnaik as both the BJP and the Congress appeared to have gained strength in the state.Coupled with the opposition surge, disgruntled leaders leaving the BJD has come as a major setback to the ruling party, which once looked invincible. Anti-incumbency factor has also added to its woes.Senior BJP leaders claim, the ruling BJD will be ""wiped out"" after 2019 polls and that the government will ""collapse"" under the weight of anti-incumbency.BJP Odisha in-charge Arun Singh has claimed that the countdown of the Patnaik government has started.BJP's optimism notwithstanding, BJD president and Chief Minister Patnaik, who is seeking re-election for the fifth term, claims his party will perform ""very well"" in both Lok Sabha and assembly polls.Despite Patnaik's confidence, a host of BJD leaders have quit the party due to varied reasons, including fear of denial of ticket or differences with the leadership.Sitting Nabarangpur MP Balabhadra Majhi and Nilagiri MLA Sukant Nayak resigned from the BJD recently, alleging they were ignored and neglected.Majhi, who later joined the BJP, claimed he was ""cheated"" after being made to quit a job in the railways and lured into poll fray in 2014, while Nayak alleged he was ""mentally tortured and harassed"" and kept outside discussions on major issues pertaining to his area.Trinath Gomango, BJD MLA and brother-in-law of former Congress chief minister Giridhar Gomango, too has joined BJP.Voices of discontent among BJD leaders are also being heard in Jharsuguda and Sundargarh following induction of Congress legislators Naba Kishore Das and Jogesh Singh who represented these assembly seats respectively. Old-timers who were denied party tickets openly aired their anger.While senior leader from Sundargarh, Kusum Thete, resigned from the BJD, accusing the party leadership of cheating her, former assembly speaker and ruling party leader from Jharsuguda, Kishore Mohanty, has been sulking for sometime.BJP stalwarts, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah, have undertaken whirlwind tours of the state to boost their party's poll prospects.The saffron party is also trying to attract known loyalists of the legendary Biju Patnaik, father of the current chief minister.The recent induction of former MP Baijayant Panda and ex-minister Damodar Rout into the BJP is considered a part of this strategy. Both the leaders are from the coastal belt, home to around 68 assembly seats where the BJP is not so strong.BJP state in-charge Arun Singh claimed several BJD leaders are keen to join his party.Challenge from the Congress is also no less formidable with party chief Rahul Gandhi undertaking back-to- back visits to the state.Optimistic after its victories in assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the Congress is making efforts to galvanise its base in the state where it is out of power for 19 years.BJD leaders such as state Finance Minister S B Behera and Rajya Sabha MP Prasanna Acharya, however, said party hopping is nothing unusual during elections.People leaving the BJD and joining other parties will have no impact on poll prospects of the ruling party, they said adding the ""good work"" done by the government will have support among people.The chief minister on Monday announced his decision to contest from two assembly seats — his home turf Hinjili in the southern Ganjam district and Bijepur in the western part of the state.Western Odisha is considered important for the BJD as the region has five Lok Sabha and 35 assembly seats. Of the five Lok Sabha seats, BJD had won four in 2014 polls.However, the situation appeared to have changed since then with the BJP consolidating its base there. In 2017 panchayat polls, the saffron party put up an impressive show in western Odisha by bagging 126 of the 209 Zilla Parishad seats, while the BJD had won only 56 seats and the Congress 22."

He doesn't think: 'Ah, that was okay, I'll peak at some point'. Just do it every day. That's the sort of mindset I've been wanting to hit.""What Buttler loves about India is the ""chaos"", which makes every cricketer stronger.""You have to deal with that chaos,"" he said. ""It might be the timings of things. It might be training's not perfect. We're very lucky in England: everything's very structured.

title,Comment | Lok Sabha polls: Mahagathbandhan is a paper tiger
datetime,2019-03-20 13:28:00+00:00
description,The idea of a united fight was at best utopian and at worst a cynical attempt to woo the voter.
content,"Rajesh KumarThe upcoming Lok Sabha polls, the Opposition never tires of telling us, is no ordinary election. According to them, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance's policies are undermining the secular consensus of the past seventy years. It is, so the opposition says, a momentous battle against the pernicious ideology of the Sangh Parivar, a fight to save the soul of the nation. That was why unity was so important, claimed Opposition leaders.But curiously, nothing of that sort seems to be happening. The idea of a united fight was at best utopian and at worst a cynical attempt to woo the voter. In fact, even as the last date of filing nominations for the first phase of election is just a few days away, the Congress party is still in the process of finalising alliances in states such as Bihar and Jharkhand. The talks with the Left are said to have hit a roadblock in West Bengal. The party has been left out of a formidable alliance of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh (UP). In Andhra Pradesh, the Chandrababu Naidu led Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has parted ways with the Congress.The making and breaking of alliances highlight at least three important things about the state of the Opposition.First, the idea of a grand alliance or Mahagathbandhan is simply not feasible. If opposition parties are not able to come together in the present political environment, if they are unable to close ranks now at what they say is a crucial time, it is difficult to argue that it can happen in the future against a party like the BJP. One of the reasons for this could be that, while most of the Opposition want to see the Narendra Modi-led NDA defeated, they are not able to find sufficient common ground to work together. The fact that there is no strong leader who could bring most opposition parties on a common platform is also affecting the possibilities for the Mahagathbandhan.Second, Opposition parties are more worried about their own short-term interest. For instance, the SP-BSP alliance in UP did not include the Congress party. It is likely that the alliance would have benefited if Congress was a part of it. However, the Congress party would have gained more and affected the post-poll possibilities for the SP and the BSP. In Andhra Pradesh, the TDP decided to go alone after the alliance with the Congress did not work in Telangana.This is in sharp contrast to what the BJP did in Bihar, for instance. The party decided to leave seats that it had won in 2014 for its alliance partners. Though this is bound to affect the morale of local workers, the party has made a calculated move, despite being in a stronger bargaining position. Friction with Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) would have affected the narrative and, perhaps, led to a bigger overall loss. This kind of flexibility is missing in the Opposition camp. All the tall talk of a common ideological purpose is hokum.Third, the road ahead for the Congress remains bumpy. One of the reasons why some of the parties are reluctant to work with Congress is that it has not been able to recover from the 2014 defeat. This is the main reason why it is not in a strong bargaining position. The party doesn’t seem to have made much progress in building the organisation in important states such as UP and Bihar.Things would get more difficult for the Congress if it doesn't recover considerably in this Lok Sabha election. The party gained ground after the victory in the December 2018 assembly elections but has not been able to build on it. This election would also test the campaigning and vote-catching ability of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.  So, there is a lot at stake for the party. To be sure, it could have done more to bring the Opposition together in a meaningful way. That it hasn't been able to do so underlines its weaknesses."

title,General election 2019: How these seven Lok Sabha seats shape alliance dynamics
datetime,2019-03-20 20:27:00+00:00
description,"Some of these highly-contested seats include Palghar, Tumkur, Ahmednagar and Godda"
content,"As the Lok Sabha elections edge closer, and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) stitch up their respective alliances, one of the major hurdles that both camps are facing has been particular seats across the country.Political observers and party insiders have said the reasons why these seats are contested, and become a cause of contention between alliances differ according to states, but some of the factors remain constant, such as ego tussles, vote bank considerations and rivalries between individual leaders.Here are some of the seats which were part of the talks both before and after alliances were announced and, in some cases, where alliances were being considered but were eventually not forged.Palghar (Maharashtra)The Palghar Lok Sabha constituency in Maharashtra played a major role during the seat-sharing talks between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena.NoneMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis underlined the importance of the seat when he said a Sena candidate would be fielded from the region.Moreover, after the seat was given to Sena, several leaders from Palghar BJP had started resigning in protest. A BJP source had told Moneycontrol that the Sena was adamant on its demand to rub it in BJP's face after the former's defeat in a high-decibel bypoll in May 2018 in Palghar.Tumkur (Karnataka)The Tumkur seat in Karnataka has reportedly been a bone of contention between the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) alliance in Karnataka.NoneHowever, Tumkur is not the only seat that came in the way of the Congress-JD(S) seat-sharing talks. Seats like Uttara Kannada and Mandya, both with sitting Congress MPs and conceded to the JD(S), have also been hotly contested. In fact, Mandya has now turned into a prestige battle between the Congress-JD(S) combine and Kannada film star Ambareesh's widow Sumalatha. Ambareesh had represented the Mandya parliamentary seat thrice as a Congress candidate.Ahmednagar (Maharashtra)NoneAccording to reports, Sujay's switch to the BJP was a result of an old family feud, and the tussle between Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over the Ahmednagar constituency.Sujay was adamant about contesting from Ahmednagar, while the NCP wanted to field its own candidate in the seat. This was one of the reasons, according to reports, that the seat-sharing arrangement between Congress-NCP had been delayed. Senior Vikhe Patil had made an appeal to Pawar to consider Sujay as his grandson, but Ajit had announced that ""there was no question of the NCP relinquishing the Ahmednagar seat to the Congress"".A Congress bastion for long, BJP's Dilip Kumar Gandhi won from Ahmednagar constituency in 2009, getting re-elected in 2014.Karakat (Bihar)The Karakat seat in Bihar has been one of the many factors stalling the Grand Alliance's seat-sharing pact in Bihar.""Our leader represents the seat, there is no question of conceding it to anybody else,"" a Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leader told Moneycontrol. The leader was referring to former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha, who switched to the Grand Alliance's ranks from the NDA camp and who is an MP from the seat.The RLSP leader said Karakat, which has a mix of the Yadav, Rajput and Kushwaha population, is presenting a problem since even the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has been eyeing the seat and preparing to field its candidate from there. Both RLSP and RJD are a part of the Grand Alliance.Godda (Jharkhand)The Godda Lok Sabha seat in Jharkhand, currently held by BJP's Nishikant Dubey, is reportedly being eyed by both the Congress and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), part of a grand opposition alliance in the state.While the opposition alliance has reportedly announced seat-sharing arrangement, with the Congress contesting on seven seats, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on four, JVM on two and the RJD on one, both the JVM and Congress want to field a candidate from Godda.According to reports, Congress is not willing to give the Godda seat to JVM since it considers the seat one of its strongholds.Raiganj and Murshidabad (West Bengal) The two seats in West Bengal, currently being held by Communist Party of India (Marxist) MPs, have presented a problem for the Congress and the CPM seat-sharing talks.None"

However, he believes there is enough scope for growth and the company’s focus will be to penetrate in to regional markets going forward.In the soaps category, GCPL brands compete with Lux and Lifebuoy from Hindustan Unilever.Speaking about their insecticide business, Kataria said the company will focus on bringing new products which are making the differentiation and grow the category.The maker of Hit insecticides saw flat sales for the December quarter for its India household insecticides segment. The sales were hit due to deficient rainfall in the south.Hair colourKataria said that GCPL that has been a pioneer in disrupting the hair colour category, will continue to grow strongly in this segment by upgrading the consumers.""Our focus in the hair colour category will be to upgrade the consumers from bottom end of the category to formats like Crème. Hair colour also gives us headroom for penetration growth. So our task will be to get affordable accessible formats,"" said Kataria.He also pointed out that a critical task for the company will be to create more differentiation and bring innovation in that category which will help them to capture a larger pie in the hair colour segment.The Indian hair care industry has evolved to become Rs 23,600-crore, market with a growth rate of about 10 percent, according to a recent report by Nielsen.In the hair colour category, GCPL products compete for market share with Black Rose, Super Vasmol and L’Oreal.Godrej mostly controls the mass-end market, it has been upgrading its portfolio over the past few years.  It was the first to launch a hair-colour crème in a sachet at a market disruptive price, forcing competitors to try and play catchup with me-too offerings.GCPL owns 30 percent stake in Bhabani Blunt Hair Dressing, known for its B:blunt premier hair salon.

content,"For BJP patriarch L K Advani, it appears to be the end of road in electoral politics as his name did not figure in the first list of party candidates for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP chose to field its president Amit Shah from Gandhinagar, the seat held by Advani so far.Naranpura, from where Shah had won the Assembly election in 2012 before he became Rajya Sabha member, is located in Ahmedabad city, but falls in Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency.The BJP's state unit had demanded that either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Shah should contest Lok Sabha election from the state this time.State BJP leaders had also demanded that Shah contest from Gandhinagar, a BJP bastion.The BJP had sent observers on March 16 to seek opinion of party workers and leaders in Gandhinagar, and most of them favoured Shah, party observer Nimaben Acharya had said.Workers felt that as the seat had been held by a national leader (Advani), someone among the party's central leadership should contest from there, another party observer Prithviraj Patel had said.""Neither has the party approached him nor has he approached the party so far,"" Advani's personal secretary Deepak Chopra told PTI when asked if the BJP had urged Advani to contest from Gandhinagar yet again.Advani, 91, who has served as Union home minister and deputy prime minister, has won from Gandhinagar six times.Credited for orchestrating the BJP's rise to a pre-eminent position in the late 80s and 90s along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee after it won only two Lok Sabha seats in 1984.Advani was moved out of the BJP's highest decision-making body, Parliamentary Board, in 2014 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the party to victory and Shah was made its president.He was made a member of Margdarshak Mandal (group of mentors), a body which has never met.He did not make any representation to stake claim for Gandhinagar seat before the BJP observers.The BJP veteran won from Gandhinagar for the first time in 1991, and retained the constituency in 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014."

content,"NoneOn March 20, SpiceJet and InterGlobe Aviation rose 16 percent and 7 percent, respectively, while Jet Airways was down nearly 5 percent amid grounding aircraft.Likely consolidation in the industry and pricing power due to cash-strapped Jet Airways which grounded several planes in last one month could be pushing stock prices higher, experts said.""Consolidation is expected to happen in airline industry due to troubles in Jet Airways,"" S Krishna Kumar, CIO-Equity at Sundaram MF told CNBC-TV18.""The passenger yield moved up in last one year and capacity shrunk due to 737 MAX 8 problems & Jet Airways problem which led increase in ticket price. Hence, operators have been making lot of money and have great pricing power,"" he said.He feels companies with strong balance sheet are looking good for next two years.Directorate General of Civil Aviation, on March 20, released data for domestic air passenger growth in February which lost the high double-digit momentum and grew 5.62 percent, a 53-month low.Airlines flew 11.34 million passengers in month gone by, compared to 10.74 million in previous month.Significantly, almost all major carriers operated a truncated schedule, mostly led by the crippled Jet Airways and budget carrier IndiGo which had to cancel hundreds of flights in the month due to a host of reasons.These include cash-crunch, pilots shortages, NOTAMs (notice to airmen) at various airports and a reduced capacity due to grounding of some planes, among others.IndiGo retained its top position with a market share of 43.4 percent, carrying 4.93 million passengers in February, while the cash-strapped Jet along with its subsidiary Jetlite slipped to a distant fourth position carrying 1.28 million passengers and had a combined market share of 11.4 percent.Both Spicejet and national carrier Air India flew more passengers than Jet at 1.55 million and 1.45 million, and had market share of 13.7 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively.IndiGo, slipped to fifth position in OTP (on-time performance) at 76.2 percent during the month, while Spicejet's retained its leadership in average seat occupancy at 94 percent.The passenger load factor or seat occupancy has shown increasing trend primarily due to airlines offering promotional fares resulting in increased demand, DGCA said.Meanwhile, a media report suggested that SpiceJet could benefit from cash-strapped Jet Airways being forced to ground planes.The low-cost carrier is in talks with lessors to lease some of those aircraft, Reuters said quoting a person with direct knowledge of the matter.SpiceJet last week was forced to ground its 12 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 planes by India's aviation watchdog, following safety concerns after the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash that killed 157 people.SpiceJet and Jet Airways are the only carriers in India that operate this type of aircraft and have a total of about 400 on order. The airlines also operate the previous model, the 737-800 among other Boeing planes.The 737-800 makes up the majority of the Jet Airways fleet, and the airline is now operating only 41 aircraft, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Tuesday.That means around two-thirds of its fleet is grounded for non-payment to lessors, maintenance or other reasons.""Lessors are panicking as they haven't been paid and if Jet goes for insolvency, their planes will be stuck in India, so many of them are chasing SpiceJet,"" said the person quoted earlier.The person said SpiceJet needs at least twelve 737s to cover the grounded MAX planes and it is negotiating for more. Jet Airways pilots are also queuing up to join the budget airline.Jet Airways' lessors have offered 50 aircraft to SpiceJet, according to a report by news wire IANS."

description,The most significant difference between the new AirPods and its predecessor is the chipset used in them
content,"NoneDesignAt first, both the AirPods look identical but the newest one has a LED indicator on the front of the wireless charging case. Apple has added a green charging indicator that informs the user about the charging status when placed on a Qi-compatible wireless charging mat. The standard charging case, however, is exactly the same as the original AirPods. Both cases have the same weight and dimensions and are only available in White. AirPods 1 users can purchase the wireless charging case separately for Rs 7,500 in India which would be available ‘later this spring’.ProcessorThe most significant difference between the new AirPods and its predecessor is the chipset used in them. The original AirPods have a W1 chip inside them which already provides very efficient functionality and seamless connectivity. Apple has replaced the W1 chip with a proprietary H1 chip. Apple claims that with the new H1 chip, performance on the AirPods second generation has improved. The new chipset allows, even more, faster connection and switching between devices. Phone calls can be answered 1.5 times faster and the talk time has also been improved by up to 50 per cent. The biggest highlight, however, according to Apple is a custom audio architecture that would deliver higher quality sound from the H1 chip.Hey SiriSiri was available on AirPods 1. Users could double tap on either of the AirPods to invoke the voice assistant to make phone calls, play/pause music or adjust the volume. AirPods second generation makes the process a bit faster with the addition of ‘Hey Siri’. Users can say the two words followed by the task that they want the virtual assistant to do.Battery LifeWith the new AirPods, Apple states that battery life has been improved to 50 per cent. Users can expect up to three hours of talk time while using the AirPods second generation, thanks to the new H1 chip. The battery life for music playback, however, is the same five hours as the predecessor.Price"

title,2018 Mercedes-Benz C 300d review: A fun new entry into Mercedes' luxury world
datetime,2019-03-22 13:30:00+00:00
description,"Apart from a 245 hp four-cylinder engine, the C 300d is visually different from its lower powered counterpart too. What you get with the car is the AMG line body kit as standard."
content,"Mercedes-Benz is known for their high-class luxury cars and while it is the CLA that introduces you to the Mercedes family, the C-Class is what luxury driving is all about.The new C-Class may be just a 2019 facelift, but it certainly brings it up to date to compete with the newer rivals, and is available in two variants – the C 220d powered by 194 hp and 245 hp C 300d that we get to test.The C 300d is firmly different from its lower powered counterpart too. What you get with the car is the AMG line body kit as standard. This includes a more aggressive bumper, side skirts and a set of large 18-inch alloys. The diamond grille at the front comes down from the older C 43 AMG, giving it an extremely attractive profile, especially when viewed from the front. Also part of the kit is the 'Multi-Beam' adaptive headlamp that does a little dance when you start up the car.First let's talk about driveability. The engine is brilliantly refined as the 245 hp of power and 500 Nm of torque shoots you off the line thanks to the 9G-Tronic automatic gearbox. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time Mercedes introduced a BS-VI compliant engine on the C-Class cars. The car gets 5 driving modes namely, Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual. The reason I mention this is because the engine's performance is quite different on each of these modes. For example, the engine is tame and extremely easy to drive in comfort mode, even for someone new to driving. However, there is a very noticeable lag between stepping on the pedal and accelerating when trying to overtake. This is where the paddle shifters come in use. You won't be able to rev up high in comfort mode to keep you from jerking forward, so always shift down on the paddles when trying to pass that truck in front of you.But if you find an open road, switch to the Sport or Sport+ mode. This immediately stiffens your suspension and steering wheel. Your engine revs higher too and what sounded like nothing in Comfort now becomes a deep, throaty rumble. I've heard people say it sounded like a diesel, but personally, it wouldn't make much sense if it were silent in sport mode too. What is impressive though is the amount of power at the tip of your toes. A slight touch packs enough punch to pull away with a grin that is larger than your face.Mercedes says the C 300d can make a sprint time of 5.8 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h and while I didn't get to test that, they don't seem to be lying. You can feel the large wheels of the car every time you hit a sharp bump, but over the outgoing C-Class, ride quality is a whole lot better with slightly softer suspension too. It's good to see what Mercedes has done to improve the quality especially with the quick and easy steering and fairly limited body roll in any mode.What are the interiors like you ask? Like you would expect from Mercedes. The steering wheel is all new, and is similar to the S-Class with metallic buttons and two touchpads, and it gets a flat bottom thanks to the AMG line kit. Behind the wheel are analogue dials sandwiching a digital display. It is extremely informative but the C-Class' international counterpart gets an all-digital display and we would've been happier if we saw it here too.You do get the standard 10.25-inch infotainment display however. This is large and crisp with a high resolution display and uses the COMAND interface that is available in the E-Class and S-Class. I am a little disappointed it is not a touchscreen unit however, and it can get a little confusing when using the touchpad below after connecting your phone using Android Auto. Below that, the open-pore wood trim is a lot nicer than the varnished one on the outgoing C-Class. This makes it less prone to scratching and is honestly, quite a bit classier too.The seats are something to talk about, however. The front two seats are brilliant as they are electronically adjustable to a fair degree, and it comes with a large plush seat with decent under-thigh support. The rear however seems just a tad bit cramped. With the front adjusted to my preference, my passenger had a little to complain about in terms of leg space. And this is not a car for three people in the back. That is probably obvious but while there is enough space on the back seat for three people to be comfortable, the transmission tunnel leaves the person in the middle with absolutely no where to put their legs. There is also a surprising lack of under-thigh support in the back with no room for adjustments."

content,"NoneThe Supreme Court on March 14 asked Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh, referred to as Singh brothers, to consult their legal and financial legal advisers and revert to the Court by March 28 as to how they propose to secure the award, which has been passed against them.The Japanese drug maker is trying to enforce an arbitration award of Rs 3,500 crore it secured from a Singapore tribunal against Singh brothers in January last year. Daiichi alleged that Singh brothers had concealed information about Ranbaxy regulatory problems with the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) while selling the company in 2008 for $4.6 billion, of which $2.4 billion went to the brothers.Meanwhile, back-to-back SEBI orders on March 14 and 19 directed Religare Enterprises and Fortis Healthcare to recover Rs 2,315 crore and Rs 403 crore, respectively, that were diverted by the Singh brothers and their related companies. The market regulator set a three-month deadline for Singh brothers to refund the money.Religare has already initiated the recovery proceedings through corporate insolvency resolution process under Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 against Singh brothers and their entities.NoneGiven the meltdown of their wealth, it looks a tall order for Singh brothers to arrange those funds.But a person who knew brothers told Moneycontrol said a significant portion of their wealth is locked in real estate assets. “A large portion of the money the brothers received through sale of Ranbaxy was routed into buying real estate,” said a person who didn’t want to be named.But there is a problem, says the above person, as “the investments into real estate was made through an intricate web of companies and it’s opaque.”Gurinder Singh Dhillon, the spiritual head of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB), his family members and companies controlled by them are said to be in control of some of these properties. Dhillon is a father like figure for the Singh brothers.NoneNoneShivinder now blames his brother Malvinder solely for the troubles. He alleged his brother diverted funds from group companies while he retired from corporate life at 40 and was spending time doing spiritual and charitable work at RSSB. He also tried to distance himself from the whole Daiichi-Ranbaxy deal, saying that he was not involved in the negotiations and wasn’t part of the arbitration proceedings."

content,"If you have an all-equity portfolio then it makes sense to evenly distribute your money in various sectors, and not be focused on just a few sectors.If your portfolio requires a churn then this is the right time as we are on the verge of a breakout above previous record highs.Both Sensex and Nifty are less than 3 percent away from their respective record highs, and if the momentum continues we could touch those levels in March series itself.Election-specific volatility will continue and experts advise investors to remain with sectors that are showing strong momentum and will continue to do so.The important point to keep in mind is the sectoral weight in the portfolio. If it is too skewed towards one sector then the fate of your portfolio will also be dependent on the performance of that particular sector.Financials is one sector which tops the list for most brokerage houses. In financials, experts feel that private banks should outperform PSU Banks and NBFC peers, given the advantages of liquidity and quality franchise.Goldman Sachs in a recent note said that they have increased the cyclicality in their sector allocations and upgraded PSU banks, industrials and autos to overweight. It downgraded tech, metals, and NBFCs to underweight. Thematically, Goldman prefers domestic cyclicals over defensives and exporters.Among financials, Goldman Sachs upgraded PSU Banks to overweight given sharp improvements in asset quality trends, attractive valuations and likely pick-up in credit growth (as banks come out of narrow banking/PCA and likely gain some market share from NBFCs).Anecdotal evidence also confirms that capital goods, banks (private and PSU) and autos perform well during an election year, Elara Capital said in a note.We asked experts as to how would they distributed Rs 100 in different sectors:Analyst: Shivendra Foujdar, Founder and Managing Partner, Avighna TradesIf this is an all-equity portfolio then one should allocate 30 percent in banking, especially in PSU banks like PNB, Canara Bank, Bank Baroda and SBI.Apart from that, 20 percent in auto & auto ancillaries which include stocks like M&M, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, GNA Axle and Motherson Sumi.20 percent into infra and real estate-related projects like DLF, NCC, NBCC and IRB Infrastructure. 10 percent in cement stocks which are related to infra projects. Cement is the essential commodity to participate in a country's growth.10 percent in beverages sector like UBL, United Spirits, Radico Khaitan. And lastly, advertising & media is also a good sector to invest in so remaining 10 percent should go to stocks like Zee Entertainment, TV-Today, and TV-18 Broadcasting.NoneAnalyst: Dinesh Rohira. Founder & CEO at 5nance.comWe will allocate about 30 percent towards FMCG and two-wheeler sectors which have presence in rural geographic.We expect agri-based specialty chemical sectors (stock-specific) to benefit from recent freebies announced by the government for rural farmers and should have an allocation of about 20 percent in the portfolio.Investors can also allocate about 30 percent to select housing finance and private banks that provide an opportunity for investors to benefit from a rebound in credit growth, and also likely to benefit from falling borrowing cost.Further, government's thrust for Digital India is likely to benefit IT sectors (stock-specific) through massive spending on this front in medium term and thus should allocate about 20 percent in the portfolio.None"

She had an arranged marriage and while everything was okay pre-marriage, post-marriage she realised her husband was extremely secretive about money, so much so that after 7 years together she had no clue how much his salary was!He did not want to touch her money and insisted on living a frugal life while saving for the future from his income alone. While she was not extravagant, she did want to enjoy a decent lifestyle and indulge in experiences which gave her pleasure.She was painfully aware that it was possible to do all of this and still build a financially secure future if they could work on their combined income. After trying her best to be accommodative, she finally decided to part ways. She still shudders at the thought of how possessive he was with all his material acquisitions.Another soon-to-be-married couple were on the same page on everything, it was quite obvious to me that they had similar backgrounds and values and seemed compatible. That said, they were uncomfortable discussing money.They had chalked out a plan, drawn a monthly budget and decided to pitch in 50–50 for all the household expenses and each one would not be answerable to the other on what each one did with their surplus.Being married for 20 years and having interacted with several couples and having had deeper discussions about money, I knew that there could be some grey spaces in such a plan.What if, post-marriage, one of their parents/siblings needed financial help? Was it only one person’s responsibility or would it be a combined decision?If they decide to start a family and one of them decided to take a break to care for the child, what happens to contributions? Could they really be comfortable if one of them was extravagant and spending on things which the other one could not relate to? These are some questions which definitely need answers.Apart from initiating conversations and building comfort, it may help if you pay attention to how involved their family is in these decisions. Discuss how things are different in your family, this will ensure you build comfort and are not awkward talking money.Exchange credit reports, which can be insightful and help you understand the person much beyond a few discussions. It would also be a good idea to together meet a financial planner who specialises in pre-nuptial counselling on money matters, to help take out some of the awkwardness which one might have.In western countries, such discussions before marriage are common and couples even have pre-nuptial agreements. While in India we might still culturally not be comfortable with pre-nups yet, this is a discussion that you should not put on the backburner.To know a person fully, it is important to know their attitude towards money. This is a critical step towards being truly ready for your happily-ever-after story."

content,"NoneNoneMicrofinance institutions (MFIs) have truly come of age. The segment emerged relatively unscathed by the liquidity crisis that engulfed the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) since September 2018. That doesn’t come as a surprise as MFIs are well placed on liquidity front as compared to other segments of the non-bank finance sector. One, unlike many other NBFCs, average asset maturity tenure is generally lower than the average liability maturity tenure for MFIs. Two, most MFIs rely on banks for their liquidity needs, which is relatively a stable funding source as compared to mutual funds.While most NBFCs were busy managing liquidity or raising funds in the last 4-5 months, MFIs continued to focus on growth. The same is evident in total gross loan portfolio of non-bank MFIs (NBFCs-MFIs), which grew 44 percent year-one-year to Rs 60,694 crore as of December 31, 2018.NoneBut before getting into financials of CAGL, what's behind our interest in the microfinance sector, which historically have been on a roller coaster ride?NoneRural India, comprising two-third of households, contributes around 47 percent of GDP. However, rural areas account for only 10 percent of the outstanding bank credit, indicating low credit penetration. This offers enormous growth potential to MFIs.In addition to sector’s demonstrated resilience and growth potential, some of the structural changes has made microfinance a promising sector. The sector is thriving with eight MFIs converting into small finance banks (SFBs) and one of largest MFI (Bandhan Bank) transitioning into universal bank. Moreover, acquisition of Bharat Financial – the largest MFI -- by IndusInd Bank has added to the dynamism of the sector.The marginal profile of borrowers, unsecured nature of lending and political risks remains key concerns for the sector.NoneCAGL has significant rural presence with close to 82 percent of the customers in rural areas. It primarily provides income generation loans to rural customers through the joint liability group (JLG) mechanism.Credit risk, which is inherent in any financing business, is generally lower in case of lending through JLG. The access of personal information of each group member and social pressures are the key reasons for the same. However, the JLG model can prove to be a double-edged sword — containing risks in good times, but triggering large-sale defaults during a crisis.Karnataka accounts for around 54 percent of the company’s portfolio, exposing it to risks associated with a significant regional concentration. However, CAGL’s regional concentration will continue to reduce as it scales up through its district-based expansion strategy.What we like about CAGL?NoneNoneNoneNoneIn the past, CAGL’s profitability was impacted with RoA falling to 2.3 percent in FY17 from 3.6 percent in FY16 on account of additional provisioning arising out of steep deterioration in its asset quality post-demonetisation. However, with an increase in currency circulation and the management’s focused collection efforts, asset quality improved in FY18.With gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at 1.2 percent as at December 31, 2018, asset quality is currently reasonable. However, its asset quality remains highly vulnerable due to exposure to low income group. But predominantly, its week collection model, prudent customer on-boarding and monitoring provides comfort to an extent.NoneAt the current market price of Rs 474, the stock is trading at 2.4 times FY20 estimated book value. Given the strong earnings growth and ability to generate RoA of over 3-3.5 percent, valuations looks reasonable. Incidentally, the valuation of the last deal in this space between Bharat Fin and IndusInd Bank was at 3.8 times one-year forward book.Though on a relative basis, valuation appears at a premium when compared to SFBs like Ujjivan Financial Services and Equitas Holdings' operating in the micro-lending space. While investors can play the sector through SFBs, a lower cost structure, higher returns and potential to convert or being acquired by a bank makes a pure-play MFI like CAGL a worthy contender and should support the stock's relatively higher valuation.Long-term investors, with the ability to shoulder inherent risks associated with microfinance business and looking for high-quality business operating at the bottom of the pyramid, should buy the stock.Follow @nehadave01None"

title,Student claims partial withdrawal of his IIM-B email putting his career at risk
datetime,2019-03-21 16:52:00+00:00
description,"Institute says only feature to shoot emails has been blocked, student still can get emails from prospective recruiters."
content,"The 29-year-old student of Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIM-B), who was expelled from campus following complaints of misconduct now claims that the institution's move has jeopardized his career.The MBA student claimed that the institute has terminated his email id, he has not been able to keep a tab on the offers coming his way. The final year student claims he was offered a job by a premiere firm but is now unable to communicate with them and the process is hence stuck in a limbo. However, IIM-B authorities said only facilities to shoot out emails were blocked, and that the student still receives emails on the id.The student’s email id was blocked after he had sent out personal, non-academic mails to his batch mates to ensure his grievances are heard. IIM-B officials stated that they suspended the email id at the behest of the members of the student body, since it is against prevailing rules to use the college mail id for non-academic purposes.In a letter handed to him by the authorities, it is mentioned that following complaints received from several students and an alleged misconduct in the campus on February 9, they decided to ask him to leave the campus. The student claims he had only raised his voice against fellow students because he wasn’t being able to focus on his studies due to the ruckus created outside.He was allowed to stay on after he pointed out the impending exams. But, there was another complaint of misconduct against him, this time from the residents of the girl’s hostel, and he was expelled from the campus completely. Nonetheless, the institute states he was not barred from taking part in any academic activity.IIM-B authorities said: ""He wrote the first examination with all other students, but requested separate seating for the second examination, which we provided him. For the third and last exam, we arranged for a computer in the computer centre for him to take the examination, but he declined.""Commenting on the allegations that he was not even provided adequate stationery by the staff to write his exams, the institute stated: “It is beyond anyone’s imagination that IIM-B cannot provide stationery to students writing an examination. It is from his emailed answer to the Program Office that we learnt of the manner in which he had chosen to answer his exam.”Speaking on the student’s claim that he was not allowed to take part in group discussions and presentations, the official said: “It is not correct to state that he was not allowed to take part in academic activities. Based on a written complaint from his fellow students and the student body, IIMB asked him to vacate the hostel and stay with the parents but continue all academic activities. His group members have helped him by providing him with all the project details and submission deadlines.  There was absolutely no restriction on his academic activity.”The student also junked media reports published by a leading English daily which stated he suffers from poor mental health but didn’t get adequate support from college authorities. However, he claimed that he approached the counsellor attached to the institute on the insistence of college authorities, but no one was available to tend to him. IIM-B authorities mentioned that they extended all required support to him, informed his parents and had them come over to take care of him too."

content,"It has been a neck and neck race between Indian film production house and music label T-Series and a YouTube channel run by a Swedish-born vlogger/gamer Felix Kjellberg to become the most subscribed channel on the video-sharing website. NoneOn Friday morning, PewDiePie led the race with 90,698,769 subscribers against T-series which had 90,669,152 subscribers.While PewDiePie may be ahead of T-series for now when it comes to the number of subscribers, it lags behind in terms of number views. The music label has more than 65 billion views overall to date for its music videos which is three times PewDiePie’s count of less than 21 billion lifetime views for “let’s play” videos, vlogs and comedy sketches.The rivalry between the two channels has only made PewDiePie and T-series the two most-subscribed channels on YouTube.The music label’s growth has been rapid so much so that it went ahead of PewDiePie with more than 30,000 subscribers as of March 21 which has been the biggest margin yet. Thanks to the latest trailer of the Narendra Modi biopic which gathered over five million views in less than 16 hours. The battle between the two YouTube channels, going on since October 2018, has kept the internet at large engrossed in this fight. In India, Bollywood celebrities too joined the online battle with actors like Salman Khan, Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor and John Abraham urging the netizens to subscribe to T-Series' channel on YouTube. The Mumbai-based entertainment conglomerate had 30 million subscribers during the start of 2018 and now has over 90 million subscribers. The growth comes on the back of rapid recent internet growth of India’s internet user base. Internet subscribers grew 28 percent from 446 million in December 2017 to 570 million in November 2018. One in eight internet users globally is Indian. And this signals that the war between T-series and PewDiePie is only going get intense. While PewDiePie’s war with T-Series is seen as the native creator standard-bearer up against a corporate entertainment interest, the latter has been tapping into the creativity of independent YouTube creators. The company partners with creators to produce songs and dance covers, and also sign key YouTube music talent as artists such as Shirley Seitia. "

Most of Indians are insecure but that is the psychological insight that drives people to take as much as they can, which is not a good credit behavior because you have to repay it at the end of the day.There is no shortage of needs, so we give them a product where money is approved and is there for them, but they do not have to use it. The interest and tenure can be worked around as per the withdrawal from the MoneyTap. Once you qualify you just don’t get a loan but a credit line, wherein you withdraw small amounts for as low as 2 months and as long as 3 years, as little as Rs. 3,000 and as much as your eligibility. The upper limit is up to 5 lakhs.

description,"Apollo plans to add 10-15 clinics every year going forward, and has also tied-up with ApnaComplex, a company that manages apartment complexes, gated communities and co-operative housing societies to setup Society Clinics."
content,"NoneIt plans to add 10-15 clinics every year, and has also tied up with ApnaComplex, a company that manages apartment complexes, gated communities and co-operative housing societies to setup society clinics.Initially, Apollo plans to launch 100 such clinics in cities starting with Bangalore, Pune, Chennai and Hyderabad, and it plans to extend the chain to eight more cities with over 500 centers over the next 3 years.A society clinic will operate out of a small place allotted by the apartment society and will provide health consultations, tests, health checks, vaccinations, and a pharmacy.  A dedicated nurse will be present through the day, while a physician from Apollo is made available at specified time, the entire set of Apollo specialists will be online or will be on call.Apollo so far has a network of 77 primary health clinics across 34 Indian cities and one in Qatar.  Half of those clinics are managed by Apollo, with the rest being franchised.In a franchisee model, the partner puts the entire investment of setting up the clinic and running the operations while Apollo extends its brand, network eco-system, guidelines on standard operating procedures and shares knowledge. Apollo charges a one-time license fee, and an ongoing license fee based on revenues.The clinics division was founded in 2002 with an aim to capture a pie of primary healthcare market that’s largely unorganized led by doctor-driven clinics and nursing homes.Apollo Clinics typically operate out of 5,000 square feet integrated facilities that offers specialist consultation, day care procedures, dentist, diagnostics, preventive health checks, and pharmacy all under one roof, at a price point lower compared to hospitals.The small clinic model is nimbler, and allows Apollo to locate facilities in neighborhoods that are closer to where patients live and where leases for smaller spaces are typically cheaper, reducing overhead.Apollo can also focus on the services that are most relevant to the local communities and equip it appropriately, reducing fixed costs.It takes around Rs 3 – 3.5 crore investment to put up a clinic, and would require 2.5-3 years to break even.Apollo was trying a model at a scale that never had any precedent, and things sometimes didn’t pan out as anticipated.“This model is capital intensive, both on the capex and opex front, and our growth has been measured,” said Anand Wasker, COO, Apollo Clinics, in an interview to Moneycontrol.“Over the years, we have experimented with cities and partners. We had faced some rough weather in the previous five years. During that time, we have parted ways with some of the partners and shuttered down clinics that didn't do well,” Wasker said.Wasker says an organized primary healthcare model will take some more time to catch up and it would need lot of investment."

title,Market linked debentures in favour again; should you invest?
datetime,2019-03-22 10:54:00+00:00
description,"CARE Ratings expects issuances to increase to Rs 14,000 crore by the end of this financial year "
content,"Much of the debt market is still reeling under the after-effects of the Infrastructure & Leasing Finance Services Company’s (IL&FS) debacle. But there’s one financial instrument that appears to have benefitted from the devastation. This instrument is market linked debentures (MLD), also known as structured notes.According to report titled ‘Market Linked Debentures: Issuances at its all-time high’ by CARE Ratings, the net outstanding MLDs grew to Rs 21,191 crore as on December 31, 2018 as against Rs 11,356 crore as on September 30, 2017  and Rs 32,165 crore as on June 30, 2017 (when they hit a peak).Financial year that begun on April 1, 2018 has so far seen issuances worth Rs 12,910 crore.Experts attribute the strong uptick in the issuances of MLDs to two factors - the necessity of corporates to raise funds in a tight market and investors looking for some extra returns on post-tax basis.That sounds like a win-win situation. But is it so simple and should you even go near it?Why MLDs have made a comeback?Ashish Shankar, head-product advisory, Motilal Oswal Private Wealth Management says, “The supply of money from both banks and mutual funds to NBFCs has dried up after the IL&FS issue. But NBFCs have to raise money to fund their growth and to pay for existing bonds’ maturities. So they have taken the MLD route.”Issuances of MLD works in favour of NBFC in multiple ways. It lets an NBFC issue additional 5 ISINs apart from limit of 12 for NCD in a year as per SEBI mandate. Put simply, an NBFC can raise money more number of times.Each ISIN stands for each issue of debt instrument issued by borrower. It also helps them raise 25% of their borrowings from capital market, as it is a guideline by regulators on large borrowings. MLDs help service debt with one payment at the time of maturity, whereas most NCDs expect issuers pay interest at regular interval in the form of pre-determined coupon.Going forward, more issuances of these products are expected as more NBFCs line up for raising more capital. CARE Ratings expects issuances to increase to Rs 14,000 crore by the end of this financial year.What does an MLD offer?For the beginners, MLD are of two types – principle protected and non-principle protected. They are issued for the period of 13 months to 60 months and generally require minimum investment of Rs 25 lakh and more. Unlike a bond that pays a fixed interest either monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually, MLDs do not pay any regular income. Your income from an MLD comes only at maturity.This is how it works: An MLD is linked to some underlying financial security like a stock market index such as Nifty or a 10-year government security paper. As there is no income to be had during its tenure, the gain from an MLD is ascertained at the time of maturity, depending on how its underlying asset has moved.For example, if an investor has bought an MLD which is linked to movement in Nifty with a promise to pay 70% movement (participation, as it is termed) in Nifty, then at the time of maturity if the Nifty has moved 50% (point to point), then the investor takes home his principle plus 35% (70% of 50%) return.Here, at the maturity, the investor would see a payoff equal to 135% of principal invested. Note that Nifty may have actually moved up or down in the interim, but it’s final position at the time of MLD’s maturity is accounted for to ascertain how much money it pays you- the investor- at maturity.An MLD being a debt instrument- even though it could be linked to an equity instrument like Nifty- may come with a credit rating. The participation rate can be higher to entice investors, if the MLD come with a lower rating. In the past, MLDs have come with a variety of credit ratings ranging from ‘AAA’ (connotes the highest level of creditworthiness) to ‘AA’ or even an ‘A’ rating; the latter of which denotes low credit worthiness of the borrower (the firm that issues the MLD).This may sound too attractive. But in case of non-principle protected MLD one may see losses also, if the underlying security goes down. Of course, they offer higher participation in the movement of underlying index or security.Each issuer is free to choose the underlying index or security with which the payoff for investor is linked. This underling index or security could be nifty, bank nifty, 10 year government bond yield, gold. The idea is to choose a security which is widely traded and not easy to manipulate.As per CARE Ratings, principle protected MLDs account for approximately 95% of the issuances in nine months ended December 31 2018. “Investors prefer to invest in the principle protected MLD because they are sure that there downside is protected. And they have to risk only on the upside and credit risk,” says Prateek Pant, head of products and solutions, Sanctum Wealth Management.Though the MLDs come with tenures ranging between 13 months to 60 months, the average maturity of MLDs issued has been 2.85 years in nine months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2.92 years in financial year ended March 31, 2018.“Investors are seen opting for principle protected MLD with AAA rating that mature between 24 months to 36 months,” said Nishant Agarwal, managing partner and head- family office, ASK Wealth Advisors. The fall in average tenure of MLD is partly attributed to reduced investor appetite arising out of increased uncertainty in the market.Tax efficient…Though the investors are worried about the increasing risks in fixed income market, there is a tendency to pick these MLDs in high networth individuals given the tax treatment they attract.Like all other listed bonds, long term capital gains earned on listed MLDs are taxed at 10%, if MLDs are sold after a year. Bond funds impose a long – term capital gains tax 20% (after indexation) on gains on investments, if held for 36 months. Interest income earned on traditional fixed deposits and debentures is taxed at marginal rate of tax.After the payoff is ascertained just before the maturity of the MLD, the investor sells the MLD on the exchange close to fair value. This ensures that his gains so realised are taxed as long term capital gains at 10%. And the remaining amount of money is taxed as interest. This can best be understood with an example.An investor buys an MLD at Rs 100 and the expected payoff at the time of maturity is Rs 135. Just before the maturity, the MLD is sold on the exchange at say Rs 134. Here, Rs 34 is taxed as long term capital gain.If Investor A sells his MLD to investor B and investor B sells his MLD to investor A, then both of them will book large part of their gain as long term capital gain. Remaining return, if any (Re 1 in this case) will be taxed as interest earned at marginal rate of tax.If the investor does not sell the units and receives the payoff as maturity proceeds, then the same will be taxed as interest at marginal rate of tax. A point to note is, capital gains on unlisted MLDs are taxed at 20% rate of tax post indexation if held for 36 months. And if held till maturity, proceeds are taxed as interest. All short term capital gains are taxed at marginal rate of tax.Ashish Shanker says, “The favourable tax treatment of listed MLDs helps the high networth individuals pocket substantially more returns than they would otherwise earn on other comparable fixed income options.”Stable issuers such L&T Finance, Tata Capital Financial Services, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services are an added attraction to high networth individuals.“Investors across the risk spectrum are opting for MLDs since this allows them to create pay out in line with their risk profile and investment preferences. For example, an aggressive investor will be looking at outperforming the markets using MLD’s by investing in a product with higher participation. The conservative investor may be willing to accept lower participation and higher certainty of returns,” says Gaurav Awasthi, Senior Partner, IIFL Wealth Management.…but highly complexWhile MLDs appear to be juicy, these are highly complex products. It is not a plain vanilla bond offering and the outcomes may vary based on the movement of underlying securities. Two MLDs issued by the same issuer may have diagonally opposite payoffs and investors should not be blindly signing above the dotted line.The money raised through MLD is used partly in the business activities of the NBFC and partly to buy derivative instruments to be able to pay you back your money. Like any other bond, MLD too come with credit risk. Whether MLD pays off investors at maturity, depends partly on how the underlying instruments have moved (linked to the participation rate) and how the company itself performs, that is recovers money from its businesses.If the underlying security moves in the opposite direction, investors just get their principal, and nothing else, back. Lower ratings connote higher risk. “AA rated MLDs offer more participation than their AAA rated counterparts,” says Agarwal while explaining that high returns come with high risk. Return of capital is an important parameter and one should ignore it while chasing return on capital. Prateek Pant says, “We stick to good quality names while advising our clients on MLD and do not go below AA rated papers.”The ability to manage the derivatives book is a tricky area. “Investors look at nifty linked debentures as they can generate extra returns than Nifty. However one must understand that the issuer should be continuously managing his options positions right. Investors should not ignore this risk while buying MLDs,” says Feroze Azeez, deputy CEO, Anand Rathi Private Wealth Management.Some issuers prefer to enter into forward agreements to buy and sell options to mimic the agreed payoffs on their MLDs outstanding. This ensures low costs but they come with high counter-party risk. Some issuers prefer to trade long term options on the stock exchange which nullifies counter-party risk.Though principle protected MLDs are listed on stock exchanges, they are rarely traded. You should be prepared to hold on to your investments till maturity.“Investors should also understand that they have to get the quantum of move in the chosen direction and time taken for that move right to make money in products where promised returns are high. Getting both right is a difficult call,” says Vishal Dhawan, founder and chief financial planner, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisor."

description,Chennai dominated proceedings with both bat and ball as they bundled out Bangalore for just 70 runs before chasing down the total with 14 balls to spare.
content,"Chennai Super Kings (CSK) ensured their title defence got off to a winning start with a dominant seven-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the opening match of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on March 23. Playing in front of their home crowd, Dhoni and co. dominated proceedings with both bat and ball as they bundled out Bangalore for just 70 runs before chasing down the total with 14 balls to spare.NoneNoneEarlier in the game, MS Dhoni won the toss and opted to bowl first. Chennai started brilliantly reducing Bangalore to 39/4 after 8 overs thanks to a great opening spell by Man of the Match Harbhajan Singh who finished with 3/20. The RCB batsmen fell to poor shot selection on a track which offered great purchase for the spinners. Parthiv Patel was the only RCB batsman to record a double digit score as the spinners wreaked havoc. Tahir and Harbhajan finished with 3 wickets apiece and Ravindra Jadeja chipped in with a couple with Dwayne Bravo wrapping up the innings by getting Parthiv caught out on his very first delivery.Turning pointDhoni’s team selection and Harbhajan Singh’s early spell were the definite turning points of the game. Harbhajan sent back Virat Kohli, Moeen Ali and AB de Villiers while giving away just 20 runs in his 4 overs. Even Shimron Hetmyer was run out on the last ball of Bhaji’s spell leaving RCB reeling at 39/4 after 8 overs.Best DismissalJadeja’s brilliant catch to dismiss de Villiers was a delight to the eyes. de Villiers who was dropped by Imran Tahir on the previous delivery once again went for the slog sweep but this time Jadeja came charging in from deep midwicket and put in a full length dive to take a superb catch.Batsman of the MatchDespite his teammates failing to cope with a spin-friendly track at the Chepauk, Parthiv Patel showed great composure at the crease finishing with 29 off 35 balls. He resisted the temptation to go for the big shots opting instead to work the ball along the ground picking up 1’s and 2’s while hitting just 2 boundaries. His knock was significant as none of the other RCB batsmen finished with double-digit scores.Bowler of the MatchNoneWhat’s nextChennai travel to the capital for their next game on March 26 as they take on the Delhi Capitals.

content,"Rival captains Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli expressed their dissatisfaction over the slowness of the Chepauk track as the opening IPL encounter turned out to be damp squib. While RCB were out for 70 in 17.1 overs, CSK scored the runs in 17.4 overs and Dhoni made it clear that he would expect better wickets in the coming games.""We were really surprised by how slow the wicket was. It reminded me of a Champions League wicket in 2011 after we won the IPL. The wicket definitely needs to be much better, even with dew it was spinning big,"" Dhoni said at the post-match presentation.Kohli, who is also the Indian captain, on his part said: ""The wicket looked much better than it played. We though 140-150 would be an ideal score. A scrappy sort of start but either team would have struggled batting first.""Dhoni, who had correctly assessed the track at the toss said that any genuine spinner will do well on this track.""80, 90, 100 is really low-scoring and if you have geniune spinners in your line-up you can create a lot of trouble. We need to score runs as well, ours is a batting attack where batsmen like to play their shots and you can't control the toss which means that we might have to bat first in matches as well,"" Dhoni said.""Other teams have good spinners as well and this isn't the pitch we are looking forward to,"" the CSK skipper added.For Kohli, the relief was that a match like this happened at the start of the tournament.""No one wants to start like this, but it's good to get a game like this out of the way - this early in the tournament. We spoke of trying to be in the game, taking it to the 18th over which was nice to see,"" the RCB captain said.""The batting wasn't good, it wasn't easy to bat on, looked much better surface though, I thought 140-150 would have been an ideal score, especially with dew expected later on."

title,Technical Classroom: How to use technical indicators to enter and exit a position
datetime,2019-03-24 12:00:00+00:00
description,Indicators which give early signals of entry and exit are known as leading indicators while Lagging Indicators are stock trading technical indicators which indicate the change in the trend or momentum after the actual market action.
content,"Chandan TapariaIn technical analysis, indicators are of two types namely leading and lagging. A leading indicator leads the price, meaning it usually signals the occurrence of a reversal or a new trend in advance whereas a lagging indicator, on the other hand, lags the price meaning it usually signals the occurrence of a reversal or a new trend after it has occurred.NoneIndicators that give early signals of entry and exit are known as leading indicators. Leading indicators are those created to precede the price movements of securities giving predictive qualities.These indicators give us more opportunities to buy and sell. They can get you into a profitable trade earlier than lagging indicators, however, they are less reliable and can often lead to false signals. They represent a form of price momentum over a fixed look-back period, which is the number of periods used to calculate the indicator.One of the major advantages of a leading indicator is that it gives early signs of entry and exit than other indicators such as MACD. The drawback is that sometimes it gives a false signal of buy and sell. Leading Indicators also do not identify trend, unlike the lagging indicators.Two of the common leading indicators are:-RSI ( Relative Strength Index)-StochasticNoneLagging indicators are stock trading technical indicators that indicate the change in the trend or momentum after the actual market action.These trading indicators are the mathematical derivatives of price and volume. Some of them are derived from other indicators. These indicators generate buy and sell signals after the actual change in the trend. So, if a trader chooses to follow it, he will be entering the trade after some portion of the trend is already over. This late entry increases the initial stop loss. This negatively affects money management and risk-reward ratio.Since these trading indicators give trade signal after the actual change of trend, they tend to give less number of false signals. The loss due to the stop loss being taken out is reduced. They complement other technical indicators and help in confirming the trend.Some of the common lagging indicators are:-ADX Indicator-Bollinger BandsNoneThe author is Derivatives & Technical Analyst at Motilal Oswal.None"

title,Do you know these four Greek letters which are used in options strategy?
datetime,2019-03-23 12:51:00+00:00
description,"Most option calculators and option portfolio showcasing tools come equipped with the Greeks; hence, they are easily available across the internet."
content,"Shubham AgarwalIt is always profitable to go back to the books every once in a while, to make sure that the process of trading this complex instrument of ‘options’ remains simple and error free.In an attempt to do so let us try and revisit four such Greek letters which are often used while describing the option positions.We will try and define each of them at first and then follow the definition with a simple one sentence implication of the same on our profitability.In my experience, these four Greek letters are super powerful in summarizing our position across price, time and volatility dimensions no matter how large the position is. Hence, I believe they are the 'must-know' definitions for every trader.Most option calculators and option portfolio showcasing tools come equipped with the Greeks; hence, they are easily available across the internet.Also, all these Greeks change with a change in price and time, but would at least help us understand where we stand right now.Let us go in further detail:#1 Delta:Delta is the rate of change of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying. Deltas can be positive or negative.Deltas can also be thought of as the probability that the option will expire ITM or in-the-money. Having a delta neutral portfolio can be a great way to mitigate directional risk from any adverse market moves.Utility: Look at this number as a representation of our position in the underlying. Positive 0.50 delta means the option position represents long 50 percent of exposure in the underlying and vice-versa.#2 Gamma:Gamma is the rate of change in the delta of an option. Gamma values are largest in ATM or at-the-money options and smallest in ITM and OTM or out-of-money options.Gamma sensitivity exponentially increases as expiration nears. Gamma is important to keep in mind when hedging deltas because low gamma positions require less maintenance than high gamma positions.Utility: As we all know options rise exponentially with price and the factor that adds this compounding element to option premium is Gamma. For us, the takeaway is Positive Gamma is Pro-Direction, while Negative Gamma is Pro-Consolidation.#3 Theta:Theta measures the rate of change in an options price relative to time. This is also referred to as time decay. Theta values are negative in long option positions and positive in short option positions.Initially, out-of-the-money options have a faster rate of theta decay than at-the-money options. However, as expiration nears, the rate of theta decay for OTM options slows while the ATM options begin to experience theta decay at a faster rate. This is a function of Theta being a much smaller component of an OTM option's price, the closer the option is to expire.Utility: Theta number has to be looked at if we are going to hold an option for one more day. For long option, the negative Theta number is the amount of money that would be lost with the passage of one more day.#4 Vega:Vega is the Greek metric that allows us to see our exposure to changes in implied volatility. Vega values represent the change in an option’s price given a 1 percent move in implied volatility, all else equal.Utility: Time and again when we have talked about event trading and how the concept of implied volatility first raises premiums ahead of the event on the expectation of volatility and drops the premiums as the unknown is over.Vega lets us know for the position held what is the money that can be lost if the implied volatility were to drop by 1 percent. It is very useful to track this, especially with the mega event of the Lok Sabha polls around the corner.This brief is an introduction to the utility of these 4 Greek letters. Each of them is a  subject in itself, and a lot has been written on them.I would urge to raise familiarity on these Greeks as much as possible because Greeks are like X-Ray reports of the option portfolio – knowing them helps instantly figure out the health , and more importantly devise a possible remedy.(The author is CEO & Head of Research at Quantsapp Private Limited.)"

They have asked Goyal to step down immediately and make way for a new management. As per the plan, Goyal's stake will likely be capped at 10 percent by diluting the rest at a nominal value.NoneNoneEarlier this month, Reuters had reported that Goyal had agreed to step down as Chairman and reduce his 51 percent stake in the airline. The report had said that Jet Airways' lenders may invoke Goyal's entire stake in the airline, and start looking for a new buyer in the coming weeks.Saddled with more than $1 billion of debt, Jet Airways is struggling to stay afloat. It has delayed payments to banks, suppliers, pilots and lessors - some of which have forced the airline to ground as many as 40 planes.Jet Airways has survived a near-death experience once before; in 2013, Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways injected $600 million of capital for a 24 percent stake in the airline, three London Heathrow slots and a majority share in its frequent flyer programme. The infusion helped the airline pare down its debt and fight growing domestic competition."

description,"Eight months into the trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world's two largest economies, it is unclear if a deal acceptable to both sides can be done."
content,"US President Donald Trump's blunt-force use of tariffs in pursuing his ""America First"" trade agenda has angered many, from company executives to allied governments and members of both parties of Congress.But there's one effort which has drawn broad support from those who oppose him on almost everything else - his push to force Beijing to change what are widely viewed as China's market-distorting trade and subsidy practices.As US-China talks to end a trade war reach their endgame, politicians, executives and foreign diplomats are urging Trump and his team to hold out for meaningful structural reforms in China to address entrenched problems in the relationship that hurt US and other foreign companies and workers.Trump's trade war ""has let the genie out of the bottle"" by lifting expectations that the trade war will force China to reform policies that businesses and foreign governments regard as unfair, said Steven Gardon, vice president of indirect taxes and customs at Lear Corp. Gardon's firm is an automotive seating and electrical supplier with plants in 39 countries, including the United States and China.""Now that all these issues have been raised, there's a lot more domestic political support to address these issues, and I don't think you can pull back from that,"" Gardon said at a Georgetown Law School forum this month. ""There's now pressure politically that they have to be addressed for the long term.""Gardon's comments reflect a broad shift in US and international business sentiment towards China's economic and trade policies, one that is aligned with Trump's goals, if not his tactics.Trump's trade team say they are in the final stages of negotiating what would be the biggest economic policy agreement with China in decades. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin head to Beijing this week to try to accelerate talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. Liu is set to travel to Washington for another round of negotiations in early April.Eight months into the trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world's two largest economies, it is unclear if a deal acceptable to both sides can be done.China's President Xi Jinping is seen as reluctant to make economic reforms under pressure from the United States, and Trump has said he may keep tariffs on Chinese goods in place for ""a substantial period"" even if a deal is struck.Xi may find it easier to live with the tariffs Trump has imposed on trade than to change China's model for economic development.As part of a deal, Beijing has offered to make big-ticket purchases from the United States to help reduce a record trade gap. Trump's team has said those purchases would be worth more than a trillion dollars over about six years.While big Chinese purchases might be tempting for Trump's administration, they would do nothing to address what U.S. firms competing in China or against Chinese firms say are structural problems with a system stacked against them.The United States complains China engages in systematic intellectual property theft, forces foreign firms to give up trade secrets for market access and spends huge sums subsidizing its own industry. Redressing those complaints would require policy reform at the highest level from Xi and China's ruling Communist Party.A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in late February showed that a majority of member US companies supported increasing or maintaining tariffs on Chinese goods, and nearly twice as many as last year want the U.S. government to push Beijing harder to create a level playing field.The US tariff demands have even encouraged some reform-minded Chinese officials and private-sector business executives to call for a faster pace of reform in China as it celebrates the 40th anniversary of its first steps toward capitalism.Lighthizer told lawmakers in late February that Chinese-American business people in particular have urged him to ""hang tough"" in the talks and not to ""sell out for soybeans.""STAY THE COURSEWhen Trump delayed a threatened tariff increase well before a March 1 deadline for a deal, he stoked fears that he may be swayed by the big purchase order and leave longstanding structural problems unresolved.Since then, a steady drumbeat of lobbyists, company executives, foreign diplomats and US lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to stay the course on his structural demands.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, one of the most pro-trade Republicans and a critic of Trump's tariffs, recently joined that call.""While we want China to buy more US goods ... it's even more important for us to hold China accountable to meeting high international standards on intellectual property rights, subsidization, overcapacity, and the other structural ways in which China distorts the global economy,"" he said at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing just days after the tariff delay was announced.Last week, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a longtime China trade hawk, took to the Senate floor to urge Trump not to ""back down"" and take a deal based largely on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and other goods.On March 21, Schumer tweeted: ""Now's not the time to drop $200B in tariffs just because China's close to a deal, @realDonald Trump.""QUIETLY ROOTING FOR TRUMPEuropean Union members, traditional allies of the United States, are still smarting about the steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed on imports into the United States last year. The EU is also worried that Trump will impose duties on autos. But the bloc shares many of the same frustrations over China's technology transfer policies and market access constraints.""We get complaints every day from our companies,"" one European official told Reuters in Beijing, noting that despite repeated pledges from the Chinese government to make life easier for foreign companies, little had changed.EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom's assessment of China's behavior sounds almost like it was written by the US Trade Representative's office, charging that China has abused global trading rules.China has ""blurred the lines between state and private sector. The state has undue influence,"" she said in a Washington speech this month. ""Intellectual properties of companies are stolen. State subsidies, direct or indirect, are common. And these impacts are felt at home and abroad.""Malmstrom says that while the US and EU ""agree on the diagnosis,"" they differ on tactics, and she argues for a more multilateral approach, citing the EU's work with the United States and Japan to address the issues through reform of World Trade Organization rules.Some worry that Europe could lose out if Washington and Beijing strike a deal to purchase billions of dollars more in products to try to shrink the US goods trade deficit with China.""If China is buying more from America then inevitably it will buy less from Europe,"" a second European official based in Beijing said, adding that could in particular affect large European multinationals.But European diplomats and officials acknowledge a begrudging support for Trump's goals, even if they are repulsed by his blunt tactics. Many are secretly rooting for his success.""We are against unilateral measures, but nobody is exactly sorry for China. On content we think he does have a point,"" said one EU diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity in Brussels. ""Beijing has to understand that without reform, the system could just stop working.""Trump administration officials insist that he has gotten the message and is holding out for ""structural changes"" to the US-China relationship, along with an enforcement mechanism that holds China to its pledges.Clete Willems, a White House trade adviser, told the Georgetown Law School forum that Trump is determined to fix problems with China's trade relationship that he has railed against for years, long before he ever sought office."

We know the quality of such people,"" he said.The Sena chief also taunted the Congress and the NCP over a string of leaders from both the parties defecting to the NDA partners in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.""I do not know if anybody is left in the Opposition camp to contest against us. At this rate of exodus...I hope the BJP will not induct Sharad Pawar into its fold one day,"" he quipped.Thackeray announced candidature of Narendra Patil from Satara Lok Sabha constituency, who will contest against NCP stalwart and sitting MP Udayanraje Bhosale.Out of the total 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, the BJP and the Sena will contest 25 and 23 seats each.In the seat-sharing deal announced Saturday, the Congress and the NCP announced to contest 24 and 20 seats, respectively, while leaving four seats to smaller allies under the aegis of the ""United Progressive Mega-Alliance"".Meanwhile, the BJP has announced candidature of Sunil Mendhe from Bhandara-Gondiya constituency in east Maharashtra.His opponent will be Nana Panchbudde of the NCP.Nana Patole had won the 2014 general elections on a BJP ticket from Bhandara-Gondiya by defeating NCP stalwart Praful Patel.Patole later fell out with BJP leadership and resigned as an MP.

description,"There are plenty of young minds taking big steps to save the environment and create a sustainable future, back at home too."
content,"Last week saw one of the largest protest rallies organised by students across the globe. What began as a lone man’s struggle got media recognition in no time and spread like wildfire. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg’s proactive efforts to save the world from the politics of garbed environmental concerns made her a Nobel Peace Prize nominee and inspired thousands of young minds to embark on the path of the green crusade.While there is no discrediting Thunberg’s efforts and spirited activism, there are plenty of young minds taking big steps to save the environment and create a sustainable future, back at home too.We take a look at some of the little great minds who have been instrumental in altering the landscape of sustainable development in their respective home turfs.NoneHer efforts were also recognised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who lauded her for the impeccable upkeep of the lake.A native of the picturesque Haridwar, the 11-year-old was instrumental in bringing forth a climate change petition in the country. Ridhima was just 6-years-old when the 2013 floods wreaked havoc on the landscape. Thus began her journey of petitioning against the government before the National Green Tribunal, highlighting how it failed to address the issue of climate change scientifically.NoneAnother conscientious Kashmiri, who comes from a very humble background, decided to clean the Wular Lake. Bilal, a ragpicker, collects garbage littering Wular Lake. After his father passed away, the teen began cleaning up the lake, hoping it would earn him enough to help sustain himself. However, his efforts earned him that and more. In 2017, he became the brand ambassador of Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) to inspire others to take up a noble cause. His life and works were also celebrated in a documentary film ‘Saving the Savior—Story of a Kid and Wular Lake’. Bilal has so far cleared nearly 12,000 kg of trash.NoneThe 16-year-old Bengaluru student started a website to unite people fighting to save the city’s largest lake. The teen resides in an apartment located in the catchment area of Bellandur lake. Unfortunately, over time, locals converted the waterbody into a dumping ground. Despite this, authorities did not bother to take any action to resuscitate it. That’s when the teen started an online campaign for the same.NoneThis teenage entrepreneur runs a company that recycles used tyres without degrading the environment. His company collects old tyres and recycles them into fuel and steel, fit for use.NoneAnother Bengaluru teen, she raised Rs 7,000 to clean up a lake. The 14-year-old decided to revive the Chunchaghatta Lake in Bengaluru that was turned into a garbage dump. It was a collective effort by the residents of the area and Ridhi also volunteered. She went from door to door, crowd sourcing money to clean the lake.7.

title,"Viewpoint | Listed MNCs in India: a good catch, but an opportunity slowly fading"
datetime,2019-03-25 08:31:00+00:00
description,"It is a roller-coaster ride for MNCs - the listing requirements add to overheads, and also require country-specific disclosures which MNCs are not very comfortable with"
content,"Jatin KhemaniA basic tenet of long-term investing is to look for high quality listed businesses. This essentially implies 1) they earn returns above cost of capital (reflected by return on capital employed), and 2) generate strong free cash i.e. they don’t require a lot of capital (fixed assets and/or working capital) to grow revenues and profitability. Those retained earnings can then be utilised either to acquire other companies in same line of business or diversify. Alternatively, excess capital could be returned to shareholders via dividends or buyback.But have you ever wondered why would a promoter of such a business list his company as it involves diluting a significant chunk of his ownership to minority investors?For instance, why is a business like Castrol listed? It generates annual revenues of Rs 4,000 crore. On a gross block of merely Rs 220 crore, (a staggering 18x asset turn) and enjoys a negative working capital, which helps it generate an RoCE of over 100%. Since it hardly needs any capital to grow, it pays out 75-100% of its profit every year as dividend.If I was promoter of such a business why would I divest even a single share? This is true for almost all the multi-national corporations operating in India – be it FMCG companies like Nestle and Colgate, host of high-tech capital goods and fast moving industrial goods or auto ancillaries like Schaeffler.We analyzed top 40 Indian-listed subsidiaries of MNCs and found that the average fixed asset turns is 6.3x, average return on capital employed is a whopping 36%, barring five, all are debt-free and net-cash companies while the average dividend payout is 35%. And this brings us back to the fundamental question, why are they listed?After all, stock market, primarily, is a medium for businesses to raise capital in order to fund their growth (or retire debt). Accordingly, majority of the listed businesses should be the ones which are capital intensive like infrastructure companies or ones which constantly need capital to grow, like banks or NBFCs.If that was completely true, the investable universe for us would have been 1) much smaller and, 2) much poorer in terms of quality from a long-term standpoint.This forced some of the highest quality businesses to either get listed or exit from India. Since they didn’t need even a dime of capital, these IPOs were mostly offer-for-sale by global parent companies and the most lucrative part was that these issues came out at face value or slight premium to face value. Clearly, a lottery for Indian public market investors of that time.Following are some interesting statistics and timeline from that eventful era:1. There were over 850 MNCs operating in India at that time. Roughly 400 were unaffected by this new regulation as they already had Indian partners or they were exporting significant part of their production and bringing valuable foreign exchange to India.2. From the remaining, about 100 were asked to leave India while rest were supposed to bring down ownership or voluntarily shut down Indian operations.3. About 70 companies that found the terms unacceptable began to wind up operations in India and exited by 1980. This list included giants like Coca-Cola, IBM, Exxon Mobil and Kodak. This period was very challenging for entrepreneurs looking to start a new business in India. A firm would have to get the green flag from up to 80 agencies before it was granted a licence to produce in India. Further, each industry had a cap on licences, usually four or five for the whole nation, creating a monopolistic market. Businesses focused on procuring licences rather than on improving their services and products. This was a huge advantage for incumbents as they could continue to grow with no threat of new entrants. In this context, it must have been a very painful decision for these MNCs to surrender their licence and exit from a big market like India.4. Rest of the companies diluted equity to Indian investors to comply with the new guidelines. This led to a mad rush of MNC IPOs and some notable ones were following:None5. Environment finally changed when India opened up its economy in 1991 with liberalization, privatization and globalization (LPG) policy. MNCs which had exited India came back and some did so with vengeance. When Coca-Cola re-entered in 1993, it acquired all the local cola brands- Thums Up, Limca, Citra, Rim Zim, etc. which flourished in its 15 years of absence. Reportedly, Coca-Cola paid $40 million for all these brands and killed competition at one go. Today, it dominates India’s carbonated soft drink market with a 60% share.6. Later, FDI policy was relaxed and slowly most of the sectors were allowed to have 100% foreign ownership. During the dot com burst, there were 25-30 open offers by MNCs to increase their stake (for eventual delisting) and around 50+ were in the pipeline, however, many could not be completed successfully due to subsequent recovery in stock market. The MNCs that could opportunistically delist their Indian subsidiaries included names likeReckitt Benckiser, Cadbury, Philips, Panasonic, Ray Ban, Otis, Carrier Aircon, Sandvik, Infar, Wartsila, among others - these were all dream businesses to own for public market investors, however, they were now taken private.7. Similarly, during the global financial crisis of 2008, the stock market crashed and there was a series of open offers and delisting announcements by MNCs, though, only a few could be successfully completed because of a swift V-shaped recovery in market. In some cases, the parent entities had raised their stake from 50-60% to as high as 70-80% while hoping to eventually de-list Indian subsidiaries as and when the next opportunity arises (i.e. next bear market).8. However, there was an additional jolt caused by a 2010 regulation which made it mandatory for listed companies to have minimum 25% public shareholding. Many companies like Fresenius Kabi Oncology, Alfa Laval, Sulzer India chose to pay up in an open offer and de-list, instead of diluting their stake down to 75%.It has clearly been a roller-coaster ride for MNCs - the listing requirements add to overheads, and also require country-specific disclosures which MNCs are not very comfortable with. Given a chance they would like to have just one firm, the parent entity, to be listed in the home market.As a matter of fact, with every bear market this sub-set of Indian listed subsidiaries of MNCs has been shrinking and in turn shrinking the investable universe for a quality focused long-term investor.(The author is the founder & CEO of Stalwart Advisors www.stalwartvalue.com), a SEBI registered investment advisor)"

title,B.Voc: Few takers for a course that makes students job-ready
datetime,2019-03-24 13:29:00+00:00
description,Almost 30-40 percent seats have been vacant in the programme across 200 plus institutes that offer the course
content,"It has been five years since the University Grants Commission (UGC) launched the Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc.) degree. The concept was exciting and the course structure offered flexibility. But lack of awareness and inadequate placements have led to poor uptake of the programme.Almost 30-40 percent seats have been vacant in the programme across 200 plus institutes that offer the course.Unlike a traditional degree that is given as a qualification for most jobs, B.Voc is still a distant cousin of the B.Sc, BA and B.Com degrees. Students are unsure about the job prospects considering that vocational education is perceived as one leading to blue-collar jobs in factories.The three-year programme is supposed to promote skill development-based curriculum in higher education. The course structure has been designed for students wishing to upskill and increase their employability.Any student completing their senior secondary examination is eligible for the three-year B.Voc degree programme. The course fee ranges from Rs 40,000-5 lakh. While those placed have received even a Rs 10 lakh annual salary package, the number of companies recruiting are low. This has dissuaded others from opting for the programme.Unlike other educational programmes, this course offers students the flexibility to opt out after one year. Those dropping out early get a one-year or two-year diploma certificate, though companies are not eager to recruit these dropouts.Despite, the flexibility is leading to dropouts among the people who pursue the programme even as the class strength remains low.Considering the low interest, almost 30 institutes have either removed the course from the list of undergraduate programmes or have barely any full-time faculty to teach.While the intent of the programme was to promote specialised skills in sectors like technology, health, crafts among others, lack of awareness about the perceived job opportunities after completing the programme has been a factor of poor uptake of this course. Further, students have been unable to realise that flexible entry and exit points limit their employability opportunities.At a time when all companies are demanding a skill-based education system in order to have job-ready candidates, programmes like B.Voc could be a game changer with their industry-specific theory/practical courses. The key here will be to bring it to the mainstream like the other undergraduate degree programmes."

Chief Executive Vinay Dube is expected to stay on board the 25-year-old airline Goyal set up with his wife in 1993.NoneJet Airways has a Rs 8,000 crore debt and has not been able to furnish instalments for loan repayment, which led to the grounding of over 75 aircraft in its fleet. Many of its pilots have got truncated rosters in March.The financial woes have also led to non-payment of pilot salaries. The distressed airline, which is urgently seeking a resolution plan to overcome serious liquidity crunch, has been delaying salaries to its pilots. At present, a major chunk of the December salary, and that of January and February are pending. In fact, the pilots have threatened to stop flying from April 1, if the dues are not cleared by March-end.On March 20, Moneycontrol reported that Jet Airways' lenders had worked out an alternate rescue plan for the debt-ridden airline, which involves taking majority control and reconstituting the entire board of the country’s second largest carrier."

The SP with its limited strength in West Bengal will extend its support to Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress in its fight to politically wipe out the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, SP vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda said.""We have left two seats for Congress in Uttar Pradesh and three seats for Rashtriya Lok Dal (of Chaudhary Ajit Singh). But the Congress has decided to fight in 73 seats of the state. We would like them to put up a good fight,"" Nanda said while addressing a press conference here.At 80, Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of Lok Sabha seats polling for which will take place in seven phases.""We have heard that Congress president, apart from his seat of Amethi in UP would also contest election in other states such as Karnataka or Kerala. This shows the real picture of Congress's organisational strength in Uttar Pradesh,"" he said.Defending the decision to leave only two seats for the Congress in UP in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, Nanda said in the 2017 state assembly polls, his party had forged an alliance with the Congress but it had failed to make any impact.The Samajwadi Party has entered into a pre-poll alliance with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), besides the RLD.""The SP-BSP-RLD alliance will sweep UP.

content,"Employees in the technology sector have made it clear that they will quit companies with sexual harassment cases. A survey by job site Indeed said 87 percent women employees and 82 percent male employees would be ready to quit their job if there were any incidents of sexual harassment or biased hiring at their company.However, 95 percent respondents would be more likely to stick to the job if their company was transparent about the issue in question and made attempts to correct it.The survey also found that close to 70 percent considered changing their jobs depending on the nature of the scandal, their loyalty to the firm and how well, or poorly, the employers handled these situations.Further, 80 percent of respondents said they were more likely to report misbehaviour in the wake of last year’s public offences, with women (85 percent) more likely to do so than men (76 percent).Unethical practicesApart from misconduct instances, employees are also not in favour of any unethical practices including hiring bias and data breach.Close to 80 percent of respondents said they would be likely to leave their job if a technology-based issue such as data breach, product failure occurred at the company for which they work.Overall, only a little over 10 percent of respondents said they were less eager to work in the tech industry as a result of public offences such as data breaches, sexual harassment exposures, disingenuous privacy practices, and so on.Employees with career duration of five years or less were more likely (56 percent) to consider leaving their company following a transgression, in comparison to 46 percent of respondents, who with longer career duration of up to 10 years, were less likely to do so.Interestingly, 72 percent of respondents who work in a company with 250-500 employees said their companies were part of a public scandal in 2018, while only 46 percent of respondents who work in a company with more than 500 employees said the same.

description,"An investor can purchase and sell units of a gold ETF on the stock exchange. He/she, however, needs a demat account to purchase the units of gold ETF"
content,"Gold is back on the table as an investment option. The prices for the yellow metal have increased 6.2% in the past year.Overall, Indians have always been one of the larger consumers of gold. Some invest in mutual funds that invest in gold and some prefer to invest in sovereign gold bonds. And since gold in the paper form, such as a gold mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, is available throughout the year, it becomes a matter of convenience for individual investors to stagger their investments.Gold mutual funds are of two types – gold exchange traded funds (ETF) and gold savings funds. As the name suggests, gold ETFs are mutual fund schemes that invest in gold and are listed on the stock exchanges. These are passively-managed funds - the fund manager’s role is limited to buying bullion gold of 99.5 purity and keep it with the scheme’s custodian.This is done to mimic the price performance of the physical form of gold. Put simply, gold ETFs are expected to offer returns similar to that offered by physical gold, before scheme expenses and tracking error. Lower the tracking error, better it is for the investor. Expense ratio for these funds range between 0.55% and 1.18%, according to Value Research -a mutual fund tracking firm.An investor can purchase and sell units of a gold ETF on the stock exchange. He/she, however, needs a demat account to purchase the units of gold ETF.A gold ETF negates the need to hold and store physical gold. But it has one drawback: it doesn’t allow you to do a systematic investment plan. Also, one may find it painful to keep placing buy orders at regular intervals on the stock exchange.A few brokers allow purchase of gold ETF units at a predetermined interval, say monthly or weekly using Equity Systematic Investment Plan (Equity SIP). However, in that case the investor needs to specify the number of units to be bought at the time of each purchase. Not everyone is comfortable with such an arrangement.To overcome all these issues and allow investors to buy gold ETFs of a fixed amount per month (or at a regular interval of choice) without insisting on a demat account, the mutual funds came out with gold saving funds.These are feeder funds that buy units of gold ETF. These schemes allow investors to make SIPs and help them allocate money in a staggered manner. Of course, this convenience comes at an additional layer of costs.The expense ratio for these funds hover between 6 basis points to 1.82 percent. Note that this is over and above the costs charged by underlying gold ETF in which the gold savings fund invests.Effective April 1, 2019, ETFs' maximum total expense ratio will be capped at 1%, whereas for the fund of funds the same will be capped at 2%."

description,"India will grow at 7 percent, Sensex and Nifty stocks can have earnings growth of low double digits but there will be few stocks from small midcaps basket which will grow at 30-40-50 percent CAGR for next 3-5-7 years."
content,"Arun Mukherjee, Soumya Malani""You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity – a piece of a business – to gain your financial freedom""-Naval Ravikant.”The time certainly couldn’t get any better to get hold of quality business ownership at bargain prices. It is looking like a new beginning, a new start. Let’s discuss some scenarios in a few lines and then we can connect the dots.I am always right!The most dangerous trait of an investor which you should avoid at any cost is that you are always right. The moment you realize you are wrong - get out of the position.Don't intellectually rationalize why you should hold. It will emotionally drain you. Just sell. Survive first. Nothing else is more important.Markets simply don't care about your purchase price. Keep a close eye on all your portfolio bets. If any of the story changes, be ruthless in exiting them.Don’t sell your winners to average your losers:Don’t sell your winners to average your losers. Never try to time markets. Only God and liars can predict consistent top and bottoms.Investors who wait for the bottom would never be able to capitalise on any deep correction as nobody knows what the real bottom would be. The way is to keep deploying funds whenever and wherever you feel comfortable. That's how the stock market works.Every up move is different than the others:Valuations don't always fall to the same level in every fall as every fall may be of different degree in the market cycle. Also, this present fall was only in price. Earnings didn't fall.To the contrary, most companies reported very strong earnings for the last 2-3 quarters making some room on the valuations side. We believe the bull market in India which could run for many years with intermediate corrections.Formula of Multibaggers:In terms of our experience, any stock that has the following lethal combinations or a set of them would have massive potential to be a big multibagger:Visionary management + scalability + pricing power + tailwinds + high growth + higher incremental RoCE + low equity + under ownership + leader in a niche area = combination of a multibagger.What’s happening now?A lot of investors are still in disbelief as to why smallcaps have started moving up. Looks like a bottom finally got formed in the small and midcaps.We feel that the recent geopolitical concerns gave Modi massive mindshare and market is slowly factoring him in. We know so many quality small and midcaps companies where crazy distress selling happened.In the market, even in investments these days most are leveraged. You pledge existing holding of yours to raise money for buying more stocks.A lot of that lever got triggered in markets which resulted in pledge invocation and selling by brokers in those client accounts.They ought to recover big. A lot of stocks are so oversold that a tiny bit of buying would make them move 30-40 percent on the higher side in no time. Always remember it's the cycles that make huge wealth.Anyone who played the last bull cycle of 2014-2017 properly would agree that it was life-changing one where portfolios went up by 4-5-7-10x and so on.Present Market View:It is the companies and not markets which will make one richer. For sure sentiments dampener, irrationality and short-term investors impulsive emotions can well play spoilsport but over the longer haul rationality would be in for sure as the only thing that remains constant and matters the most is the fact of earnings growth and PE rerating based on that.One thing over the last 12 years that we did learn or noticed was the fact that if you want to make it big as an investor in the market you need to have detachment with money.In bad times or uncertain days, it gets extremely tough for one to endure such severe notional losses. Up moves or corrections will come and go but individual good quality companies would always help you make big money sooner or later.India will grow at 7 percent, Sensex and Nifty stocks can have earnings growth of low double digits but there will be few stocks from small midcaps basket which will grow at 30-40-50 percent CAGR for next 3-5-7 years.They are bound to create huge money in the longer run. Just need to have the confidence and the conviction to back them. In the long run what counts remain earnings. Sanity too would be in vogue.Happy investing guys!!(Arun Mukherjee and Soumya Malani, who hail from Kolkata, are partners in Equity Wealth, a SEBI-registered investment advisory firm.

Applying for an Apple Card is possible within the Apple Wallet app itself. Users can sign up for the card in the app and get a digital card that can be used for payments. Users can track expenses on a daily, weekly, monthly and even category-wise basis. There is also a physical titanium credit card which does not have any other information apart from the Apple Logo and the card holder’s name below it. This also means that there is no CVV, credit card number, expiration date, and signature that are usually found on traditional cards. All this information is stored in a special security chip used by Apple Pay called Secure Element.Apple is releasing the credit card with an assurance of no late fees, no annual fees, no international fees, and no over-limit fees. Besides that, the company would also not charge penalties to users for late payments and offer lower interest rates as well. Users would get a cashback of two per cent for through Apple Pay by using the Apple Card and three per cent for making purchases from Apple’s services itself.

title,Opinion | Rahul Gandhi's NYAY reflects Congress’ flexible economic ideology
datetime,2019-03-26 15:29:00+00:00
description,"To understand the Congress President's proposed Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY), it is important to understand the grand old party's shifting economic outlook since Nehru."
content,"Rasheed KidwaiCongress President Rahul Gandhi’s Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Minimum Income Scheme) or, in short, NYAY, which means ‘justice’ in Hindi is in keeping with Congress’ economic thinking of ‘social left and economic right’. The pre-poll announcement has a potential of a game-changer and blunting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s muscular politics and hyper nationalism.Rahul, 49, has some understanding of economy and has reportedly been in touch with economists Thomas Piketty and Angus Deaton to address the Indian model of economic disparity between the rich and the poor. Privately, Rahul is said to have often wondered that if huge non-performing assets (NPAs) of industrialists can be written off, why shouldn’t India’s poorest of the poor get a basic income. According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report, corporate loan defaults to the tone of Rs 1,08,500 crore and Rs 1,62,700 crore were waived off by banks in 2016-’17 and 2017-’18 respectively.A flexible thoughtSince Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s times, the Congress’ thinking has been fluid and flexible. Nehru’s biographer, S Gopal felt that even during the Nehru era, the real aim of the Congress was not so much to implement its declared policies but to ensure continuation in power. For this objective, the Congress under Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi accommodated men of different economic thinking even at the expense of the stated social and economic commitment to the country.From 1967 to 1972, Indira displayed her extraordinary political acumen and sense of realpolitik. She kept pitting one Congress leader against the other to deal a body blow to the conservatives during the bank nationalisation, abolition of the privy purse and the presidential polls that pitted Neelam Sanjiva Reddy against VV Giri. Chandrashekhar and others took on the high and mighty on the basis of her ‘stray thoughts’ at the stormy AICC meets in Bangalore, Bombay and Faridabad.Continuous changeIn the larger context, party leaders handling economic issues reinforce a stand that as an ideology, the party has been following the course of change with continuity. From Nehru to Sonia and Rahul, the party leadership has not followed any dogmatic or indoctrinated ideology. Successive Congress leaderships have instead chosen to reinvent, avoiding confrontations and sharp divisions in a multi-cultural and pluralistic Indian society.From its inception, the Congress functioned as an amorphous organisation. Describing the Congress at the Avadi session, UN Dhebar, president of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) in 1955, spoke extensively in poet’s flair in the presence of Nehru, Indira and others, who nodded their heads in approval. Dhebar said, “What is the Congress? It is a tear, fallen from the sufferings and agonised heart of humanity in bondage, coming to life.”According to Nehru, the Congress was always something more than a party and capable of drawing allegiance from millions who were not formally with the party. Speaking in New Delhi at the 1951 AICC session, Nehru said, “We have to retain something of that wider aspect of the Congress, but this should not lead to floppiness and loose thinking and an accommodation of all kinds of contrary opinions within its fold. In regard to principles – social, economic and political – this must be clear. There should be no room for reactionaries in the Congress fold. Nor should there be any room in it for those who seek, through its medium, personal advancement and profit at the cost of the public good. We have to pull ourselves up from the narrow grooves of thought and action, from factions, from mutual recrimination, from tolerance of evil in public life and in our social structure, and become again fighters for a cause and upholders of high principles.”Absence of ideological clarity In subsequent party sessions and position papers, the Congress clarified and explained that its concept of socialism was not dogmatic or indoctrinate. In 1972, under Indira, the election manifesto prepared for the assembly polls read, ‘Poverty must go. Disparity must diminish. Injustice must end.’ Earlier, at the Mumbai AICC session, Jagjivan Ram moved a resolution saying, ‘Modern man is the inheritor of all that is noble and good in human thought. And thus our democratic socialism is a synthesis of all that is best in the thinking of the East and the West and provides an ideology superior to other sectarian ideologies which are communalistic or communitarian.’In terms of ‘science of ideas’ or ideology, many feel the Congress’ strength lies in the absence of ideological clarity. Senior Congress leader Shriman Narayan Agarwal (who later dropped his caste surname) used to insist that the Congress ideology should not be interpreted in any rigid set of ideas whose acceptance was obligatory to all Congressmen.The culture of having a powerful, dominant leader and the tendency to change from time-to-time as per the political situation kept giving the Congress fresh ideological frames. These were more matters of policy than faith. Such a compromise between various interest groups helped in the sharing of power and the doctrinal pluralism of its leaders.By the time the Congress under Sonia met at Pachmarhi (1997), Shimla (2003) and Hyderabad (2006), the party had formally accepted the need for coalitions with parties of varying ideology. The political resolution in Hyderabad said, ‘At present, coalition of political forces and opinion is inevitable. Each political epoch needs a leader and a visionary who changes the traditional paradigm of society to face contemporary challenges.’Focus on the poorAway from public scrutiny, Sonia and Rahul have found Manmohan Singh’s economic thinking to be on the same page as theirs. The Gandhis do not believe in a State-controlled economy. Sonia’s lengthy discussions with Singh prior to 2004 had convinced her that a market-controlled economy, if properly guided, could benefit many, including those who were at the margins of society. Her understanding of the new world order and need for reforms contributed significantly to convincing the great Indian middle class and captains of industry that under Manmohan Singh, reforms would continue and there would be further liberalisation.Singh, too, made it clear that his government was not Sensex-driven, but functioned in a transparent, pro-industry, 24 Akbar Road, 252 pro-entrepreneur manner. In a nutshell, Sonia managed to communicate to the masses, even those who did not read newspapers or watch television, that the Congress’ prime responsibility towards the poor did not stand compromised by Singh’s economic reforms.Rahul had been contemplating to unleash a socio-economic programme that would help him score a point or two against Modi. This explains his frequent and often long trips abroad where he has supposedly spent some time with Piketty and Deaton. Rahul somewhere fancies himself as Indian version of Emmanuel Macron of France or Jeremy Corbyn of England.Rasheed Kidwai is a visiting Fellow of the Observer Research Foundation.

Moving on, she said the holy city is large, roughly 3,000 km in radius and has over 1000 villages, which makes it a “daunting task to be able to please every voter in the constituency.”NoneShe also took jibes at the Opposition and said five years was too less a time to develop all of Mathura since nothing had been done to give a facelift to the area in the past many years.Commenting on the recent burning topic – unemployment – the erstwhile star asked the media to avoid asking questions on allegations made by the Opposition that are “unworthy of discussion”.NoneNone"

content,"Royal Enfield has finally launched the Trials badged Bullets, something a lot of us have been waiting for. Like the Bullet, the Trials Works Replicas are available in a 350 and a 500 variant priced at Rs 1.62 lakh and Rs 2.07 lakh, respectively.In terms of appearance, the bikes are fairly similar to the standard Bullet. The Trials borrows the tank and the side panels directly off of the standard bike. Of course, to make the bike more off-road friendly, changes have been made. The front and rear fenders have been shortened and the handlebar is now slightly taller and features a cross-brace.The suspension too has been made taller adding a little more travel to account for bumps and dips that come while off-roading. The exhaust is upswept now for better water wading capability and the tyres have proper knobbies to help with traction. The rear seat too has been swapped out for a luggage carrier.What differentiates the Trials from each other and especially from the Classic series is the painted chassis and centre stand. The Trials 350 gets a red painted chassis while the 500 receives a green painted frame.In terms of mechanicals, however, the bikes use the same engines that are seen on the Classic series. The 346cc single-cylinder produces 20 PS of power and 28 Nm of torque and the 499cc single-cylinder churns out 27.5 PS and 41.3 Nm, so no change there. Transmission too is a five-speed gearbox and there is no change in the gearing."

description,"After a disappointing run in FY19, most experts feel that the worst might be over for small and midcaps and investors can start accumulating quality stocks on declines."
content,"Down, but not out! That boxing analogy has been true for the broader market in past year. Broader indices underperformed benchmarks by a wide margin.In the financial year 2019, S&P BSE Sensex has risen 15 percent and Nifty has jumped 13 percent as of March 22, 2019. In comparison, S&P BSE Midcap has fallen 5 percent and S&P BSE Smallcap index has dropped 13 percent in the same period.But a handful of smallcap stocks outperformed. As many as 28 stocks from the Smallcap index gave over 50 percent returns in the past year. And 6 out of 28 gave returns in triple digits.NoneNoneNoneNoneSelectively, mid & smallcaps have outperformed but as a theme, they suffered due to many factors. Higher valuations, SEBI reclassification norms, lag seen in earnings growth momentum, and corporate governance issues which surfaced in select stocks marred the attractiveness of the space.Foreign institutional investors were also net sellers of Indian equity in almost 8 out of the last 12 months, Moneycontrol.com data showed. They have pulled out close to Rs 50,000 crore from Indian equity market so far in FY19.Outlook for FY20After a disappointing run in FY19, most experts feel that the worst might be over for small and midcaps and investors can start accumulating quality stocks on declines.Historical analysis of midcaps reveals that (a) there has never been two consecutive years of negative returns; and (b) the positive returns in the year after negative returns have always exceeded the negative returns, Elara Capital said in a report.The relative valuation of midcaps compared to largecaps are at a historically low level, both at an absolute level as well as on a rolling basis, with 7 DMAs at 2014 levels, the report added.With four-year midcap – large cap premium practically wiped out, Elara now believes that valuations are reasonable to support midcap recovery.The financial year 2019 has been particularly good for largecap stocks as compared to the broader market. But, the trend could reverse as we move into FY20.Macquarie recommends moving their stance from large to midcaps, and on the sectoral front, it prefers moving from defensives to cyclicals. Real estate and its derivate sectors are likely to outperform in 2019, it said.From the midcap space, Macquarie likes Phoenix Mills, L&T Info, Minda Industries, Jubilant FoodWorks, Ujjivan, Apollo Hospitals, NCC, Crompton Consumer, ACC and Berger Paints.Earlier in March, Morgan Stanley in a report said that it expects Sensex at 42,000 by December 2019. The global brokerage further said the performance gap between largecaps and broader market has started to narrow but has a fair bit of distance to cover, so it expects the broader market to outperform.None"

title,Naresh Goyal & Vijay Mallya: The contrasting tale of two aviation entrepreneurs
datetime,2019-03-27 19:21:00+00:00
description,"In many ways, Goyal has been an antithesis of Mallya."
content,"The change in Naresh Goyal's stance was telling.He had been vociferous against the then UPA government's plan to allow foreign direct investment in the aviation sector. The FDI, if permitted timely, would have benefited competitor Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines, which needed immediate funding to clear debts, fly grounded aircraft and re-start truncated operations.But by the time the FDI nod came in September 2012, it was too late. Kingfisher, which was hoping to sell a stake to Etihad Airways, closed operations a month later. Its license was revoked in February 2013.Within a couple of months though, Goyal was singing a different tune. In April 2013, he stood proudly beside senior officials of - surprise, surprise, Etihad Airways - announcing the FDI into Jet Airways. The Abu Dhabi-based airline had taken a 24 percent stake in Jet Airways for Rs 2,050 crore.Goyal, the behind-the-scenes networker, had again got the better of his flamboyant adversary.Then and nowAnd now, six years later, the founder chairman of Jet Airways, has again done what Vijay Mallya couldn't pull off.Circumstances around Jet Airways in the last year couldn't have been more similar to what Kingfisher was facing in 2012. High crude prices and low fares led to piling debt and losses. And a bad acquisition (Kingfisher acquired Air Deccan, and Jet Airways bought Air Sahara) made a recovery an even more uphill task.Goyal has not just managed to keep Jet Airways afloat but also retain a stake in the carrier, while Mallya fled the country.Jet Airways lenders now have two months time to get a new owner for the airline.NoneMany agree. Mallya, who overnight turned from 'king of good times' to poster boy of crony capitalism, has valid reasons to be disgruntled, say industry insiders.""Jet Airways got a lot of support, including from the government, which Kingfisher didn't,"" says a senior executive from the industry.""He is totally right in complaining,"" says a former senior executive at a private airline. ""Mallya was undone by banks, government and the media,"" added the person.Different stylesThe two businessmen couldn't have been more different.One was an inheritor who ably shouldered the family business after the untimely death of his father and built it into the largest liquor business in the country. And Kingfisher Airlines, after its launch in 2003, seemed like a successful diversification.NoneIts brand embodied Mallya's lifestyle, which was by now making more news than the then-billionaire's business. Often pictured chomping on a cigar and with a beer in his hand, Mallya's diamond-studded ears sparkled for the shutterbugs, and he loved to pose with the scantily-clad models of Kingfisher Calendar.Goyal, who was now wary of Jet's fast-growing competitor, was an antithesis of Mallya.NoneWhile Mallya lived his life under public glare, especially after becoming a Member of Parliament, Goyal, a former travel agent, was away in London, after having turned an NRI. Even as he networked with the who's who of global aviation industry, Goyal preferred to let the professionals in the company brief the media or address analysts."

description,"GMR on March 27 said it has signed a binding term sheet with a consortium of a Tata Group company, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and SSG Capital Management for raising Rs 8,000 crore in its airports business."
content,"None“The board has in principle okayed and advised us this the way forward,” said Sushil Kumar Modi, Group CFO, Strategic Finance of GMR referring to the demerger.Modi said the process of demerger would start once the transaction with Tata Group, GIC and SSG Capital is consummated, and the board formally approves it. The company expects the demerger process to take around a year.“There are investors who like pure play, they don’t like coming into a holding company which is very complex,” said Saurabh Chawla, Executive Director, Finance and Strategy for GMR.“Energy is a different play, roads is a different play, airports are different, how does he evaluate it. When you have a pure play he will understand the business, become far more comfortable and give a much better valuation. It also helps to broaden the investor base,” Chawla added.Even the new investors who are coming on board, are believed to have been aligned with demerger proposal, said the official.After the demerger of airports business, GMR Infrastructure will be left with energy, roads, SEZ and coal mines.Focus on coreAirports business generates about two-thirds of GMR’s revenues and 90 percent of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the company. For nine months ended December 31, 2018, the airport business generated Rs 3,920.6 crore in revenue, while the other businesses contributed about Rs 1,975.77 crore.The company also said it is evaluating a sale of six road assets, SEZ with a license to build a port in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh and a coal mine in Indonesia where it has 30 percent stake.The company, which was earlier contemplating an initial public offering, had a change of heart, with the funds expected to flow from Tata Group, GIC and SSG Capital.GMR on March 27 said it has signed a binding term sheet with a consortium of a Tata Group company, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and SSG Capital Management for raising Rs 8,000 crore in its airports business.There will be an equity infusion of Rs 1,000 crore in GMR Airports, while Rs 7,000 crore will be used towards the purchase of its equity shares from the listed entity as well as its subsidiary. The total valuation assuming all earn-outs will be around Rs 22,475 crore. This includes Rs 5,000 crore free cash flows on books of Delhi and Hyderabad airports.The proposed investment is subject to regulatory and lender consents. After the transaction, Tata’s will hold a 20 percent stake for Rs 3,560 crore, GIC will have 15 percent for Rs 2,670 crore and SSG 10 percent for Rs 1,780 crore. GMR will provide exit to existing private equity investors—Macquarie-SBI Infrastructure Investments Limited, Standard Chartered Private Equity (Mauritius) III Limited and JM Financial Old Lane India Corporation that hold around 5.8 percent stake.GMR will retain 54 percent controlling stake, with an option to increase it to around 62 percent if it achieves earn-outs of Rs 4,475 crore, by issuing fresh shares.Deleveraging balance sheetThe proposed raising of funds is expected to come as a relief for GMR, which is struggling under a pile of debt and has been making losses for years.The deal will help reduce the company’s consolidated debt of Rs 20,000 crore to Rs 12,000 crore and bring down the corporate debt substantially.The corporate debt at the holding company level is at Rs 6,500 crore.After the transaction, Modi said the company will turn “PAT positive” in FY20, with finance costs almost getting halved.The finance cost of the company stood at around Rs 1,900 crore in the nine months of FY19.In addition to the cash pile of Rs 5,000 crore, and the cash generation from aero and non-aero revenues that includes real estate monetisation at Delhi and Hyderabad airports, Modi said the company will be easily fund the capex for ongoing expansion at both the airports, without depending on too much debt.GMR Airports is spending around Rs 14,000-Rs 15,000 crore on expansion of operating airports at Delhi and Hyderabad, in addition, it would need around Rs 4,000 crore for Goa and Nagpur Airports.GMR airport portfolio has around 159 million passenger capacity in operation and under development, comprising of India's busiest Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Mactan Cebu International Airport in partnership with Megawide in Philippines.While greenfield projects under development include airport at Mopa in Goa and airport at Heraklion, Crete, Greece in partnership with GEK Terna.The GMR-Megawide consortium has won the Clark International Airport’s EPC project, the second project in the Philippines."

content,"Over the past four years, three global automotive companies have announced detail plans for their India foray. At least two of these – Kia Motors and MG Motors – are in the final leg of launching their cars while PSA Peugeot Citroen will take a couple of years.A collective investment of around Rs 20,000 crore by the three companies is expected to come to India.While this may seem impressive, the list of companies and brands who have exited India, or are on the verge of closing down, is much longer. From companies producing heavy trucks to premium SUV makers, to manufacturers of commuter bikes, India's auto space has witnessed an exodus of foreign carmakers over the past five years.NoneNoneOthers such as Beiqi Foton, Changan Automotive, Great Wall Motors, Cherry Automobile, Geely, all headquartered in China as well as Volkswagen-owned Ducati had plans to have a manufacturing presence in India. These plans have largely remained on paper.Heightened competitiveness, change in company strategy, high debt burden and poor product and brand recall are some of the reasons why these brands have failed in India.For instance the joint venture company of Eicher Polaris, which saw an investment of more than Rs 350 crore, downed shutters in less than six years after the firm was incorporated. Its plant in Rajasthan that made a personal utility vehicle called Multix, remains closed.Korean SUV brand Ssangyong was pulled out from India last year when its parent company Mahindra & Mahindra decided to launch a SsangYong product, G4 Rexton, under its own brand. SsangYong was pulled out of India due to a very limited brand recall value with many even failing to identify the country of the brand’s origin.NoneWhile MAN shut down operations entirely, its sister concern Scania has exited the bus body making operations. VW group is instead rerouting investments to its car business, which includes the Skoda brand, to produce India-specific model.Another VW-owned brand Ducati, that makes premium performance bikes, had plans to have a completely knocked down (CKD) plant operation in India.

title,Why Apple is shifting its focus from hardware to software-driven services
datetime,2019-03-28 07:51:00+00:00
description,Subscription services are a perfect way of locking down consumers.
content,"If there was one thing missing from Apple’s keynote event, it was the strong presence of Apple hardware. Apple unleashed a flurry of new services, not all of which will be exclusive to Apple users. Apart from a few upgrades to the iPad Air and iPad Mini, the company placed minimal importance on hardware.Apple's line up of services included a TV programming service, credit card, magazine subscription and game subscription service. Another unusual fact about the event was that most of the announcement Apple made wasn’t ready for launch. The tech giant also steered clear of pricing of most of their new services.Most of Apple’s services aren’t ground-breaking feats of innovation; they simply improve on current software-driven services that are available today. But, why the shift in focus?iPhones accounted for a significant chunk – well-over 50-per cent – of Apple’s business ever since their inception in 2007. However, iPhones have lately become a mainly expensive affair with prices in the US soaring above $1000, and that’s considering prices aren’t inflated in US markets. In markets like India, the budget iPhone XR (US Price – $700) launched at Rs 76,900 (Roughly $1,115). That’s a lot for a smartphone. Apple’s increase in profits has primarily been in part due to its expensive smartphones rather than increasing popularity.Another reason is technology. Smartphone technology has just about reached its peak, and any current innovation in smartphone technology only serves as an update from the previous generation, rather than an entirely new concept. New features like gesture control, vibrating screens and cinema-wide aspect ratios don’t particularly influence average consumers. In fact, flagships usually tend to offer great performance for three to four years.But while Apple smartphone sales numbers haven’t been particularly good, the company is making excellent strides in its services area. Apple’s services are their second highest revenue source after smartphones. So, rather than bank on expensive hardware, Apple has strategically doubled-down on its subscription services.None"

For example, younger children learn through simple crafts material by creating structures, learning addition, multiplication and subtraction. For some children, we have created digital tools and kits that consist of sensors and circuits, which they are taught to connect and generate sound, light or get a small fan to run.”While Prasad was imparting special lessons at these schools, she observed that very few girl students took part in the activities. That’s when ‘Indian Girls Code’ was born. The first programme was held in a Trichy orphanage, where 75 girls are taught robotics and coding for free."

title,Viewpoint | Want to invest in debt market? Know how secure are 'Secured Bonds'
datetime,2019-03-28 09:06:00+00:00
description,"The basic tenet remained that if you are a small borrower and you cannot repay you are in trouble and if you are a large borrower and you cannot repay, the bank is in trouble."
content,"Joydeep SenIt would sound simplistic to say that bonds are of two types, secured and unsecured. But that is what we read in our college textbooks. At that time, we were too young to understand the real import of the term ‘secured’ bonds.We were told that secured means the bonds are secured by charge against assets of the company, which could be land or building or machinery or receivables. We were given to understand by our professors that if a company defaults, the security i.e. the charged assets can be sold off and the money realised.As we grew up, we realised that is not how it works. If a company defaults, or is not in good shape, the bank would rather not realise the assets but ‘evergreen’ the loan. Even if the lender intends to sell the charged assets, it is not the bank’s discretion but it has to go through the court of law. Once a case goes to the court of law, how much time it takes to settle, years or decades, is anybody’s guess.The first ray of light came in the form of The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (also known as the SARFAESI Act). We were told, by the provisions of the Act, that it allows banks and other financial institutions to auction residential or commercial properties (of the defaulter) to recover loans.NoneTill the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the Act, it was not clear how this law can be applied. Even thereafter, there was not much change on the ground. The basic tenet remained that if you are a small borrower and you cannot repay, you are in trouble and if you are a large borrower and you cannot repay, the bank is in trouble.NoneThe February 12, 2018 Circular from the RBI stating all the ‘band aid’ schemes till that date were no longer applicable and defaulters have to be dealt under IBC only, put the final seal on this ‘swatchh Bharat abhiyaan’. Now what is the relevance of all this discussion?The relevance is, recently, there were issues with a few cash-challenged corporates, in Loan-Against-Securities (LAS) deals, where the promoters did not put up additional collateral shares/pay up cash when the equity shares price crashed and coverage dipped below the stipulated minimum. These deals are also known as ‘promoter funding’ as promoter’s shares are pledged for the deal.For non-bank institutions who cannot give one-on-one loans to strike such deals, there is a bond issued by a company in the group, typically an obscure company, and the security for the bond is promoter’s shares pledged with the lender. To be noted, in case of default, shares can be sold by the lender, without the intervention of the court of law as in case of ‘secured’ bonds with charge against physical assets.These LAS deals, post non-top-up, are being given a shady description and there is a perception that bonds secured by equity shares are effectively unsecured. Let’s pause a moment and think, what’s the security in a ‘secured bond’?The charge against physical assets is typically 1 to 1.25 times of the value of the bond, though it may be a higher coverage. The audit on whether it is being maintained at the stipulated coverage is done once a year and there too I am not sure whether it is monitored religiously.The point is, the security coverage or lack of it is not as optically visible and we tend to believe it is secured. Basically it is lack of information. In a LAS deal, if the stipulated coverage is 2 times, there is a share price discovery every day and the extent of security coverage can be monitored by the lender every day.To conclude, it is not so much about the security collateral. It is about whether the borrowing corporate pays the interest on due dates and principal on maturity. That in turn depends on whether the corporate has the money to pay and the intention to pay. Ownership stocks are closer to the heart of the promoter and binds them better than losing some physical assets. When it comes to crunch, IBC is the coup de grace."

description,"Unless Priyanka Gandhi’s Ayodhya visit includes a peep-in at the makeshift Ram temple, and a clear statement of Congress’ intent, it will not help the Congress in attracting either Hindus or Muslims to its fold."
content,"Valay Singh Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to Ayodhya marks the third time a Gandhi has come to Ayodhya just before Lok Sabha elections. Nearly three decades ago, in 1989, her father Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, visited the town to seek votes in the name of Ayodhya and Ram.However, the family’s association with the temple town goes back to at least seven decades. In 1949, on the intervening night of December 22-23, a group of local Hindus forcibly placed Ram Lalla idols inside Babri masjid. The horrific violence of Partition was just abating and worried about another outbreak of communal violence, Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister, repeatedly urged then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Gobind Vallabh Pant to remove the idols and restore the mosque to its original state prior to December 23. Nehru even offered to visit Ayodhya to resolve the dispute. However, Pant had prevailed with his view that the mosque should be declared disputed and its control transferred to a government receiver. The legal case that began then remains pending even today.After Nehru’s death in 1964, the Congress split into factions made up of Nehru’s peers called the Syndicate and those who rallied around Indira Gandhi. Ahead of the 1967 Lok Sabha elections, which was also her first, she visited Faizabad and Ayodhya to campaign for her faction’s candidate Vishwanath Kapoor. Indira Gandhi herself had chosen to contest from neighbouring Raebareli, her late husband Feroze Gandhi’s constituency. Both Kapoor and Gandhi won their respective seats.By the time of Indira Gandhi’s killing in October 1984, politics in north India had started changing considerably. Resentment against the Congress was rising and new forces such as the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) and caste-based parties were emerging.Her unexpected death generated a huge sympathy wave and gave her son and successor Rajiv Gandhi, one of the largest victories in Indian electoral history. However Rajiv, a political novice, soon found himself hemmed in by Hindu and Muslim fanatics.In 1986, acquiescing to both, he first overturned the Shah Bano verdict by an Act of Parliament, and then as a counter, oversaw the opening of the locks of Babri masjid as well as a brick-laying ceremony outside the disputed mosque. By then, Ayodhya had become a launch pad of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s plan to create a unified Hindu vote-bank.Finally, in 1989, in a bid to appease the majority Hindus, Rajiv launched the Lok Sabha election campaign from Ayodhya and promised ‘Ram Rajya’ if he won. The Congress lost more than half of the seats it had won in 1984, while the BJP exploded on the political stage with its tally going up to 89 MPs from just two.NoneNoneIn the past five years, Congress has changed tactics to shed the image of being a party inimical to Hindus. In elections since 2014, Rahul has donned the sacred thread (janeu), appeared in posters as Ram himself and made a point to publicise his visits to temples. This new avatar has been criticised by both the Left parties and the BJP, calling it capitulation to the Right-wing and Congress’ soft Hindutva strategy to fool Hindus respectively.That said, the Congress, always in a Catch-22 situation as far as the Ram temple is concerned, has remained non-committal, and has argued that the issue be decided by courts after the Lok Sabha elections.Unless Priyanka Gandhi’s Ayodhya visit includes a peep-in at the makeshift Ram temple at the disputed site, and a clear statement of Congress’ intent, it is likely to remain a predictable and tepid photo-op, one which will not help the Congress in attracting either Hindus or Muslims to its fold.Valay Singh is a Delhi-based journalist and author of Ayodhya: City of Faith, City of Discord.

content,"NoneThe board of MSIL, which agreed to hand over a third term to Ayukawa, 64, on March 27 reposed faith in the sales and marketing veteran as Maruti Suzuki prepares to face its toughest challenge in decades.Tepid demand, rising costs, additional competition from new companies, stringent regulatory challenges, technology sourcing and sharing with a new partner, planning long term production capacities and retention and expansion of retail network partners are some of the tasks for Ayukawa going ahead.The board's decision to retain Ayukawa also helps in charting a smoother road for switching over to Bharat Stage-VI and other regulations beyond 2020.Unlike other international automotive companies such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota, MSIL has had stable continuity at the top order, thereby helping it manage its goals better. Under Ayukawa, the market leader has only strengthened its position in the domestic market.When he took over in 2013 after the retirement of Shinzo Nakanishi, the company’s market share stood at 39 percent. Six years later, it had a share of 51 percent by close of February.It was also under Ayukawa that MSIL became aggressive in the premium car segment, selling them under a very different looking retail format called Nexa. While the debut with S-Cross did not meet expectations and they were forced to sell them at discounts, subsequent models such as Baleno and Ignis turned the tide for MSIL. Baleno is now the fourth highest-selling model in the country with average monthly sales of 18,000 units.Aided by his senior RC Bhargava, who is the non-executive Chairman, Ayukawa's Maruti Suzuki comfortably sailed past the minimum voting level mark when minority shareholders voted on Maruti’s most controversial decision in its history. Proxy advisory firms and analysts became skeptical of parent Suzuki's plan of manufacturing cars in India and asking MSIL to sell them, thus reducing the latter's stature to just a sales company.Maruti was able to avoid bearing huge investments for setting up car making factories while instead using the same in buying real estate. Maruti's management believed that in the long run should the car sales business be generating lesser profits than today, then less number of dealers will join the business.Thus, MSIL decided to buy land and real estate (the most costliest component in car retailing activity) and it can give out the space for running Maruti showrooms on rent to dealers. Little surprise that the decision came when the sales veteran Ayukawa was at the helm of the company.But Ayukawa does not deny the current situation. The passenger vehicle (PV) market is at its slowest in four years as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. New PV sales grew by just three percent as against the expected 8-10 percent. More buyers are interested in discounts than the product package.None"

The Shia leader had then secured 16,000 votes out of the 3.12 lakh votes polled.The Congress had not fielded a candidate against Abdullah in the 2017 byelection to Srinagar Lok Sabha seat necessitated by Karra's resignation from Lok Sabha and the PDP in 2016 over the handling of the situation in Kashmir by the PDP-BJP coalition government.People's Conference led by Sajad Gani Lone is trying to project itself as an alternative to the NC and the PDP in regional politics. The party, which moved out of the separatist camp in 2009 to return to electoral politics, won the Mayoral elections to Srinagar Municipal Corporation.People's Conference has fielded businessman Irfan Ansari, another newbie in electoral politics, against Abdullah.Ansari, however, has his elder brother -- Shia leader and former minister Imran Ansari -- to guide him through. The businessman is confident that he would be able to connect better with the youth.""I represent the younger generation and I believe I am more in touch with the problems and realities faced by today's generation and would be able take on the challenges confronting this generation. I will not only be able to understand them well but also try and find a way to resolve those problems,"" he said.Political observers feel that by fielding a ""weak"" candidate in Mohsin, the PDP might have conceded the Srinagar Lok Sabha seat to the National Conference president. The other notable candidate in the fray is BJP spokesman Khalid Jehangir, who has never contested elections before.His only claim to prominence was his stint as vice chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Project Construction Corporation, a state PSU, during the PDP-BJP coalition government in the state.While Mohsin will be banking on significant Shia votes and support base of the PDP for staging an upset, for BJP's Jehangir, it will be a tough initiation into electoral politics of Kashmir which has been dominated by the National Conference for many decades.PDP spokesman Harbaksh Singh said it would be wrong to write off Mohsin in the electoral battle. ""He had contested 2014 Lok Sabha polls and taken significant number of votes. He is a prominent Shia leader and scholar. Moreover, he has the backing of the biggest political party of the state,"" Singh said.Farooq Abdullah has lost an election only once in his 42-year political career since his debut in electoral politics in 1980.The three-time former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir was first elected as member of Lok Sabha in 1980. However, Abdullah returned to state politics in the wake of failing health of his father and National Conference leader Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah in 1981.He succeeded as chief minister of the state in September 1982 following his father's death. Farooq Abdullah stayed in state politics till 2002 when he handed over the presidency of National Conference to his son, Omar Abdullah, hoping that he would succeed him as chief minister as well.However, Omar Abdullah's loss in the 2002 assembly election put paid such hopes as the National Conference decided to sit in the opposition, despite emerging as the single largest party.Farooq Abdullah stayed away from active politics for several years but made a comeback by first winning Rajya Sabha elections in early 2009 and then entering Lok Sabha for the second time in May 2009.His only election loss came in 2014 Lok Sabha elections.The notification for elections to Srinagar Lok Sabha seat was issued on March 20 while the polling will be held on April 18 in the second phase of polls.The Srinagar Lok Sabha seat is spread over three districts of Srinagar, Budgam and Ganderbal."

description,"Raghuram Rajan's new book, The Third Pillar, talks about why the economic system looks broken and how to fix it."
content,"The wave of populist nationalism sweeping countries globally can be traced to political worries arising out of challenges posed to economic progress by technology, says economist Raghuram Rajan.In an interview with Moneycontrol’s Gaurav Choudhury, Rajan said governments can cope with this by empowering local communities, which he dubs as ‘the third pillar’ in the economic system, after the state and markets.The former Reserve Bank of India governor, and professor at the Chicago Booth School, has released a book by the same name, in which he talks about the need for the three pillars to play an equally important role.“Even in India, over the decades, we have tried to empower local governments through systems such as the Panchayati Raj [but it is not enough],” he said. “Even municipalities are not empowered [to the extent they should be].”In his book, the outspoken Rajan, whose term as RBI governor ended in 2016 after the Narendra Modi government did not offer him an extension, does not shy away from warning about the dangers of rising populist nationalism.In particular, he termed the RSS, the ideological parent of the ruling BJP, as a “serious threat to a liberal, tolerant, innovative India”.“In a democracy, it is good to have all views,” Rajan explained in the interview. “But if there is an over-representation of one view, and if that view is intolerant of other views, that is a problem.”He also talked about the relationship between the Reserve Bank of India and the government, saying they tend to be ‘conflictual’ in nature, but the differences between the two should be constructive and not destructive.Rajan’s successor at the RBI, Urjit Patel, resigned midway through his tenure amid concerns that the government was meddling excessively with the central bank’s decisions.In his book, the economist has written at length about the idea of ‘universal basic income’. When asked about the Congress’ ‘minimum income guarantee’ promise for the poor, Rajan said the idea would work if such a scheme is effectively targeted, and is fiscally prudent – that is, other welfare schemes, which are less effective, are rolled back and overall spending is contained.Rajan echoed concerns raised by other economists on the quality of economic data in India, saying that the lack of jobs data and the perceived unreliability of the GDP data could pose challenges to policymakers and undermine investor confidence.“We need better data and better confidence in data,” he said. “You can’t operate such a large economy on the basis of data, which nobody knows is correct or not.”"

datetime,2019-03-28 21:40:00+00:00
description,Kharge has never been defeated and has held a number of ministerial posts in both Karnataka and the central government
content,"Apart from being the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha, and the Congress' voice on many issues in the Lower House, Mallikarjun Kharge has also been the party's man Friday for several years.A trusted lieutenant of the party and, particularly, the Gandhi family, Kharge has been at the centre of a number of messy situations, including in Mumbai, where Congress has often been divided and subject to infighting. Kharge has been called in to resolve the situation a number of times.According to Congress leaders in the state, Kharge has the ability to juggle between several veterans in Maharashtra, including state Congress chief Ashok Chavan and former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan. It is the ego tussle between senior leaders that has troubled the state's Congress for long, and Kharge has the ear of each one of them. That is also probably the reason why he was appointed as the Maharashtra state in-charge for the party in 2018.However, Maharashtra is not the only state where Kharge has proved his mettle as a deft negotiator who listens to local leaders and bridges the gap between them and the high command. Recently, in Karnataka, after the announcement of the seat-sharing pact between the Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress, many party leaders were reportedly unhappy with the high command's decision to hand over Mandya and Tumkur seats to the JD(S). Kharge, according to reports, had been the man who again bridged the gap between the party's central leadership and the state-level leaders, negotiating on behalf of both to come to a conclusion acceptable to all.The 75-year-old, who hails from Karnataka, was being considered a CM probable during the Karnataka Assembly polls in 2017, with reports suggesting that his background as a Dalit leader and his seniority worked in his favor. Kharge, however, had said he would much rather be the CM because of his seniority than his caste, a comment that had drawn appreciation.Appreciation and a taunt also came from Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, who, during a speech in Lok Sabha, said while Kharge is a ""decent"" and ""simple"" human being, he keeps on ""dissent""-ing. Kharge and Modi have been associated otherwise, as well, in that both served on the selection panel, comprising the PM, Kharge and Justice AK Sikri, that sacked former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chief Alok Verma. Kharge had voted against the sacking, the rest voted for.Born in 1942, Kharge's career started off as a student union leader and then as a labour organiser in Karnataka. He joined the Congress in 1969, and gradually rose through the ranks of the party. Observers point out that rising in a Karnataka unit dominated by Vokkaligas and Lingayat was no mean feat, but Kharge had enough political acumen and ability to rise on to become the party's trusted man in both the national and the state capitals.Entering the assembly for the first time in 1972 from the Gurmitkal constituency, Kharge has never been defeated and has held a number of ministerial posts in the state government. He entered Parliament in 2009 after winning Gulbarga Lok Sabha constituency, a feat he repeated in 2014.While Kharge has helmed the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Labour and Employment before, he missed out on a CM post for his home state three times: once, in 1999 to SM Krishna, then in 2004 to N Dharam Singh and finally in 2017, to HD Kumaraswamy. According to reports, Kharge extended support to all of them, but has largely remained out of the recent Karnataka coalition politics.The Congress veteran has also been embroiled in controversy in his home state recently and has been accused of playing ""divisive politics"" to build a career for his son Priyank. A number of senior Congress leaders and legislators from Karnataka have recently resigned from the party, all citing Kharge and his politics as the reason. The latest to resign was A B Maalakaraddi, and before him went former ministers Malikayya Guttedar, Baburao Chinchansur and Vaijanth Patil, all joining the BJP."

A four nights trip to Cochin from Mumbai will cost Rs 25,000.The costs include accommodation, dining at select restaurants, entry into the theatre, casino and discothèque to name a few. Indian nationals don’t need a visa to travel to Maldives as there is the facility of visa-on-arrival.Mumbai Port Trust has earmarked Rs 300 crore for developing a new international cruise terminal in the financial capital. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had laid the foundation stone in January last year.Effort are under way by the central government to expand the capacity of the terminal to 5000 passengers and the vessel handling capacity to 160. The expansion work will be complete by end of 2019. During 2018, a Mumbai-Goa cruise liner 'Angriya' was flagged off from Mumbai, making it the only ship to connect the two states via the waterway.Already two cruise companies that connected Mumbai have shut down in the last 3-5 years as per Gupta. But the tide is turning.Though Mumbai gets its share of cruise ships which connects it with international destinations such as Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malayasia and the Middle East, the traffic of cruise ship in the coming sailing seasons is expected to grow multi-fold.As data shared by the Mumbai Port Trust during September 2018 and May 2019, around 61 cruise ships are expected to berth at Mumbai. In the next season, which kicks off in September 1 and will last till May 31, 2019, 161 ships are expected to berth in the city."

content,"For decades, Indian IT’s business model was simple. Hire in bulk, get employees to work on routine client solutions, bill in US dollars, pay in Indian rupees, pocket the (handsome) difference.That, however, changed when the digital revolution started a few years ago.Digital is an encompassing term for technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence, big data, analytics, cloud computing and machine learning, all of which are used by businesses in an increasingly connected world.The advancement in technologies forced Indian companies to tweak their business models, as their traditional outsourcing business models came under pressure.NoneThis it has done by hiring talent that has skills suited to digital, and by training its existing workforce to climb up the value chain.“There are two types of hiring happening now in the IT sector,” said Kris Lakshmikanth, founder and CEO, Headhunters India, a talent acquisition firm. “Companies hire engineers from campus [for the routine business] and hold online tests when they want to hire niche talents.”While campus hiring constitutes about 70 percent of total hiring, about 30 percent of new hires are made with an eye on new technologies.In 2017, the company introduced the Infosys Learning Platform for training existing employees and new hires on latest technologies.Infosys is also looking to hire non-engineers such as people in liberal arts or with design skills – about as many as 20-30 percent of the company’s US hires were from such background.The focus on digital has paid off by way of revenues. The segment contributes about 31 percent to the company’s revenues.Infosys’ focus on digital can also be gauged from a reading of its annual reports from 2013 to 2018 – the mention of the word ‘digital’ has gone up from 30 to 134.The company’s CEO, Salil Parekh, in a recent interaction emphasised the growing importance of digital, saying that the company plans to ramp up its digital capabilities both organically and inorganically."

description,LG G8 ThinQ's $820 price makes it a direct Galaxy S10 competitor. 
content,"The Samsung Galaxy S10 and LG G8 ThinQ are built to provide users with the pen-ultimate smartphone experience. Both phones are equipped with top-of-the-line hardware and feature several improvements from their last generation counterparts.With the US launch price of the LG G8 ThinQ announced at approximately USD 820 (Approx. – Rs 57,000), it doesn’t come anywhere close to the S10 Plus, which retails at a USD 1,000 (Price in India – Rs 73,900). But comparing the Galaxy S10 which is equally priced at USD 800 might just make for an excellent flagship battle.PerformanceNoneWhen it comes to performance, both the G8 and S10 set the bar quite high. The G8 ThinQ runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, while Samsung’s Exynos 9820 chipset powers the S10. The Snapdragon 855 chipset on the G8 ThinQ however does hold the upper hand against the Exynos 9820 on the S10 .Design and DisplayNoneThe display on both the S10 and G8 are similarly sized. Both phones also feature OLED panels with Quad HD+ resolution, but unlike the G8 which only features HDR10, the Galaxy S10 comes with HDR10+. But that isn’t just about it; the Galaxy S10 also features an Infinity-O display that hides the front camera in a hole on the screen. When it comes to design, the Galaxy S10 features a completely refreshed design, while the LG G8 looks more like a polished G7 with its large notch.CameraNoneWhile LG does deserve some points for its strong dual-front camera setup, especially considering the second time of flight (ToF) camera will provide excellent depth and improve AR experiences on the phone. However, the Galaxy S10’s rear camera setup is the same as the Galaxy S10 Plus, which has already earned a 109 score on DxOMark, making it the second-best camera in the world. This is not to say that LG’s G8 features a poor camera setup, it’s just that the Galaxy S10 is far better at this point, at least in terms of photography.New FeaturesNoneThe Galaxy S10 brings an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor and reverse wireless charging to the table, while LG’s standout features include gesture control, a display that toggles as an earpiece speaker and vein unlock, which lets you unlock your phone with your phone. Of the two, LG’s features seem more innovative.Verdict"

content,"Asking the people of Telangana to vote for a ""new Bharat"" where the people of the state will also benefit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the citizens in the country were moving forward sans any fear as the 'chowkidar' has been 'alert.'Addressing a mammoth public rally here, Modi took a swipe at Chief Minister K Chandrasekar Rao for the delay in forming the cabinet after securing a massive win last year, saying the latter must have been influenced by some astrologer.Rao is said to be a firm believer in rituals and astrology. The Prime Minister described Rao as the ""face"" of dynastic and appeasement politics. In his first rally here post the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls, Modi said despite abuses and attacks against him, he has steadfastly moved ahead with his development agenda due to the 'blessings' of the people.""Your blessings allowed me to tolerate all kinds of pressures. That's why I could run a decision-making government,"" he said. He assserted the NDA government during the last five has left no stone unturned to ensure women's safety and farmers' security, among other things.The Prime Minister said he was working hard in areas ranging from civic amenities to space, an obvious reference to the country successfully experimenting 'Mission Shakti,' after an 'Anti-Sat' (A-Sat) missile had shot down a low earth orbit satellite, putting the country into an elite club."

title,Indian banks are riding the Blockchain wave
datetime,2019-03-29 20:32:00+00:00
description,Blockchain technology has the potential to change the way financial service transactions are carried out. 
content,"Blockchain technology, also known as the decentralised, distributed ledger technology, has gained visibility in India in the last two years. According to a report, in the next five years, Blockchain has a potential to create value to the tune of USD 5 billion in India across all sectors.Many banks in India are increasingly investing in the technology. Leveraging the distributed ledger technology, a consortium of India’s eleven largest banks including ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, RBL Bank, South Indian Bank, and Axis Bank have launched the first ever blockchain-linked loan system in the country. This not only ensures transparency in credit disbursement, it also removes any communication hurdle among the different banks.Federal Bank recently launched its Blockchain based remittance solution for NRIs.Blockchain solutions are expected to bring operational efficiency, simplicity and transparency in banking operations. It also enhances banking experiences for customers by reducing transaction time from hours to seconds.“Blockchain technology also eliminates manual processes and friction in day-to-day trade finance, digital identities and cross-border payments. Banks are using Blockchain to rewire financial markets for optimized cash management and consumer lending while transforming online and international payments processes,” says Jitan Chandanani, Blockchain Offerings & Engagement Leader, IBM India/ South Asia.“With Blockchain, one can conduct business quickly and securely, moving from paper-based to Blockchain stored transaction records, which can enable expansion to underserved markets such as small and medium enterprises,” he adds.Promoting Trust and transparencyBlockchain technology has the potential to change the way financial service transactions are carried out. Insurance, Trade Finance, Cross Border Payments, Digital Identities have witnessed an increased adoption which will further facilitate the development of a more strategic BFSI industry. Its distributed ledger technology, smart contracts, security, built-in governance and control capabilities give institutions real-time access to trade finance data and information. This helps mitigate risk, eliminate wait time and increase transparency.“Banks spend a lot of time and effort identifying and validating records multiple times for the same customers. Requiring customers to provide identifying information repeatedly can erode customer satisfaction and cause transactional delays. In short, banks are using blockchain to promote trust and transparency, eliminate fraud and respond to the changing needs of the market,” explains Chandanani.Blockchain is expected to have a direct impact on reducing operational costs and improving efficiencies. Although the technology is still in its nascent stages of commercial deployment, there is a need to form policies and procedures to ensure that personally identifiable information is always protected.With the technology still evolving, clearing the misconceptions created by bitcoins are among the main challenges faced by the industry in adoption of Blockchain solutions. “These are early days with Blockchain technology, and the challenges persist with multiple Blockchain fabrics like Hyperleger, Ethereum, etc. There are trust issues since a member doesn't want to part with their proprietary data.“In a decentralized ecosystem like Blockchain, it's about how multiple participants can view each other. Even competitors have to become collaborators. There is still time before people start making use of the transformative potential of Blockchain. At the same time, the questions around regulations will have to be resolved through focused discussions with competent regulatory authorities and incorporation of their thought-process. Surely, an effective implementation roadmap can mitigate or address most of these challenges."

title,Here's how one company is helping small banks to ensure Digital Payment interoperability
datetime,2019-03-29 20:29:00+00:00
description,"While the rest of India’s banking sector is seeing rapid digitization, the rural banks that cannot afford RTGS or joining NFS, are at a disadvantage. Now, an indigenous solution seems to be at hand."
content,"Historically, rural India used to suffer from a severe deficiency in power and connectivity infrastructure, shortage of skilled workforce and paucity of funds for investment in technology.Mass electrification initiatives and availability of leased lines in the rural landscape definitely brought out some changes and small banks were able to implement core banking systems and deploy ATMs for the exclusive use of their customers.Yet, despite this modernization, small banks continued to operate in proprietary silos, completely excluded from participating in the national financial ecosystem.This is primarily because small banks could not become direct members of the National Financial Switch (NFS) as they were not members of RTGS and could not afford to become one.In order to connect with NFS, small banks needed to invest heavily in their own Data Centre equipped with their own Electronic Fund transfer (EFT) switches in a secure PCI-DSS environment and hire highly trained personnel to manage the entire infrastructure. This prohibitive capex meant that small banks were not interoperable, and their customers remained largely under-banked.But one company is bringing about significant change in this space. Pune-based Sarvatra Technologies, founded in 2000, has been playing a vital role in digitizing small co-operative and rural banks across the country.“Our Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering provides infrastructure on a shared basis to these small banks, operating on a pay-per-use basis. Possessing own Data Centre and payments infrastructure was difficult for banks due to the huge capex involved in owning and managing the required infrastructure. We provided the entire infrastructure, required for a bank to centralize its system and to participate in the national payment network, as a managed service,” says Mandar Agashe, Founder and Vice Chairman of the company.Interoperability was another key challenge for co-operative banks in the country as mon-members of NFS were not interoperable with other banks.In 2010, NPCI allowed Sarvatra EFT Switch to be the first EFT switch by an ASP (Application Service Provider) to connect directly to NFS.“This homegrown RuPay network, in our opinion, is the single most impactful technological development that has enabled even the smallest of banks to participate in the national financial ecosystem, thereby contributing hugely towards achieving the financial inclusion goals of India. In fact, Sarvatra has the honour of being the first ASP in India to connect directly to NFS and to get a sub-member bank live on RuPay Debit platform,” adds Agashe.The company has been able to on-board 500+ co-operative banks on to the digital platform through NFS till date. “They (Sarvatra) are bringing sub-member banks on other NPCI platforms like IMPS, UPI, AePS and Bharat BillPay. The company not only on boards Urban Cooperative banks but also State Co-operative Banks and District Central Cooperative Banks which is helping in financial inclusion,” quotes NPCI’s website."

title,Dynasty Watch | The Chautalas of Haryana battle infighting and hurt egos going into LS polls
datetime,2019-03-29 15:45:00+00:00
description,"In November last year, the simmering feud within the party came out in the open"
content,"NoneThis isn't the first time, however, that a family feud has broken out within the Chautalas, arguably the most prominent family in Haryana politics.Om Prakash's ascent to power Devi Lal, the former Deputy Prime Minister of India, was the founder and patriarch of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), the party of the Chautalas. While the party name kept on changing until 1987, when INLD was fixed, Devi Lal remained the unquestioned leader and a Jat patriarch in Haryana.Devi Lal was involved in the Quit India movement, and post-Independence, in organising farmers' agitation in the state. He also reportedly played an active role in the formation of Haryana state.In 1988, a feud broke out between Devi Lal's sons, Om Prakash Chautala and Ranjit Singh. Singh was a minister in the state cabinet, being headed by Devi Lal, who was the Chief Minister then. Om Prakash was the chief of INLD.The spark for the battle was when a bureaucrat in the state government accused the then home minister of Haryana, Sampath Singh, of corruption. The bureaucrat was close to Ranjit, while Sampath was close to Om Prakash.NoneThe allegations triggered alarm bells for Om Prakash, who figured that it was an attempt to weaken his position in the battle for succession of the Chautala legacy. A tug-of-war emerged, which led to Om Prakash being given the CM's post after Devi Lal assumed position as Deputy PM.Ranjit Singh eventually left the party and the clan to join Congress, and is reportedly close to former Haryana CM and Congress veteran Bhupinder Singh Hooda.Om Prakash went on to repeat his term as the CM of Haryana, and is now serving a 10-year jail term along with one of his sons, Ajay Chautala, for involvement in the JBT teacher recruitment scam.History repeats itselfThe fact that Ajay is in jail along with Om Prakash, according to observers, provided Abhay, the younger son, the chance to plunge into politics.This was reportedly unacceptable to Ajay, who wanted his son Dushyant Chautala to be the face of INLD, and thus the party's CM candidate for Haryana assembly elections, scheduled for later this year. Dushyant is the youngest Member of Parliament (MP) in the history of Lok Sabha, having been elected from Hisar in 2014 at 26.Ajay reportedly feared that with Abhay at the helm, the latter would look after his own son, Karan Chautala, gearing up for his political plunge in the coming elections instead of the nephews.NoneIn November last year, the simmering feud within the party came out in the open. In a statement, Om Prakash stated that he had expelled Dushyant and his brother Digvijay from the party on charges of indiscipline and hooliganism. This was followed by Ajay, their father, being expelled for ""anti-party"" activities.Ajay had likened the feud within his party with the Mahabharata, and had toured the entire state while on two-week parole to drum up support for his sons before he was expelled.NoneKey figures of Chautala clan:NoneNoneNoneNone"

description,"""Do we know which part of India he (Modi) is being sought in,"" the judge asked, to try and establish which jail Modi is likely to be held in."
content,"There was some light-hearted moments during the second bail plea hearing of Nirav Modi at the UK court when Judge Emma Arbuthnot asked the prosecution whether the fugitive diamond trader would be lodged in the same jail cell along with liquor baron Vijay Mallya if he is also extradited to India.At the very start of the hearing on March 29, Westminster Magistrates Court Chief Magistrate Arbuthnot said she was getting a sense of ""deja vu"", in reference to her having ordered the extradition of Mallya in December last year.""Do we know which part of India he (Modi) is being sought in,"" the judge asked, to try and establish which jail Modi is likely to be held in.She was told by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian government, that it would be an extradition to Mumbai and that he may in fact be held in the same Arthur Road Jail as that prepared for liquor tycoon Mallya, to which the judge said in a light-hearted vein that it could even be the same cell as we know ""there is space"" from the previous video submitted during the Mallya extradition trial.India has informed the UK court that Mallya will be lodged in one of the high security barracks located in a two-storey building inside the Arthur Road prison complex in Mumbai.Authorities at the Arthur Road prison in Mumbai have kept a high security cell ready for Mallya if he is extradited from UK in connection with loan default cases against him in India.India has sought the extradition of Modi, 48, for alleged ""high value and sophisticated"" fraud and money laundering amounting to USD 2 billion.Mallya, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to around Rs 9,000 crore, has filed his application in the UK High Court, seeking permission to appeal against an extradition order signed by the British Home Secretary.If extradited, 62-year-old Mallya will be lodged in the prison complex, which also housed 26/11 Mumbai attack terrorist Mohammad Ajmal Kasab. An official from the Ministry of Home Affairs earlier said Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail was one of the best in the country. His comments came after Judge Arbuthnot asked Indian authorities to submit a video of the Arthur Road Jail cell where they plan to keep Mallya following his extradition.The official said adequate medical facilities were available to treat prisoners in Arthur Road Jail, where Mallya would get full security cover as an undertrial prisoner and it was highly secured in accordance with international standards.The central government has already conducted an assessment of security cover given to prisoners in the Arthur Road Jail and its findings conveyed to the UK court. In another throwback to the Mallya trial, Modi's defence team, led by barrister Clare Montgomery raised the issue of the state of the paperwork submitted by the Indian authorities, claiming it ""made her cry"" at one stage."

title,Use Market Breadth Thrust to create an excellent judge of market momentum

description,Breadth thrust is an internal indicator and it is a ratio of moving averages that creates an excellent judge of market momentum.
content,"Chandan TapariaIn this session of technical analysis, we will discuss Market Breadth Indicators.Breadth thrust is an internal indicator and it is a ratio of moving averages that creates an excellent judge of market momentum. The breadth thrust indicator creates a percentage value that moves just like a traditional oscillator from 1 to 100.It can be read just like a stochastic or RSI, where overbought and oversold levels are at the extremes. Divergence with the underlying price chart points to weakening momentum. The number of days to set for the moving averages should be determined by the time-period being evaluated.ARMS IndexIt is developed by Richard Arms, TRIN is a double-ratio that divides the A/D ratio by the A/D volume ratio. The formula for TRIN = (# of Advancing Stocks / # of Declining Stocks) / (Volume of Advancing Stocks / Volume of Declining Stocks). A value of less than 1 means advancing stocks are getting more than their share of volume, which is bullish for the market.When the value of TRIN is more than 1, declining shares are taking an outsized amount of volume, which is bearish for the market. TRIN is usually smoothed using a moving average, which should be tuned to the time-period being evaluated. Trend lines drawn from the moving average reveal the direction of market momentum.McClellan OscillatorMcClellan oscillator is another internal indicator. The formula for McClellan Oscillator = [19-Day Exp. Moving Average of (# of Advancing Stocks -# of Declining Stocks)] / [ 39-Day Exp. Moving Average of (# of Advancing Stocks -# of Declining Stocks)].This formula creates a ratio comparing the 19-day and 39-day EMA of the A/D spread. The chart is an oscillator that ranges from +100 to –100 with overbought and oversold levels usually found at +70 and –70, respectively.The McClellan Oscillator can be read just like any other oscillator and is usually not smoothed, but it can be charted with a moving average as an indicator line.(The author is Associate Vice President - Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited)"

Warner remained unbeaten on 100 as the Sunrisers finished with an imposing total of 231/2.Turning point    A brilliant opening spell from Mohammed Nabi completely turned the game in Hyderabad’s favour.

So, how does V15 Pro stack up against the competition? Let’s check out.DesignIf V15 Pro's design could be described in one word, it would be: stunning. The smartphone sports a beautiful gradient colour design at the back. Though the back is made of plastic, the smooth glossy finish gives the phone a glass-back look, making it feel super-premium to hold.The Topaz Blue model we reviewed changed shades when held at different angles of light. To say the least, V15 Pro is one of the best-looking smartphones in its range.As far as physical aspects are concerned, the device houses a volume rocker and power on/off button on the right side, a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top, and a Google Assistant button and dedicated microSD card slot on the left.The SIM tray is placed at the bottom of the phone right next to the micro-USB port and the volume grill. Users can also use the Google Assistant button to assign the phone tasks such as taking a screenshot, or open the Google homepage.DisplayV15 Pro sports an impressive 6.3-inch display all-screen AMOLED display with no notch or a camera punch-hole of any kind. The screen turned out bright with punchy colours, which made watching movies or browsing a great experience.The display also houses an in-display fingerprint sensor incorporated underneath. The sensor turned out to be accurate and snappy every time we tried to unlock the device.PerformanceV15 Pro is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor which is built on 11nm processor technology. The smartphone is the first in India which runs on SD 675 SoC. The processor backed by 6GB RAM performs almost every operation thrown at it with ease.The phone tackled CPU/GPU-intensive operations -- playing games such as Asphalt 9 and Sniper 3D -- with ease. However, for some games, such as PUBG, you will have to play at lower settings to avoid experiencing lags.The phone runs on Vivo’s Funtouch OS 9 based on Android 9 out of the box. However, the UI shares more similarities with Apple’s iOS than Android. For example, the app drawer slides in from the bottom rather than the top as is usual for Android phones. Users who had previously used Android smartphones from other brands may need some time to get used to.However, it is worth mentioning that the UI is friendly and easy to use. On the flip side, Funtouch OS comes with a large number of bloatware. The saving grace: these can be deleted if not needed.CameraThe camera is the phone's selling point. V15 Pro sports a triple rear-camera setup with a 48MP primary camera, 8MP ultrawide camera along with a 5MP depth-sensor lens. At the front, the device sports a 32 MP camera placed in a motorised shell, which pops up whenever in use.Pictures clicked by the primary camera came out strikingly crisp not only in well-lit conditions but also in extremely low-light situations. In fact, the Night Mode on V15 Pro is one of the best we have tested yet, with the rear camera triplets capturing images with stellar details.The camera also performed spectacularly well when it came to portrait photos. It was able to focus on the subject with surprising level of accuracy while blurring out the background. Apart from standard mode, the rear camera also allows users to capture wide-angle shots with a 120-degree field-of-view.The rear camera can shoot 4K videos at 30fps without image stabilisation. However, if you drop the quality a notch to 1080p, the EIS comes in play, allowing users to shoot super stable videos.Coming to the front camera, the 32MP selfie camera pops up the moment we tapped the front camera icon. The 32MP snapper can click selfies with an amazing level of detail. Again, the front camera was stellar as far as Bokeh Mode is concerned with the camera offering multiple portrait lighting effects. As far as video shooting is concerned, the selfie camera can shoot videos at full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.BatteryThe smartphone packs in a 3700 mAh Li-Ion battery, which supports Vivo’s Dual-Engine Fast Charging technology. It can charge the battery to nearly 74 percent in an hour.The V15 Pro's battery is extremely good, lasting through the day with ease on regular usage. When subjected to heavy usage such as prolonged gaming and streaming movies over Wi-Fi, the smartphone could eke out about 12-13 hours on a single charge.VerdictPriced at Rs 28,999, Vivo V5 Pro is one of the best-looking camera-focussed smartphones, not only in its own segment but also among devices priced in the super-premium range.Sure, the device comes with its own negatives, which include a not-so-great processor and the absence of a USB Type-C connector, but what Vivo’s V15 Pro promises is photography and boy, it delivers."

content,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, earlier this month, took a covert jibe at Congress President Rahul Gandhi with a reference to dyslexia and dyslexic children. In February, Gandhi had attacked the prime minister, wondering if latter was suffering from schizophrenia.Then, it was Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Karnataka parliamentarian Anant Kumar Hegde who reportedly called Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy schizophrenic. Schizophrenia is an extreme mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Dyslexia is a learning disorder.There is an unhindered flow of words and references to mental health while mocking political rivals.A senior journalist and a television anchor in Andhra Pradesh called evangelist politician KA Paul as having a bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is a manic-depressive illness. Paul's political outfit Praja Shanthi Party (PSP) is contesting the elections in the state.Dementia and Alzheimer's, often tied together with mental health, are also frequently used to describe opponents.Mental health stigmaThe 2019 Lok Sabha election has once again brought to the fore, the lack of awareness or sheer insensitivity towards mental health problems in our political discourse.The stigmatization of mental illness, becomes a major barrier for people with mental health problems to seek professional help, as they fear being labelled and bullied.Worse, many live in denial of the possibility of mental illness ever occurring to them.The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that around 20 percent of Indians may suffer from depression, of which according the National Mental Health Survey in India (2015-16), only about 10-12 percent get treated.WHO estimates that the burden of mental health problems is to the tune of 2,443 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1,00,000 population. The age-adjusted suicide rate per 1,00,000 population is 21.1.DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.It is estimated that in India, the economic loss from 2012 to 2030 due to mental health conditions would be 1.03 trillions of 2010 dollars."

All the good things that investors saw in the company during its IPO continue to be present -- the difference is that, at current levels, the stock provides a great entry opportunity.Amber is a contract manufacturer of room air conditioners (RACs). It is both an original design manufacturer (ODM) and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). It manufactures RACs and components thereof for eight out of the top 10 RAC brands (such as Daikin, LG, Panasonic etc) in India.The company also manufactures components for washing machines, refrigerators and television sets. Around 85 percent of its revenue are derived from ODM processes, which earn higher margin than OEM activities.NoneGoing forward, client stickiness, higher sale volumes, introduction of new products and favourable industry prospects should help Amber bolster its top-line. Also, increasing utilisation levels at manufacturing facilities, higher contribution from inverter RACs to overall revenue and benefits of backward integration (through inorganic growth strategies undertaken in the past) should augur well in terms of margins.NoneNoneThe company has been a trusted RAC manufacturer for eight of the top 10 AC brands in India. Since there is a high degree of technical expertise involved, Amber’s contracts with RAC brands are long-term in nature. This ensures client stickiness.To promote ‘Make in India’ initiatives, the government has imposed steep custom duties on imported RACs and its components. This should help Amber bag new contracts.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneBy virtue of these deals, the company aims to increase the contribution of AC components to its consolidated revenue, reduce dependence on RAC raw material suppliers, enter into new product categories and diversify its client exposure.NoneNoneNoneRisksOwing to stiff competition in the consumer durables business, RAC brands are forced to take price cuts in a bid to gain market share. This could put Amber's margin under pressure since its contracts are B2B (business-to-business) in nature. Weaker-than-expected summer conditions, as seen during the course of FY19, can impact revenue.OutlookLike all other cooling device manufacturers, Amber will end FY19 on a subdued note. This is predominantly because of a weak first quarter, usually the strongest quarter of the fiscal in terms of sales traction. Steep raw material costs, inventory build-up across trade channels and delayed winters in the fourth quarter also hurt the business.Nevertheless, tie-ups with marquee RAC brands, improving efficiency in operations, strong ODM capabilities and gradual regularisation of orders (mainly from southern and western India) should work in favour of Amber.The stock trades at 19.5 times its FY21 projected earnings.

title,Vishvesh Chauhan: A systems trader par excellence
datetime,2019-03-30 14:40:00+00:00
description,"Very rarely do we find a systems trader who is strong in technical analysis, data analytics and programming skills. Vishvesh Chauhan is one such trader"
content,"American historian Henry Brook Adams once said, ‘A teacher affects eternity’. Many success stories have an inspiring teacher that ignited a spark in a deserving student who then used it to achieve great heights.Today we cover one such bright young software engineer. Vishvesh Chauhan was inspired and encouraged by his teacher Avijan Dutta, who was a fund manager before he took to teaching, to look at markets as a career. Chauhan has never looked back since then.Son of a retired police officer from Daman, Chauhan credits his father for instilling discipline and hard-work -- the twin pillars he attributes to his trading success.Chauhan’s excellent technical analysis skills, coupled with his knowledge of data science and computing skills, makes him a lethal trader -- one who you would not like to bet against in the market.He, however, has had his shares of failures, but like every successful person he has used it as a stepping stone and learning experience to move forward.In an interview with Moneycontrol's Shishir Asthana, Chauhan walks us through his journey as a trader, pausing at various hurdles he faced and finally taking us through his trading strategies.Edited excerptsNoneDuring my MBA course, we had a professor -- Avijan Dutta, who was from IIM Ahmedabad and a fund manager in his previous avatar. It was he who gave us an inside tour of the market.In one such assignment, I analysed a software company called i-Flex Solutions (now Oracle Financial Services Software), which was trading at around Rs 300 per share. I liked the stock because the company wrote software for banks to run their core operations. Given the computerisation of banks, I figured out that there would be no demand-side issues for the company. My price target for the company was Rs 1,200 over the next four years. However, we were in the midst of the biggest bull run (2004-08) and i-Flex hit my target in a matter of months.I saw the magic unfold in front of my eyes and wanted to learn more about the market. I approached my professor and asked him how I could learn more about the market. He told me that fundamental analysis is only one small segment of the overall market and directed me towards technical analysis.In the final year of two-year full-time MBA, I did a very detailed project on technical analysis putting my software knowledge to use. I downloaded the bhav copy from both stock exchanges and fed it into open-source software, which uses various technical indicators to throw up simple trading strategies. While my project was selected as the best, the stocks I had picked during this assignment doubled in a short span of time.After the course, I decided I would like to be a technical analyst. What also tilted my decision was what my professor told me. He said that analysts are among the highest paid professionals.NoneAll throughout, my focus was on price and volume. I was taught that irrespective of whether you are a promoter, analyst, trader, fund manager or insider you can do only two things when you come to the market: buy or sell stocks. Now, if you trade in large volumes, you will leave your signature on the market.Reading price and volume data gives an insight into what the ‘smart money’ is doing. I have always looked to read the price and volume data to understand the force behind the price action.Having said that, one needs to know that the market is nothing but a mass psychology reflector. There are three emotions – fear, greed and hope – prevalent in the market at all times. One can only take unbiased decisions in the market if he is detached from these emotions.Now, markets have an inherent structure. The puzzle is to crack the structure. If you can do it, you can forecast overall behaviour to a large extent, though you may never always be right.Trading techniques can be developed using these structures. However, there is a flaw in such technique. The flaw is the bias that comes with this strategy. In order to remove these biases, I decided to codify the system. But coding the system is a huge task, if one wishes to incorporate all parameters.I started out by simplifying the process and came out with my own definition of trends. For instance, if the market does not break a three-day low, I would call it a short-term uptrend. If it crosses the 20-day high, I would call it a medium-term trend. I started introducing such codes into my system, which helped me my trading system evolve during my initial days.I know it may sound like I am boasting, but my accuracy rate was 85 percent in those days. I could give a buy or sell call with a Rs 3-5 points stop-loss on the indices. I initiated a sell call just days before the market hit the lower circuit during the 2008 crash.NoneWhile my calls were doing well, working with a retail broker had its limitation as retail clients are generally interested only in an Rs 10-15 points move.I then changed jobs and moved to the institutional broking side of a multinational bank. Here the hope was that I would be facing bigger clients who may be interested in larger price moves. This was early 2009 and I was disseminating buy calls with a target of 20 percent and a stop-loss of three percent.I still remember a Tata Steel call I recommended with an upside target of 20 percent. The head of fundamental research of this multinational bank said that the company will not have any earnings in future. Next day, the stock moved 20 percent in a single day.With each passing day, I was getting confident of my skills and felt ready to manage larger sums of money. As luck would have, my previous boss called me to ask if I was keen on managing a technical PMS (portfolio management services) fund. The offer came with a 100 percent increase in salary.NoneI was buying breakouts and they were failing. I was shorting breakdowns and the market would trade in a range. I did not help that I was managing large sums of money. This impacted me emotionally as I come from a middle-class family and this was the first-time I was dealing with such huge sums of money.Over the next one-and-a-half years the market trended sideways. At one time, my portfolio was down 20 percent but I closed the year with a loss of around five percent. I finally realised I was not that great. My boss called me and said that the returns were not acceptable.NoneMy new found interest helped me secure a job in Reuters and I was based out of their Sydney office. The job required interaction with treasury heads globally, translate their technology requirements and then work with the coding team to provide solutions. The job tested a mix of my software and quantitative finance skills. But even as I was working, I tested my currency trading skills against some of the best in treasurers across the globe. The results made me do a rethink on whether I should give myself a second chance to become a trader.Debt free and with decent savings, I decided to start my own trading firm, which could later be scaled to a hedge fund. However, life had other plans for me.Around November 2013, my wife delivered twins 28 weeks into her pregnancy. Both boys were on a ventilator for the next three months and even after that there were multiple complications which kept us preoccupied for all of 2014. Though I was able to trade well, the medical bills were fast eroding my capital.With my emotional risk capital shrinking, I had to accept destiny and decided to join Monarch Networth Capital as head of their trading desk in Mumbai.NoneIn my over three years at Monarch, I put to use all my learning and traded options consistently without a single losing month. Over the years, I learnt that my strength is in predicting directional moves and using my quantitative skill to predict volatility. For an options trader, the two essential tools are a view on the direction of the underlying and a view on volatility.We regularly trade four-to-five systems, which help stabilised our monthly return around 2-3 percent.There is a step-wise process by which we trade for each strategy. It starts with running a scanner based on quantitative models that have been developed by me. The output of this scanner is a list of stock that have a high probability of unidirectional moves.The second step is to check the volatility range of each stocks. This can be based on either Implied Volatility Rank (IV Rank) or IV Percentile.Recently, we initiated a trade in Yes Bank where the IV percentile was 90 and another in IndusInd Bank with an IV percentile of 15. Both had cleared the filter of prospective stocks for a big move, but had different IV percentiles, so they had to be treated differently.We initiated the Yes Bank trade when the stock was trading around Rs 170 per share. Since the IV Percentile was high, it suggested a strong move. We sold a 1:2 ratio call spread of 220 and 240 strikes (bought one 220 call and sold two 240 calls). At the time of initiating the trade, the risk on the trade was Re 1, or Rs 1,750 per lot. We exited from the trade when the spread touched Rs 15. In the case of IndusInd Bank, which had a lower IV, we went long on the future contract and hedged it with a put contract.Understanding volatility is very important for an options trader. It is said that volatility is mean-reverting. While it is true, volatility also seeks extremes. Since volatility moves in a range, it can be mean-reverting in a range. But when it moves out of that range, it enters a new range where the ‘mean’ also shifts.Volatility is stickier on the lower side of the range. For instance, consider volatility of the Nifty, which generally moves between 10 and 24. However, it can spend months in the 10-11 range than at higher ranges.Despite the precautions we take in picking up a stock, I have found that my trades can still go wrong.This is where the third part of our process kicks in – adjustment and management of the trade. Every option structure has a different hedging mechanism. Each trade has to be handled on its own merit. The idea is to lock in the loss as soon as possible. The beauty of trading options is that you can hedge and protect your trades using a variety of methods.NoneOn March 13, the Bank Nifty had a very high open interest at 28,500, but this was challenged and the market moved up to 28,600. The underlying was showing a lot of strength, but 28,700and 28,800 strikes were witnessing good amount of call writing. Volatility was high and we expected the 28,700 and 28,800 strikes to be challenged.The best way to trade this situation was to create a call back spread, where you sell a call of a lower strike and buy two calls of higher strikes in a back spread. The key here is that one should not look at the expiry payoff, but at shorter timeframe of T+2 or T+3.While trading indexes, I have an inter-index offsetting position. Though this does not give me large profits, it helps curb my losses.NoneThe most important thing to note in trading using this strategy on expiry day is ‘Pinning the Strike’ which is basically getting the strike price where the strategy will be initiated.Like on May 31, 2018, the market suggested that FII holding limit in HDFC Bank would increase. The expectation was that Bank Nifty would open higher and it did. However, it soon started correcting and so did the HDFC Bank.But data showed an increase in open interest in HDFC Bank call options, even as the price was going down. In Bank Nifty, the open interest increased from two lakh to 27 lakh contracts. Data suggested that Bank Nifty may shoot up, so we created a 200-point Iron Butterfly, which was 300 points away from where the market was, at a cost of Rs 180. Within an hour, the market moved higher and we covered the trade at 80 points, giving us a quick Rs 100 profit per lot.But like all traders, even I am subjected to greed. I took another 200 points Iron Butterfly, 100 points away from the strike that I had created earlier. But the market kept on moving and this short Iron Butterfly, which was created at 160 points, was booked at 190 points. As this position was bigger than the earlier one, it took away a portion of the earlier loss. But without this structure, we would have incurred a bigger loss.We do initiate a lot of intra-day trades, but these are all spreads which define our risks. Here too we look at the volatility before entering a trade.For example, if the volatility is in the lower quartile of the last 52-week range, then we know that the market is not nervous. We look to sell at-the-money (ATM) straddles – selling an ATM call and put.NoneIn all our trades, we follow our four trading steps. The first is scanning our list of most liquid stocks. Two, look for where they are on the volatility spectrum. We then pick up an option structure through which we would initiate the trade. Finally, when we are in the trade, we look to actively manage to maximise profits.NoneSince trading is all about maths, I am not talking about arithmetic skills, but about the ability to play around with numbers. So, if I were to reduce the number of days in a Black & Scholes model, then that person should know how it will impact option premium. So, inquisitiveness is necessary.Statistics is about understanding the terms and their relationship with options. A person becomes very objective if his understanding of statistics is strong. If one were to ask what is the probability of the price covering a distance of three standard deviations, then that person should confidently say that with a 99 percent chance this can be achieved in only two percent of cases. Artificial intelligence or machine learning is all about statistics and about fitting the regression line, or in layman’s terms following the market’s price.Programming is the most difficult but is an important skill that a quant trader should possess. If on a 15-minute candle there is a sell signal and if on the daily chart of the same underlying there is a certain behaviour, I should know how the market behaved during previous occasions.My edge is the ability to process such information at a faster pace. In a single trading day, there are 375 minutes, so if you include all stocks and instruments associated with it across all expiries, we would have 3.75 lakh data points. In a span of 10 years, it would be 48 crore data points. A normal SQL (Structured Query Language) query cannot go through such data fast enough. I have spent over a month to learn a new language that can scan through the data fast enough to retrieve the information I need in a matter of 0.6 seconds.Your ability to scan through the data will provide you an edge in the market. I will be at an advantage, if I knew beforehand how the Bank Nifty behaved when its open interest spiked by 20 percent in the at-the-money strike, which occurred with an implied volatility (IV) spike of two percent. The behaviour of the market in the past will give me an edge against those who are unaware of it.The fourth skill is the ability to know which instrument class to trade under various situations. If you do not understand the nitty-gritty of option Greeks and its behaviour under various situations, you would be missing out on the opportunity to trade with the most optimal instrument. In our trading, we work on managing the second derivative Greeks like Volga and Vanna, which requires a robust knowledge of option structures.Finally, if you are working in a business that requires client-servicing, you need strong communication skills, especially when it comes to a complex product like quant-based options trading.None"

content,"Sovit Manjani'Algo-trading' and 'systematic trading' have been buzz words of late. There have been various myths around it. Algo or algorithm basically means a set of rules or steps which are followed in a sequence to achieve an end result.Most of us use algorithms unknowingly. In Mumbai, if one has to reach Nariman Point from Lokhandwala Complex, Andheri then he or she can take the following steps. First take an auto-rickshaw to Andheri Station, from there take a local train till Churchgate Station. Then take a taxi till Nariman Point. This travel is an example of an algorithm.The whole journey had a sequence of steps and the decision was made at each point. If, for example, the rickshaw is not available, he or she could have taken a bus or a taxi.If you think about your daily routine, from the time you wake up till the time you go to bed at night, everything can be defined as part of an algorithm.Algorithms are used in almost all fields of our day to day activities the only difference is that we use the human brain instead of computers.Computers have an advantage; they do not get distracted or deviate from the output. In the above example, a human may get distracted by wrong advice from a co-passenger and leave the train at Marine Lines instead of Churchgate.Have you noticed that once you search for a product on the internet say for example a bicycle and each time you open your browser it shows recommendations for a bicycle?How does that happen? It is the computer which learns your behaviour patterns from your input in the browser and throws the advertisement based on it. This is an algorithm.Algorithms can be used for investing and trading as well. Legendary investors like Warren Buffett also use algorithms although they have trained their minds to not deviate from their rules. Buffett has disclosed a few of his rules.He would only invest in stable companies. Now, defining stable company might be a challenge for a computer. One way it can be done is that if the top line and bottom line are growing steadily year on year say for five or 10 years then the business can be assumed to be stable.Whereas, if in one year either the sales or profit spikes up and the next year it spikes down then the business can be assumed to be unstable and it has to be omitted for further processing.Another rule of Buffett is to buy at bargain prices; he will buy a stock when the market misprices it in the periods of crises. For example, he bought banking stock after the financial crises; his understanding was that banking as a business will survive.Economies cannot function without banks and financial institutions. One way to define it is that a business like real estate in India was and still available at price to book of less than five, which would be a 10 year lowest valuations.Housing is an industry which will survive as people cannot live on the internet or moon.The advantage of computerised algorithms is that the system will not give any buy signal until all the conditions are met.The rules can be back-tested and analysed to know that the rule has any edge or not. It becomes easier to be patient and disciplined.Algorithms can be used for investment as well as trading. It can be for high frequency, mid frequency, and low frequency. It can be for trend following, mean reversion, contra trend, pattern detection, news-based trading as well.The best part is that all the above can be done simultaneously on multiple asset classes like stocks, futures, options, commodities, currencies and cryptocurrencies. There is no limit to the usage of algos. They are here to stay.(The author is Co-Founder, Head of Trading Strategies at Dravyaniti Consulting LLP)"

title,"With many contenders vying for the Wayanad seat, will Rahul Gandhi win from the Congress bastion?"
datetime,2019-04-01 16:37:00+00:00
description,"Wayanad is said to be the safest seat for the Congress party, with many contenders vying for it. "
content,"A little after 11am on Sunday, as Kerala Congress workers waited with bated breath, former defence minister AK Antony announced that Congress President Rahul Gandhi will be contesting from the Wayanad parliamentary seat in the southern state. As soon as the announcement was made, workers were jubilant.Wayanad, in North Kerala, shares its borders with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The state unit believes that Rahul contesting from the seat will provide an impetus to the Congress footprint in south India.The Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency is spread across three revenue districts – Wayanad, Kozhikode and Malappuram – and comprises seven assembly seats. It came into being in 2009 after the delimitation of constituencies.Congress bastion?The first MP from the seat was senior Congress leader MI Shanavas, who had won with a huge margin of 1.5 lakh votes, defeating CPI’s M Rahmathulla.Shanavas retained the Wayanad seat in the 2014 general election, but with a relatively low victory margin of 20,000 votes.In November 2018, about six months ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shanavas died at the age of 67 years. The seat has been vacant since then.Wayanad is said to be the safest seat for the Congress, with many contenders vying for it.What about infighting among factions?The Congress in Kerala is divided into two factions – the Antony (A) faction led by former chief minister Oommen Chandy, and the Indira (I) faction led by Ramesh Chennithala.Shanavas belonged to the ‘I’ faction and hence Chennithala had demanded the seat for his cadre.Meanwhile, Chandy had been lobbying for the candidature of his close aide and young leader T Siddique from the Wayanad constituency. Even before the party had declared a candidate from the seat, Siddique had started campaigning in the district.Candidates from other parties vying for the seatThe Left Democratic Front has announced CPI’s PP Suneer as its candidate from Wayanad, while the BJP has given the seat to its ally, the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS).Earlier, the BJDS had fielded political greenhorn Paily Vathiattu. However, after Rahul’s candidature was announced from Wayanad, BJDS chief Thushar Vellappally declared that he will be contesting himself to take on Gandhi.A Winnable FactorThe Congress has represented the Wayanad seat twice in Parliament. Of the seven assembly seats its includes, four are held by the CPI(M) and the rest by the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).Besides, Wayanad has a strong pro-Congress voter base, with Muslims and Christians forming over 50 percent of the votebank and traditionally voting for the Congress and its ally IUML (Indian Union Muslim League). In addition, the constituency is a prominent agrarian belt of Kerala.What are the issues facing Wayanad?With only 3.86 percent people living in urban areas, a major chunk is involved in farming activities. Rural distress, hence, is a major issue in the area. Pepper and coffee are major crops, which were affected adversely during the 2018 floods that ravaged the state.NonePolitical ramifications of Rahul's announcementThe announcement spells good news for the Grand Old Party and the larger UDF that it heads in the southern state. The party also hopes that Rahul contesting from Wayanad has a ripple effect in the areas surrounding it, in an attempt to establish their foothold in the Malabar belt.The announcement ism however, not good news for CPI's candidate from the seat, PP Suneer. In fact, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan repeatedly charged at the Congress, saying Rahul contesting from Wayanad is an attempt to attack the Left in the state and not the BJP. This underlines the bitterness that the local Congress shares with Left in Kerala, even if they have a cordial relationship in New Delhi."

content,"NoneThe consolidated entity started the operation with a business mix of over Rs 15 lakh crore on the balance sheet, with deposits and advances of Rs 8.75 lakh crore and Rs 6.25 lakh crore, respectively.BoB, the second largest public sector lender after State Bank of India (SBI), now has over 9,500 branches, 13,400 ATMs, and 85,000 employees to serve 12 crore customers.The largest nationalised bank now has an expanded capital base and will be in a position to have deeper banking relationship with customers.To make merger a smooth affair, the government last week decided to infuse Rs 5,042 crore in BoB to enhance its capital base to meet additional expenses.Meanwhile, BoB completed share allotment to shareholders Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank as per the scheme of amalgamation.Shareholders of Vijaya Bank got 402 equity shares of BoB for every 1,000 shares held. In the case of Dena Bank, its shareholders received 110 shares of BoB for every 1,000 shares.The bank on Monday issued and allotted equity shares at approved share exchange ratio pursuant to 'Amalgamation of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda Scheme, 2019', BoB said in a regulatory filing.Shares of BoB closed at Rs 132.85 per unit, up 3.14 per cent on BSE.The first three-way amalgamation is the first step in the consolidation of public sector banking industry recommended in 1991 by the Narasimham Committee report. Through this merger the government has created an institution of global scale and size, thereby providing significant benefit to all stakeholders.Consolidated entity will be able to realise multiple synergy benefits both on cost and revenue sides.Post-amalgamation, the bank will have a 22 per cent market share in Gujarat and 8-10 per cent market share in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the bank has said.All customers of Dena Bank, which is under prompt corrective action (PCA) framework of the RBI, will have renewed access to credit facilities immediately.The government in September last year announced the first-ever three-way consolidation of banks in India, with a combined business of Rs 14.82 lakh crore, making it the third-largest bank after State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank.The announcement of the three-way merger was among several reforms initiatives undertaken by Financial Services Secretary Rajiv Kumar to make public sector banks (PSBs) healthy, robust and globally competitive.As part of the reform process, the government had also announced transfer of majority 51 per cent stake to Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) in IDBI Bank in August last year to transform the Mumbai-based lender.Besides, the Department of Financial Services made a record capital infusion of Rs 1.06 lakh crore in the PSBs in the fiscal 2018-19. As a result five public sector banks including Bank of India, Corporation Bank and Allahabad Bank were out of the prompt corrective action framework of the RBI earlier this year. Non-performing assets (NPAs) showed a negative trend in 2018-19 and reduced by Rs 23,860 crore between April-September 2018."

People speak different languages, have different food and beverage habits, have different motivations for consuming food and beverages,"" said T Krishnakumar, Chief Executive Officer of Coke's business in India and Southwest Asia.It was the smaller beverage companies that realised the demand of packaged drinks with traditional flavours like jaljeera (cumin-flavoured water) and aam panna (raw mango drink). Bengaluru-based Hector Beverages, Mumbai's Xotic Frujus and Rajasthan’s Jayanti Group are way ahead of Coke in the game.As the summer season kicks off, Coca-Cola's aam panna will be available in stores across India. The company will soon launch its carbonated version of jaljeera. By 2020, the beverage maker will get into dairy products like spiced buttermilk and yogurt-based drinks in India."

content,"Expanding its 'Make in India' portfolio, Apple has now started making its iPhone 7 model in India. This move will help the government's agenda of promoting India as a manufacturing hub. The company already makes iPhone SE and iPhone 6s locally.NoneManufacturing iPhones in India costs the company lesser than expenditure involved in importing, because of the duty concessions from the government. However, this does not mean lower prices though, as analysts said the company will invest the money made from these devices to push sales and marketing.Wistron recently got the Centre's approval for its proposal to widen its manufacturing capacity worth Rs 5,000 crore to manufacture high-end Apple devices.Navkender Singh at IDC India believes that iPhone 7 is a low-risk product for Apple to make in India. ""To that extent, the local manufacturing is about revalidating Apple's India manufacturing capability before they scale up to other models,"" he said.2018 was a tough year for the iPhone maker as sales took a hit. Apple overhauled its management and sales strategy and is focusing on India. Analysts said the company wants to make India a manufacturing and export hub, in the backdrop of US-China tensions. Due to stiff competition from Chinese phone makers like Xiaomi, Apple's market share in India dropped from 2.4 percent in 2017 to 1.2 percent in 2018.Singh said that local manufacturing is not going to help regain market share, which will still be low in 2019. However, the company will be able to test the manufacturing segment for its high-end models."

Fall and risk a fracture or break a limb. Reach the other end and earn admiration. You need nerves to even watch it.Buying unlisted shares available in a distress sale is akin to a tightrope walk. Whether you simply buy the shares of unlisted companies that its existing investors want to sell or from an alternate investment fund (AIF) that investors wish to exit midway, or even shares held by employees — these are some of the opportunities that could prop up time and again.If you’re vigilant, patient and have the money to spare there could be a fortune.

Instead, a fair value of the share is arrived at; more of that, later.“If you have good connections across wealth management outfits then you keep getting deals frequently wherein investors are willing to exit at 20% to 30% discount. Cash in your hand is really a king in such cases,” says a wealth manager who does not wish to be identified.Then, there are up and coming companies, typically of sunshine industries, that could get listed sometime in future. Nobody knows when, but some of these companies can get listed in future. In the meantime, they may offer their shares to some of their existing employees, in the form of employee stock-options, as a means to retain them.When these companies do get listed and their shares fetch a good price, it helps existing employees to sell some or all of their existing shares at a premium.Shares of unlisted companies especially the new age companies in financial services, e-commerce, non-bank finance companies (NBFC) are on the watchlist.Some of the shares of unlisted companies that are traded include HDB Financial, Hero Fincorp, ANI Technologies (OLA), B9 Beverages (Bira), Mohan Meakin (Old Monk), One97 Communications (Paytm), Barbeque Nation and Zomato.“Along with future earnings growth and the right buying price, the promoter’s willingness to protect the interests of the minority shareholders play a key role while choosing an investment in the space of unlisted shares,” says Shyam Sekhar, chief ideator and founder, of Chennai-based iThought.If you invest in well-managed businesses with promoters who believe in wealth creation over long term and are willing to share it with co-owners – that is minority shareholders, then there is a fair chance of making money. Professionally managed companies, companies having non-promoter institutional holding are seen as less risky bets, though there is no sure success formula to ascertain promoter’s integrity.Unlike listed stocks and mutual funds, you won’t get information very easily in this space. Nor would you have research reports from all stock brokers. You have to ask questions to the firm that is arranging these shares for you or the market maker, if any.“The prices oscillate a lot depending upon the demand for and supply of the shares. Investors must ascertain the intrinsic value of the share and arrive at a fair value before investing. Otherwise, they end up buying something at a very high price just because it was in high demand at the time purchase,” says Haresh Nagpal, a chartered accountant based in Ludhiana.As there is no formal market for these stocks, liquidity is a serious issue and one should never overlook. In the past, many such companies later announced initial public offers (IPO). That made many investors rich.Shyam Shekhar is one such person. He could see prices of shares of ICICI Lombard quadrupling as it went for IPO. He also remembers an 80% price hike in over two years in share price of ICICI  Prudential Life Insurance.Then, there are AIFs; these typically has a lifespan of five to seven years and the same can be extended by a year or two. The idea is to invest in the first three years of the fund and then reap the benefits of the investments over the remaining lifespan of the fund. A typical AIF may start seeing payback from fourth or fifth year onwards.“Investors buying a unit of an existing AIF in its third year having a tenure of around five to seven years have better visibility of earnings as compared to investors who invest at the beginning of the AIF,” says Krishna Raghavan, founder and deputy CEO of UnlistedKart, a firm specialising in pre-IPO shares and secondary transfers having offices in Bangalore and Mumbai.When an AIF starts, all its plans are on paper and it invests in various opportunities and tracks the growth and takes corrective actions. An investor who is investing mid-way knows how the fund has done so far and has a clear idea of how the things are working out.If at this juncture if one gets to invest at a massive discount to the fair value and decent visibility of future then there could be a glimmer of an opportunity here.Units of AIFs floated by IDFC, Carpediem Capital, Motilal Oswal, ASK are being traded.Understanding a distress saleBefore we get into it, one should look at opportunities in the secondary market in such exotic investment options, let’s understand why they exist in first place.Many a times investors underestimate liquidity. In times when you need cash, you wish to sell your investments. Since these type of investments are meant for high networth individuals and typically there’s a large chunk of money in such securities, investors rush to sell if they need the cash. That’s a big reason why investors with shares of unlisted companies try to sell them albeit at a discount.At other times, an asset class may not have done well so far and may not be expected to do as well in near future too. AIFs that invested in real-estate sector are an example.AIFs require a minimum investment amount like Rs 1 crore. Investors are expected to give money in tranches over a period of, say, three years. Sometimes investors sign up with an initial payment of Rs 25 lakh but later go back on their commitments due to paucity of funds or some of reasons mentioned earlier.But the fund’s investment activities can’t stop for a few investors’ inability to pay up. In such ‘default cases’ it becomes necessary to give exit to such investors by bringing in new investors at a later stage.“Many of these exotic investments are showcased to investors as a symbol of exclusivity though some of the themes are already available on mutual fund platform,” says Ranjit Dani, founder and director of Think Consultants – a wealth management firm based in Nagpur.Dani also cautions investors that since commissions from selling MFs are falling, many distributors try and sell these exotic products to investors because they pay higher commissions.Should you buy?“If you are a trader then unlisted shares are not your cup of tea. It is a game best played by long term investors,” says Nitin Rao an investor based in Mumbai and founder of Alpha Ideas, an investment blog for Indian markets.Most of the names in the unlisted shares space that are traded are in the initial years of the growth. If you understand the size of the opportunity and are happy to watch your investments grow over long period of time, then you should be investing in these companies.But it’s not that easy. Beware of the counterparty risk, which means you may transfer the funds, but there is no guarantee that you may get the shares.“Investors must insist on signing a memorandum of understanding before initiating any transaction. It clearly defines the transaction and protects rights of the parties involved in the transaction,” says Krishna Raghavan.Another risk of buying unlisted shares on the hope to cash out on IPO is that the IPO may not happen anytime soon. There is no guarantee about the IPO. Also there is no assurance that you would get an exit before IPO comes.“Come with a mindset to hold your investments for five years. If IPO is announced then you get an exit. Also you can sell your shares one year after listing,” says Nitin Rao.“There are instances of IPO not making money for you,” says Haresh Nagpal. He points out that some investors bought shares of MSTC, ahead of IPO at around Rs 400. The IPO came at Rs 120. “You have to be a savvy investors to make money in such investments. If you are done with normal financial planning and want to put some money in high risk high return category then you may consider these investments. Otherwise just stay away.”The net asset values of AIF must also be taken with a pinch of salt. AIFs make assumptions like how much cash underlying companies are expected to make, but these factors are susceptible to change.Understand the underlying assets before investing. “Real estate sector is in poor shape. Developers’ are carrying very high inventory of unsold real estate and investors are not yet selling out in panic. Over supply should ensure that real estate sector won’t see uptick in near future,” says Ranjit Dani.Finally, illiquidity is the big and obvious risk here. Unless these companies get listed, they continue to suffer from illiquidity.“AIF may extend the tenure of the fund by a year or two. Investors should also understand the charges associated with each scheme, as post tax and post charges returns matter for investor and not the valuation at which AIF exits a particular investment,” says Abhishek Gupta, founder and chief financial planner of Moat Wealth Advisors. He recommends investing in such opportunities if and only if you have completely understood the portfolio and risk reward associated with it.All retail investors, stay away."

title,Demand for homegrown animation content growing; India no longer just an outsourcing hub
datetime,2019-04-02 12:53:00+00:00
description,"While Indian content on television is seeing traction, locally produced animation films have seen lesser growth."
content,"NoneThe domestic broadcasting of animated content is growing at a healthy rate and now accounts for 30-35 percent of the revenue generated by the Indian animation segment. This number will continue to increase in the future, with a yearly growth rate expected to be around 30 percent.Instead of licensing library content, Indian animation studios are investing in originals with the budgets for such shows doubling in the last decade.Talking to Moneycontrol, Anish Mehta, CEO, Cosmos Maya, said, “Broadcasters are launching newer shows. There is a growth in appetite. You can see now that the lion’s share is Indian content, whereas earlier only one or two shows were broadcast.”NoneWith more viewers, comes more focus for the genre.“I know the kind of investments that are lined up from all the big broadcasters,"" said Mehta. Reliance is backing Viacom, and the Star-Disney merger is also happening. ""Besides, OTT is one area where kids play a strong role because of the repeat consumption,” he added.Last year, Sony launched a channel with 100 percent locally-produced animated content. Nickelodeon plans to grow its original programming to 500 hours in FY19.NoneNoneThe company has also got strategic projects going on with three big networks – Disney, Nickelodeon and Turner.Explaining how the focus on home-grown animated content has increased considerably in India, Mehta said, “If I pass the trajectory of the last seven years, we started off in 2012 with 26.5 hours of hours per year that we were delivering in the first year. Since then, there has been a consistent growth. Around 36 percent per month is only Indian content. The market has definitely grown five-fold,” said Mehta.However, oversees remains a key market for the company and that is because “at several levels, international markets are very strategic. We are still to reach the quality where we will be matching up with oversees players becuase of their planning stage, production, budgets, timeline and storytelling.”Last year, Indian animation services continued to gain traction among international production houses especially due to cost efficiency, which is up to 50 percent compared to other countries. In addition, animation quality has improved over the last few years. Due to the cost advantage, international studios and animation houses are increasingly utilizing services from India.During the last few years, Indian animation studios have worked with major international players such as Disney, Warner Brothers, DreamWorks, Sony, Viacom/Nickelodeon, BBC, Cartoon Network, Fox, Ubisoft and Zynga, among others.NoneWhile Indian content on television is seeing traction, locally produced animation films have seen lesser growth.“Adults consume animation because the adults today are the ones who grew up with Cartoon Network in India. Professionals in India today take from mid 20’s to early 40’s. They had exposure to animated content as kids so the next generation is taking up to it a little bigger way. A couple of years down the line, we will be able to mirror American trends,” said Mehta.NoneBut the genre has now more screens to bank on courtesy the digital medium.According to the EY report, growth of digital content consumption in India created a significant opportunity for broadcasters and OTT platform providers. Animation-based content had a major share in this growth of online content consumption.Cosmos Maya in 2016 had started a YouTube channel called WowKidz and has plans to get innovative for the mobile screen.“We have been using it as a second screen. Although we do not use too much innovation in our content right now, yet it is definitely on the cards with the overall growth that has come our way,” said Mehta.Mehta expects the animation industry to continue to grow at this rate. “Yardsticks indicate that it will,” he added.“For India, what’s interesting is the Disney-Star merger with the presence of OTT platform Hotstar, which has not done anything in the kids space yet. Netflix is also consolidating in India, so there are newer opportunities coming our way,” he added.The industry is also betting big on regional content. “Leading broadcasters are airing their content in many languages. Kids prefer to watch content in their mother tongue. I won’t be surprised if a couple of years down the line, a regional channel opens up,” said Mehta.Discovery Kids gained a lot of traction in terms of viewership, courtesy the launch of Tamil and Telugu language feeds for its channel as part of its regional expansion plan in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana."

content,"Subramanian Swamy, one of the ruling party’s top MPs, who refuses to use the prefix “Chowkidaar” with his name unlike the other leaders, has always been in the news for making sensational claims about the Gandhi family.The leader known to stir controversies was at it once again in a recent event.NoneGoing forward with his unabashed criticism of Rahul, Swamy said he doesn't even know how to wear a sacred thread (janeu), which is a trademark of Brahmins. He also pointed out that Rahul wears the janeu over his clothes, which is not the correct way of wearing it.The BJP leader further claimed that Rahul Gandhi is actually Christian (an allegation often levelled against Rahul’s sister Priyanka Gandhi). To back his statement, he said there is a chapel inside Rahul’s house, which is visited by a Malayali priest every Sunday to come and perform rites to atone his sins. While there is no way to empirically substantiate these claims, it didn’t deter Swamy from continuing with his scathing attacks.When he was asked why no action has been taken against Rahul for carrying multiple passports, he said he has already written to the Ethics Committee of Parliament, but they are yet to initiate action.He added, he has additionally written to the MHA and provided all the supporting documents."

description,There cannot be a better role for someone like Rajan who has shown keen interest in nurturing startups. 
content,"Rajan Anandan, Vice President Google India and South East Asia, is quitting the company to join Sequoia Capital India as an investor and mentor for startups.There cannot be a better role for someone who has shown keen interest in nurturing startups. In addition to investing in multiple startups, Anandan was the President of Delhi Chapter of The Indus Entrepreneurs, a non-profit organisation that nurtures entrepreneurship.If Anandan mentored and encouraged early-stage tech startups as an investor, he has spearheaded several initiatives that boost ecosystem in the country as the vice president. Next Billion Users initiative is one of those.The initiative is aimed at developing products specifically for emerging markets such as India. Since the launch happened a couple of years back, the tech major has come out with India-only applications such as Neighbourly, a social network platform for the neighbourhood, where you can get your queries answered. First launched in Mumbai, it was expanded to five more cities.The tech giant launched ‘Solve for India’ initiative to reach out to entrepreneurs in tier II and III towns in 2017. Through this initiative, the entrepreneurs from smaller towns would be able to gain access to direct mentoring and support from Google.While most of these initiatives were directed globally, Anandan played a significant role in taking it a notch further for which he was awarded the IMPACT person of the year in 2018.The initiatives include ‘Navlekha’, Google’s platform for Indian users who are not conversant with English, Google ‘Internet Saathi’, an initiative to bring more rural women online, and the Indian Railways high-speed Wi-Fi project, providing free Wi-Fi to consumers at railway stations across the country.When he addressed entrepreneurs to announce Google’s partnership with 91Springboard last year, his enthusiasm while interacting with entrepreneurs was contagious. He explained how the partnership network could help companies that are suffering from critical issues such as sanitation education and mobility space.For Anandan, developing the ecosystem was as important as nurturing startups, and he clearly believed that the technology was necessary to solve problems India had been facing.It was not just about entrepreneurship though. Google Payments was launched last year. YouTube in India grew, and there were significant product developments such as Maps.NoneNoneIf there is one thing that Anandan was not successful in, it would be his role in establishing responsible social media. The tech giant has been accused by MakeMyTrip and BharatMatrimony of manipulating search results (the case with latter is still going on in NCLAT). While the company has continuously declined the allegations, it has not taken any concrete steps to address those either.With Anandan quitting, his successor has his task cut out. “Google should play a significant role in responsible social media, where none of them has come forward,” Sachin Taparia, CEO - LocalCircles, said."

title,Opinion | NDA has a slight edge over the grand alliance. Will it be enough?
datetime,2019-04-02 16:26:00+00:00
description," The absence of the Left parties from the anti-BJP grand alliance means that votes in their pockets of influence will be divided, which will inevitably help the BJP."
content,"Rajeev SharmaWith 40 Lok Sabha seats, Bihar is crucial for any political party that has a serious claim to form a government at the Centre. The stakes are higher for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance which won 31 and 32 Lok Sabha seats 40 in the 2014 and 2009 general elections, respectively.Indeed, the BJP and allies need to further improve their 2014 tally if they want to see Narendra Modi retain power, though there doesn’t seem to be much scope for improvement. But that’s a tough task.One must not forget the important fact that the Janata Dal (United) and its leader Nitish Kumar were part of the LK Advani-choreographed NDA in 2009. The NDA had won 32 seats in Bihar after ensuring that Narendra Modi, then chief minister of Gujarat, didn’t enter the northern state. It was thus entirely a Nitish Kumar show in 2009. Effectively, it means that this will be the first time that Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi fight the polls together and on the same platform.One should not also forget how Kumar overnight dumped his RJD-Congress coalition partners, embraced a new partner, the BJP, and retained the chief ministership in July 2017. He could do this because the arithmetic of the 243-member Bihar assembly was favourable for such a switch-over: JDU (71), RJD (80), Congress (27) and BJP (53). There may well be a strong undercurrent among the voters of Bihar against the turncoat Kumar which, needless to say, will be exploited by the RJD-led grand coalition.Yet, the NDA has a perfect pitch to bat and pull off a victory in the Bihar test match. It’s largely because of the fact that the opposition “mahagathbandhan"" or grand alliance is like a boat with several holes.One reason is that the RJD, the mother ship of the grand alliance,  is facing a revolt within, much like the Shiv Sena of Bal Thackeray's last days and the two main Dravidian parties -- DMK and AIADMK. Though Tejaswi Yadav has taken control of the RJD, his elder brother Tej Pratap has of late been on a path of revolt, upset over the party giving ticket to his estranged wife's father Chandrika Rai. Though Tej Pratap won't be able to do much, his revolt does trigger negative vibes about the party in public perception.The RJD is contesting 20 seats, the Congress is fighting on nine, the RLSP (Rashtriya Lok Samata Party) five seats, Hindustani Awam Morcha (S) and Vikashsheel Insaan Party (VIP) are three seats each. One seat has been offered to CPI-ML (liberation), a major Left force in Bihar, from the RJD’s own quota. The two national Left parties—CPI and CPM—have been left out.The 134-year-old Congress party is trying to piggy back on the RJD to stop the NDA juggernaut which decimated the non-BJP coalition in past two general elections. The Congress had first pitched for 16 seats, but it scaled down its demand to 13 seats and then to 11 seats.Finally, the Congress agreed to just nine seats, while giving up its claim on the traditional Aurangabad seat (which Congress wanted to be allotted to its candidate Nikhil Kumar, a former governor) which has gone to HAM(S) led by former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi. The RJD-Congress deal also includes the first Rajya Sabha seat to Congress from Bihar whenever it falls vacant.The RJD-Left parties deal breaker was over the Begusarai seat from where the CPI is fielding high-profile and controversial student leader Kanhaiya Kumar. The RJD wasn’t interested in backing the CPI’s candidate over its favoured contestant Tanveer Hasan who got almost 4 lakh votes despite the Modi wave in 2014, though he lost to BJP's Bhola Singh by a margin of over 55,000 votes. CPI's Rajendra Singh was a distant third with nearly 1.92 lakh votes.The absence of the Left parties from the anti-BJP grand alliance means that votes in their pockets of influence will be divided, which will inevitably help the BJP.Overall, the poll scenario in Bihar may offer a slight advantage to the NDA even if the opposition grand alliance seems well poised to deny the latter a free run. A similar situation seems to be prevailing in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh as well where the BJP had won 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats on its own steam, apart from two seats won by  ally Apna Dal. A below-par performance by Modi's BJP in Bihar and UP would only rock the BJP boat.Rajeev Sharma is a political analyst and columnist who tweets @Kishkindha."

description,"Patriarch Parkash Singh Badal has been Punjab CM five times, and continued to win from Lambi constituency since 1969"
content,"The Badal dynasty consists of everything that makes up a political family in India: internal feuds, family businesses, rich history in state politics and a patriarch/satrap who, despite or because of his age, holds a firm grip over the family's dynamics in state and national politics.The family line started with Raghubar Singh Badal, and then seeps down to Sukhbir Singh Badal, Raghubar's grandchild, via Parkash Singh Badal, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) supremo.From youngest sarpanch to oldest Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's father was a landlord in the Malwa belt of Punjab when Parkash was born in 1927. Raghubar became the sarpanch of his village in 1960, while his son carried on his legacy by becoming the village head in 1963. This legacy of the Badal family assuming the position of the sarpanch reportedly continued until 1998.But even before Independence, according to Parkash Badal himself, his father and grandfather were actively involved in the freedom struggle. Parkash Badal, who studied at the FC College, went on to become the youngest sarpanch in India, and then got elected to the Block Samiti.NoneParkash Singh Badal went on to become someone who appoints ministers in state cabinet, assuming the position as the Chief Minister of Punjab for the first time in 1970. During his first term, Badal led a coalition government along with Jana Sangh, where, observers indicate, the seeds of a future alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were sown. BJP has called SAD one of its oldest allies.NoneParkash Badal has headed Punjab five times, and continued to win from Lambi assembly constituency since 1969, except in 1992, when he boycotted elections. In 2017, Parkash Badal managed to win again, defeating current Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, in what was being pegged as a battle of stalwarts.Badal, according to observers, has led the state through troubled times, including militancy, by assuming a middle path. He became the oldest chief minister in India in 2016, a year before he was dethroned by Congress.The politics of business The Badals are the one of the most influential families in Punjab, and they have firmed up their influence by marrying into the Majithias and the Kairons, two other powerful dynasties in the state.Parkash Singh Badal's son, 54-year-old Sukhbir, entered politics in 1996. He was elected to Lok Sabha and has served as a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) as well. Sukhbir has also been a minister for industry during the second regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.While the family has a stake in at least four transport companies — transport being a family business — Parkash Singh lists agriculture as his primary income. Farmers are Badal senior's primary vote bank, and he has been known to hold rallies with farmers even despite his age.In 2015, the transport business put the Badals in trouble when a teenage girl died and her mother was injured after being molested and thrown off a bus in Monga district. The bus, according to reports, belonged to the Badals, and the chief minister had reportedly offered a bribe to the girl's father to buy his silence.The Badals have been accused of corruption, malpractices and monopoly due to its transport business before as well.Sukhbir, with his MBA from California State University, has handled the business while juggling it with politics.NoneCloudburstThe Badals entered the Punjab assembly poll arena in 2017 mired in controversies and charges of corruption.The SAD managed to win only 15 seats, while Congress bagged 77 seats. What was even more humiliating was that new entrant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 20 seats. SAD's partner, BJP, won three seats. In 2012, SAD had won 56 seats while the BJP had won 12.The Akali Dal also faced internal party problems. Manpreet Singh Badal, the rebel Akali Dal leader who is a minister in the Punjab government, is Sukhbir's cousin. Manpreet was sacked from the party and the government in 2010, reportedly for ""acts of indiscipline"".Another family member, Bikram Singh Majithia, brother of Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a Union minister and Sukhbir's wife, has also been bickering. The Majithias have also been publicly put down by Badal Sr, and he had, at the same gathering, put down his son by saying it is the leader that wins elections, not just performance.Key figures in Badal clan:NoneNoneNoneNone"

content,"Delhi High Court has rejected plea by Hindustan Unilever (HUL), maker of Fair and Lovely range of skin lightening and fairness cream, which claimed TV commercial by Emami Ltd for it's Fair & Handsome’ product makes fun of a male using a ladies’ cream.The Delhi High Court in its judgment dated March 27, 2019 upheld the right of Fair and Handsome to run the advertisement that shows how women’s fairness creams are not designed for use on men's tough skin.The court rejected HUL's plea, which claimed Fair and Handsome’s TV commercial to be disparaging to its own brand – Fair & Lovely.NoneThe pink-white cream is then depicted as being ineffective on men's skin while 'Fair And Handsome' is shown as an effective fairness cream even though the main active ingredient in both is Niacinamide.The ad also showed a tube that was white and pink in colour, which HUL had claimed to be a distinctive feature of their brand Fair & Lovely.HUL contended Emami, in its advertisement, makes a false claim that Fair & Lovely was ""rubbish and inefficacious"" and that its use was restricted only to women.""In view of the literature that has been posted on its own website by the plaintiff (HUL), it also cannot be said that prima facie the statements made in the advertisement regarding using of women’s cream by men is false,"" said Justice Jayant Nath.On the disparagement case, the  Court questioned, ""Can it be said that this advertisement on account of the said dialogue stated is false or misleading or unfair or deceptive? Does it amount to generic disparagement? The answer is in the negative.""An Emami spokesperson said: ""We are not surprised by the consistent strategy adopted by HUL to target Fair and Handsome on frivolous grounds across forums. We will endeavor to do everything in our realm to safeguard the best interests of consumers, by empowering them with the right information.""In the past too, HUL has targeted Fair and Handsome on unfair disparagement.Earlier, in June 2018, HUL had aired a television commercial for Men’s Fair & Lovely, showing Fair and Handsome, claiming their own product to be the original one thus causing direct disparagement to Fair and Handsome. The Court provided an injunction in favour of Fair and Handsome, restraining HUL from circulating and displaying the commercial."

content,"Bengaluru-based smallcase Technologies is paving the way for modern investors allowing them to choose from professionally tailored baskets of stocks that reflect an investing idea or strategy.Currently, seven brokers have a collaboration with the company and are offering this platform. They include Kotak Securities, HDFC Securities, 5paisa, Edelweiss, Zerodha and Axis Securities.How does smallcase work?smallcase account allows an investor to buy and sell tradable securities based on the predefined combinations.To use the platform, follow these steps:None-Once logged in, choose from the array of themes such as all-weather, smart beta, bargain buys among others.-You will now be able to see stocks that form the portfolio, their proportion and the rationale behind their inclusion. You can customise the small case by adding or removing stocks.-While some brokers allow you to create your personalised smallcase, others offer curated smallcases.NoneFor example, in this smallcase, titled Zero Debt, companies with no debt burden and high ROE with an established track record of high earnings growth have been selected. Source: smallcase.com-Once your smallcase selection is finalised, you will be prompted to the payment gateway. The price and weight of individual stocks will dictate the minimum amount you shall pay for the smallcase, viz. in the above example, the minimum amount is Rs 16,331.-Once the payment is complete, the broker platform will place buy orders for all stocks, which will be executed immediately depending on liquidity.-In case illiquidity leads to non-fulfilment of a few orders, the investor will be able to go back and 'repair' their order, then or later, upon which a fresh order will be placed. Repairing is required to ensure the portfolio matches the original theme.NoneThese are one-time fee for one smallcase. For further orders in the same smallcase, no extra charges will be applicable.Though, the regular brokerage and other charges for buying and selling stocks will be deducted for every order.Why you should go the smallcase route-Investment in equity funds attracts expense ratio that includes fund management, distributor's commission and other expenses. This expense ratio is annually deducted from your investment in the equity fund and roughly equates to 1-1.5 percent of the investment.In comparison, you only pay brokerage for smallcases (after the initial order). smallcases charges no extra investment fee.-While investment in mutual funds gets you fund units, smallcase investment puts shares in your demat account. This is beneficial as the investors get tax free dividend directly in their bank accounts.-smallcase enables you to invest in ideas rather than in stocks based on market capitalisation. For example, one can invest in companies that are working towards affordable housing projects if the focus of the government is on providing affordable housing to all. No equity fund is there that will provide such exposure.-Redemption request with an equity mutual fund usually takes three working days to get processed. With smallcase, an investor can track investments in real-time during the market hours. Request for redemption is also placed in real time as adequate liquidity is one of the stock selection parameters used in smallcases. This, in turn, facilitates quicker redemptions."

content,"The razzmatazz and money associated with the Indian Premier League has been well documented and the title sponsorship of the event is an indicator of the eye-popping valuation the franchise-based league enjoys. From Rs 200 crore to Rs 2,199 crore, the title sponsorship fees for the league has seen an exponential growth.NoneNone""DLF was almost synonymous with the IPL in the initial years. With a large audience and viewership across the country, DLF asserted itself as a trusted brand among the Indians,"" said Kumar.But ""during this time period (2008-2012), the company witnessed a downturn in sales and was looking to reduce its debts (approximately Rs 227 billion) by selling various assets in March 2013. So, they went against renewing the deal,"" Kumar added.In came Pepsi but its association with the cash-rich league did not prove to be beneficial for the brand.When IPL got mired in the match fixing controversy in 2013, it resulted in negative publicity for the league.""The Rs 3.96 billion (Rs 396 crore) deal with Pepsi signed in 2013 was almost double of the first 5 seasons before Pepsi reportedly pulled out of the 5-year deal in October 2015 and paid only Rs 2.38 billion (Rs 238 crore) for the 3-year sponsorship deal because of the substantial controversy involved in the match-fixing scandal,"" he said.Later, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) transferred the sponsorship rights to Vivo for Rs 190 crore for the 2016 and 2017 seasons before going on to seal the rights with a winning bid of Rs 2,199 crore for the next five seasons.Brands like Zeven, Performax, Daikin and Rupa, who are looking to expand their presence in the Indian market, are currently driving the sponsorship market. Earlier, companies like Hero MotoCorp, Panasonic, Fly Emirates along with more consistent sponsors like Reebok, Adidas, Royal Challenge, India Cement and Nokia drove the sponsorship market.According to Kumar, earlier brands were either international or domestic leaders in their industry but the current trend seems to be pursuing a new norm.""Companies with a rich-heritage are often considered the most trustworthy and dependable brands. However, the brands driving the current sponsorship environment are focused on improving their brand image and reach to establish themselves among the local people,"" he explained.The sponsorship game for IPL has seen a sea of change. This year, many new companies have come on board but Kumar said that brands should take a closer look at their target market and region to identify the best way to optimise ROI . If planned well, brands can look at sponsoring on an OTT platform that is region-specific to reach their target audience.Also, with the rise in viewership of the league, sponsorship rates have also gone up.""Legacy brands can afford to be sponsors but startups and tech-based companies with low profit margins companies such as GoIbibo, Karbonn, Oxigen wallet, etc, will find it to be a pinch in terms of their marketing budget,"" he said.Over 100 brands have been associated with the IPL over the years but very few companies have stayed around for a long duration.""IPL sponsors mainly come in the form of title sponsors and team sponsors (visible through branding on the front, back and sides of jerseys). Mostly due to the extravagant amount of marketing required for a campaign, companies have found it difficult to utilise their marketing budget on other activities,"" said Kumar.Brands like Reebok, Adidas, Aircel, Nokia, UltraTech Cement, India Cement, Gulf Oil, Royal Challenge, DHFL and Videocon D2H are some companies who have been associated with the IPL for over seven years."

content,"MK Stalin, who will lead Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for the first time in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls, has huge shoes to fill.Son of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi, Stalin was formally appointed as chief of the party in 2018 after his father’s demise. As party president, he has two big tasks to accomplish — one, to carry the burden of a legacy that comes from being a son of the popular leader, and two, defeat the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) to gain power in the state again.In the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, Stalin will have to exhibit what he learnt from his father, one of the shrewdest politicians of the country.Early lifeStalin was born to Karunanidhi and Dayalu Ammal on March 1, 1953, and was named after Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalin.His name was a spur-of-the-moment decision by Karunanidhi, who was attending the condolence meeting of Joseph Stalin. As someone informed him about the birth of his child, Karunanidhi instantly named him after the Russian Communist party leader.Entry in politicsAt the age of 14, Stalin jumped into politics by campaigning for his father’s party in 1967. However, his official entry into the party was made in 1973 when he was inducted into the DMK’s general council.Road aheadThe way after his induction into DMK was not easy for Stalin. In 1976, the DMK government was dismissed on charges of corruption and Stalin was arrested under Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) for protesting against the Emergency, spending a year in prison.NoneNonePolitical resurgenceA political revival for Stalin and DMK came in 1989, when the party won by a handsome margin and Stalin secured a massive victory at Thousand Lights in Chennai. The leader was then titled as ‘Thalapathy’ or Commander.In 1996, Stalin was made Mayor of Chennai. Following this, people were so impressed with his work that he was referred to as ‘Managara Thanthai’ or 'Father of the City'.Stalin’s efforts, however, could not bring victory to the party and J Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK gained power in Tamil Nadu in 2001. However, Stalin and his party did not give up and came back to power in 2006.ControversiesStalin has an old relation with controversies, starting with his arrest during Emergency. Another big rumour about Stalin was regarding the abduction of TV news anchor Fathima in the late 1980s. The reports were, however, denied by the anchor in 2018.NoneIn 2001, he, along with his father Karunanidhi and uncle Murasoli Maran, was arrested in a midnight raid and charged in the Chennai flyover scam.2019 Lok Sabha pollsAhead of the April 11 polls, DMK is straddling on Stalin’s back to ride to victory. The party, with Stalin’s experience and its alliance with the Congress, the CPI, the CPI (M), the VCK, the MDMK, the IUML, the KMDK and the IJK, is looking to gain a major chunk of 39 Lok Sabha seats."

content,"PSA Peugeot Citroen, France’s largest carmaker, will make its India debut in late 2020 with the launch of the Citroen C5 Aircross SUV that will compete against current generation models like Hyundai Creta, Tata Harrier, Jeep Compass and Mahindra XUV500.The group, which is the last of the big international automotive names to come to India, has promised to launch one new model every year after its first year. These models will be made and launched in India before being introduced in other parts of the world.Speaking at its first press briefing in India, Carlos Tavares, Chairman of the managing board, Groupe PSA said, “India is an important next step for Groupe PSA as part of the Push to Pass plan to increase our international footprint and revenues. With the introduction of Citroen, our aim is to be ‘be Indian in India’ and our association with the CK Birla Group will be important to become a major player in the Indian automotive market”.Known rather for its small car, Citroen which has largely remained a European brand will be focusing on the mainstream market segment where volumes play a key role in determining profitability. Unlike Honda, Nissan and Toyota who have preferred to remain premium in India the PSA Group has decided to allow Citroen to compete in the mass market segment.PSA is looking to grab two percent market share in India within four to five years of its debut. “We don’t wish to declare that we have an aim of grabbing five percent of the market and not achieve it within the timeline. We would rather realistically target of two percent.""The group will make use of the 100,000 units a year production capacity in Tamil Nadu which will not just serve the domestic market but export market as well. The group will also establish a network for sourcing components and supplying them to its group operations worldwide.Senior executives of the group also promised a highly localised operation in India where an average of 95 percent of the vehicle will be made in India from components sourced within the country. These will include powertrain (engines and transmissions) having a local content of 90 percent.NoneAmbassador update The group is still unclear about the future of the decades-old brand Ambassador which it bought from Hindustan Motors two years ago for Rs 80 crore.“We are still reflecting on how do we use the brand Ambassador and are yet to take a decision on it. We would rather use it where it should be rightly used rather than use it just like that considering the iconic status it has”, said Linda Jackson, CEO, Citroen brand, Groupe PSA.CompetitionLike the PSA Groupe, other manufacturers are pulling up their socks with regards to the Indian market. Volkswagen Group, Kia Motors and MG Motors have already announced investments of more than Rs 15,000 crore in product and market expansion over the next few years. Homegrown heavyweights like Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors too are leaving no stones unturned to woo the future customers."

description,"One of the factors that has worked in Tejashwi's favour is his age, which, according to observers, has played a big role in him being projected as a leader with independent ideas"
content,"NoneTejashwi Yadav is a product of two fields — politics, where he reigns these days, and cricket, his passion since childhood.The youngest Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Bihar assembly, Tejashwi did not begin his journey to Delhi with his party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Instead, his journey began on the cricketing pitch.The 29-year-old was a part of the Under-15 and Under-17 Delhi teams. In fact, he entered the U-15 team at the time when Virat Kohli was its captain.Tejashwi was also a part of the Delhi Daredevils team in the Indian Premier League (IPL), but he mostly warmed the benches and did not get much chance to play.Tejashwi's cricketing days, however, did not go waste. He learned the ropes of leadership, and the importance of strategising — traits he would go on to apply in the political arena.NoneThe 'chosen one'Tejashwi has eight siblings, out of which only two are active in politics: Tej Pratap and Misa Bharati Yadav.Tejashwi, however, is the blue-eyed boy of his father and former Bihar Chief Minister, Lalu Prasad Yadav. It has been so since the beginning, and had become evident during the last elections.While Tej Pratap is reportedly not taken seriously by RJD leaders and Lalu himself, Misa recently made headlines for the wrong reasons. For instance, during a recent public rally, she said she felt like chopping off former RJD loyalist and current BJP minister Ram Kirpal Yadav's hands for his betrayal.This is where Tejashwi comes in. He has largely been measured in his public appearances and has managed to grab headlines for the right reasons.For instance, his speech in the assembly after Nitish Kumar walked out of the coalition government was praised for its balanced approach. The newly-minted, 'accidental' LoP spoke for 45 minutes, and his speech went viral on social media. The speech was hailed as the arrival of a young, dynamic leader who can improve RJD's image, and mould it according to the times.NoneChallenging timesWhile Tejashwi has had to face a number of difficulties, including Nitish Kumar joining hands with the BJP and forcing the RJD into Opposition benches, he has made the most out of it. Despite Bihar politics crawling with opposition parties trying to jostle for space, Tejashwi has managed to be the face of the Opposition in the state. He has done that even as his father, arguably his biggest supporter, is in jail in Ranchi on charges of corruption.""Tejashwi managed the alliance talks very tactfully, ensuring that every partner is happy, and strategically placed,"" a Grand Alliance leader told Moneycontrol.That said, RJD leaders have stated that Lalu Prasad built the party from scratch, while his children got everything on a platter. The forthcoming election, they say, is a chance for them— particularly Tejashwi— to prove their mettle.NoneAnother factor that has worked in Tejashwi's favour is his age, which, according to observers, has played a big role in him being projected as a leader with independent ideas. This is a whiff of fresh air for Bihar politics, ridden as it is with old stalwarts.One of the challenges that Tejashwi faces, and will continue to face, is modernising RJD while manoeuvering through complicated social engineering in Bihar. According to reports, while Tejashwi has reined in the criminal and corrupt elements within RJD, the party still has a long way to go.None"

The B2C segment has relatively higher margins and forms around 43 percent of the company’s revenue currently. Going forward, the management aims to grow this to around 60 percent. This would strengthen margins in the coming years. B2C segment is also a cash based segment, so the growth would enhance the cash flows.Asset light model to enable fast growth – The company has strategically followed an asset light approach for expansion and nearly 78 percent of the company’s network is on contracted third party patient touch points. In addition, they also provide home collection service. This has facilitated rapid expansion in the past few years.Growing industry The healthcare segment has seen immense policy support. With growing health awareness the industry is positioned to grow. Being a leading player and a strong brand, the company is positioned to capture a substantial share of this growing pie.NonePledge on promoter holding – In 2015, the promoters, in their personal capacity, pledged around 28 percent of their holdings to KKR India in order to raise funds to facilitate the exit of Warburg Pincus. This loan has been refinanced recently with Vistra ITCL (India). The promoters plan to pay off a portion of this loan through the proceeds of the issue and release a portion of the pledged shares. However, around 10 percent of the promoter holding would still remain pledged.Any default under the agreements will entitle the pledgee to enforce the pledge over these shares which may dilute the promoter holdings, increase stock volatility in adverse times.Negative covenants in Metz advisory loansMets Advisory holds around 29 percent stake in the company which is owned by the promoters of Metropolis' Ameera Shah and Dr Duru Sushil Shah. are partners in the firm. The covenants on loans taken by Metz could limit the ability of promoters as well as Metropolis to leverage in the future.Management changes and pending legal cases –Amid heated boardroom tussle and top-level changes since 2010, the company has also seen entry and exit of partners and PE firms. While most of the changes are now past, there are several outstanding legal proceedings against the company, its subsidiaries, directors and promoters. An adverse outcome of such cases could have a negatively impact the company.The company holds a 34 percent stake in Star Metropolis Health Services Middle East LLC. Due to disagreements, Star Metropolis has stopped providing any financial information. Given the situation, the entire investment has been written off the books. However, there still remains the risk of any subsequent legal dispute and misuse of the brand.Peer Analysis and valuationNoneOn analysing the performance of the company with its listed peers we see that the topline and net profit growth in the past two years have been in line with the average peer growth. EBITDA margin has also been stable at around 27 percent. Return on capital employed is healthy at 38 percent and is slightly above the peer average. At the higher price band, Metropolis’s IPO is priced at a 2019e (estimated) price-to-earnings of 37 times and an EV to EBITDA of 23 times. At these levels, valuations seem expensive but largely in line with peers.We find the business attractive and believe the industry is positioned for growth. However, given the heady valuation, we rule out significant short-term upside. However, investors may subscribe with a long term view in the stock.Follow @Ruchiagrawal"

title,Tata Steel quietly takes 92% in the erstwhile Bhushan Steel through convertible shares
datetime,2019-04-04 11:29:00+00:00
description,"We expect that the Tata’s will play nice here – and either merge the company with Tata Steel, at a possible conversion price closer to Rs 30 per share (effectively) after conversion"
content,"NoneThe Bhushan Steel resolution gave the company to Tata Steel, which renamed it to Tata Steel BSL, which continues to be listed. The latest price, Rs 34 per share.This is interesting. Because, till now, the shareholding was like this:-Tata Steel (through Bamnipal Steel): 79 crore shares (72 percent)-Banks: 11 crore shares (10 percent)-Others: 19 crore shares (18 percent)-Total: 109 crore shares.That’s a market cap of around Rs 3,500 crore so far.Tata Steel Will Invest Rs 9,000 crore at Rs 30.43 per shareNoneNoneNoneSo, if they convert all the shares:-Tata Steel will own 92.6 percent of Tata Steel BSL (old Bhushan Steel) with about 375.2 crore shares.-Banks will be diluted down to 2.7 percent-And others to 4.7 percentTotally there will be 404 crore equity shares.Is this Good, Bad or Ugly?It’s actually much much better than we earlier thought. Our view was that the first tranche of shares (79 crore odd) was issued to Tata Steel at Rs 2 per share. So they would convert the rest at Rs 2 also and therefore, see a massive dilution.This is still massive, but not quite as much.Also importantly, the Convertible shares carry an interest of 8.89 percent a year. That means about Rs 800 crore of interest will have to be paid on them till the conversion. We’ll come to this.The Tata Steel management didn’t do that – possibly because of regulation itself. The SEBI rules will not allow such a deal if it wasn’t part of the bankruptcy resolution itself. In the Bhushan Steel resolution, they didn’t mention specifically how much they would convert the optionally convertible shares at, even later. So they might have had to abide by the regulations that SEBI provided, and Rs 30 was a reasonable deal given the circumstances (the share traded at Rs 40 in January, but slid back to Rs 26 in February).How do you now value a Bhushan Steel (TATASTLBSL)?NoneEBIDTA per tonne could be pushed up to Rs 10,000 per tonne, which for Bhushan Steel at 50 lakh tonnes means an EBIDTA of Rs 5,000 crore.Subtract the depreciation and interest, and you have about Rs 900 crore in profit. Assuming you pay 30 percent tax, that’s a net profit of Rs 650 crore.A P/E multiple of 10 would provide an equity value of Rs 6,500.Spread across 404 crore shares, this is about a price of Rs. 16 per share.That would mean the current price of Rs 34 is a little high.(Note that if there is no conversion, an additional Rs 800 crore is paid as interest, that brings net profit to zero. That’s not fun.)How about EV-EBIDTA?Steel companies could be valued another way: EV to EBIDTA. EV = Enterprise Value = Equity Plus Debt.Debt is about Rs 26,000 crore (after Rs 9,000 crore is converted to equity).For an EBIDTA of Rs 5,000 crore, let’s also crosscheck what EV-EBIDTA we are paying for Tata Steel itself. The answer is about six times. JSW Steel is seven times.Let’s give Bhushan a 6.5x and say that the EV is 5000 x 6.5 = Rs 33,000 crore.At that point, debt is Rs 26,000 crore so the equity is valued at Rs 7,000 crore.Again, for 404 crore shares this is a price of Rs 17.5 per share.To justify a price of Rs 32 per share, you need an EV-EBIDTA of 7.5+. This is possible in a good market (however, most steel companies are trading below those valuations today).The Verdict: Much Better Outcome Than EarlierThis is an interesting outcome, because Tata Steel chose to convert at Rs 30 per share. At some level, this provides a valuation base to the company. Of course, at current relative valuations, the price is still way too high (we estimate that if it were valued as per its peers, the share should be below Rs 20 per share).But still, there are questions – all these valuation estimates assume conversion. If Tata Steel does convert they could quickly force a delisting of the company, since they will have more than 90 percent. And then, shareholders may not be able to exit in any meaningful way.We expect that the Tata’s will play nice here – and either merge the company with Tata Steel, at a possible conversion price closer to Rs 30 per share (effectively) after conversion. Eventually, of course, the future will depend on the performance of Tata Steel. That performance hasn’t been all that great, even with a steel upcycle. A return of capex planning in the economy would do it a lot of good, so the real verdict will have to be after the budget later this year.For Bhushan Steel (Now Tata Steel BSL) shareholders, this conversion must be a sigh of relief, because it provides clarity on exactly what the minority shareholders will own in this business.The author is Founder and CEO of Capitalmind. "

title,Fine Organics: A play on the regulated and high margin segments of oleochemicals
datetime,2019-04-04 09:25:00+00:00
description,None
content,"NoneNoneOleochemicals — chemicals derived from plant origins — have gained usage in varied consumer-facing businesses over the years. We look at two listed companies in this market, operating in niche segments, where entry barriers are high and the end-use demand is strong, and decode which ones investors should be looking at.While the global market size of oleochemicals, estimated at $25.9 billion, is a tiny subset of the $4.5 trillion global market for chemicals, it is expected to grow in double-digits in the medium term. A key driving force is need for environmental friendly alternatives to petrochemicals. Further, research has helped in expanding applications across industries.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAbout three-fourth of Fine Organics’s revenue comes from plastic additives which are used to improve various functional and processing properties for the plastic, packaging and petrochemical industries. The rest comes from food additives (emulsifiers, preservatives) and other end-user markets such as personal care and feed nutrition. Some of the large global companies in FMCG and plastic processing are its clients.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneIn case of Galaxy, feedstock is derived from palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil. Of this, lauryl alcohol, which is derived from palm kernel, requires special mention as it is imported from southeast Asia. Overall, this makes prices of palm oil and changes in import duties the key variables to monitor for this segment.NoneNoneNoneIn case of Galaxy, we take account of company’s dominant market share in surfactants industry but are equally wary of increasing competitive intensity as local players -- AR Surfactants and Khurana Oleo Chemicals -- emerge. While Galaxy’s stock has corrected by 33 percent from the 52 week high, valuation still appears elevated given the slowdown in Middle East/Turkey region (around 35-40 percent of sales) and limited pricing power. Hence, investors can wait for better entry levels.For Fine Organics, though the valuation multiple appears high, we believe it reflects its exposure to higher margin segments of oleochemicals businesses. Expansion plans suggests more than 25 percent earnings CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in the medium term. A stronger balance sheet makes it an accumulation candidate in our opinion.Follow @anubhavsaysNone"

description,A look at how the southern Indian states voted in the 2014 Lok Sabha election
content,"NonePrime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to retain power along with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners. They are being challenged by the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and other Opposition parties.Multiple opinion surveys have predicted the possibility of a hung Parliament. They also predict that the BJP, which nearly swept northern India in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, will face heavy losses there. Therefore, to offset those losses, the saffron party is trying to make inroads into eastern, north-eastern and southern India.Here’s a look at how the southern states voted in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls:KarnatakaThis is the only state in southern India where the BJP enjoys significant support and has a robust organisation. Ahead of the general election, former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa returned to the BJP fold and merged his party. This significantly propelled the party’s performance, winning 17 out of the state’s 28 seats.The Congress came second with nine seats while the Janata Dal (Secular) won two.In terms of vote share, the BJP was placed first (43.37 percent), then Congress (41.15 percent) and followed by JD(S) (11.07 percent).NoneKeralaThe Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) got the better of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala. The UDF won 12 out of the state’s 20 seats: Congress (eight), Indian Union Muslim League (two), Kerala Congress (Mani) (one) and Revolutionary Socialist Party (one).The LDF won the remaining eight: Communist Party of India (Marxist) (five), Communist Party of India (one) and two Independents that it had supported.The UDF and the LDF had a vote share of around 40.7 percent and 38.4 percent, respectively.NoneNoneTelanganaThe state headed into polls, ahead of its official bifurcation from Andhra Pradesh, to elect its first Assembly and its first set of 17 Lok Sabha Members of Parliament (MP).The bifurcation clearly had its effect on the election which saw 11 members of the pro-bifurcation Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) get elected.The Congress managed to win two seats in the state. The BJP and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) were fighting in an alliance and managed to win one seat each in the state.YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress Party won one seat while All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM)’s Asaduddin Owaisi retained the family bastion of Hyderabad.NoneAndhra PradeshThe TDP-BJP alliance won 17 out of the 25 seats in the state heading for bifurcation. The YSRCP picked up the remaining eight seats.The Congress, which had won 33 out of the 42 seats in the outgoing Lok Sabha, failed to win any seats. Political observers suggest this was because of the decision to grant statehood to Telangana.NoneTamil NaduThe state was swept by J Jayalalithaa-led All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The party won 37 out of the state’s 39 seats. This meant that its rival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) failed to win a single seat in the Lower House of Parliament.The BJP won the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat while its ally Paattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) won the Dharmapuri seat.The AIADMK secured 44.9 percent of the votes in the state. Despite not winning a seat, DMK’s secured 23.9 percent of the votes. The BJP and the PMK got 5.5 and 4.4 percent of the votes, respectively.NoneUnion TerritoriesThere are three Union Territories in southern India — Lakshadweep, Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar. All three territories have one Lok Sabha constituency each.In 2014, the Lakshadweep seat was won by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)’s Mohammed Faizal, securing 50.2 percent of the votes. Congress’ Muhammed Hamdulla Sayeed finished second with 46.6 percent of the votes.The lone Puducherry seat was won by All India NR Congress with a 35.6 percent vote share. The All India NR Congress was and remains part of the NDA."

Senior officer from PMO held a meeting with DoT, finance ministry and Niti Aayog in which it has been decided that DoT will submit a detailed roadmap at the earliest to concerned authorities for the revival of MTNL and BSNL,"" the source told PTI.Both the companies have also sought spectrum for 4G services through equity infusion from the government.BSNL, which has the lowest debt of Rs 14,000 crore among all telecom operators, has sought 4G spectrum across India through equity infusion of Rs 7,000 crore. The total spectrum will cost the firm Rs 14,000 crore.The PSUs have been also ailing because of high revenue-to-debt ratio due to a high number of government employees that were transferred by the Department of Telecom to them at the time of their formation. BSNL has 1.76 lakh employees across India and MTNL has 22,000 employees.MTNL has sought a refund of interest that it paid for broadband wireless access spectrum which it was given by the government and asked to pay the price that was determined in auctions held in 2010.Both state-run telecom firms have asked for permissions to monetise their land assets as well as the voluntary retirement scheme for employees on the Gujarat model. Under the Gujarat model, an amount equivalent to 35 days of salary for each completed year of service, and 25 days of salary for each year of service left till retirement is offered.The VRS scheme for BSNL and MTNL will have a revenue impact of Rs 6,365 crore and Rs 2,120 crore respectively.The revenue-to-wage ratio in case of MTNL has swelled to 90 per cent while in the case of BSNL it is around 60-70 per cent. The DoT has recommended that VRS of both PSUs should be funded through a 10-year bond issue and the bonds should be paid back by lease revenue that they will get from land asset monetisation."

description,The investment in the furniture brand called Forma will be approximately Rs 250 crore over the next five years.
content,"NoneJSW Living, a part of the business conglomerate JSW that has ventured into the steel furniture business is eyeing a revenue of Rs 250 crore over the next two years, said Tarini Jindal Handa, Managing Director, JSW Living.In an interview to Moneycontrol, Handa said, “We are going to be EBITDA positive by the end of this year (FY20) and the second year we will be profitable. We will reinvest the profit into our business since we are asset light.”The investment in the furniture brand called Forma will be approximately Rs 250 crore over the next five years.Initially, the company plans to launch the steel furniture in southern India and will tap the rest of the country next year.The company’s products which start from Rs 19,000 are available at 62 outlets.The furniture market in India is estimated to be Rs 1.32 lakh crore and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 11 percent over the last five years.She said the organised sector accounts for about 16 percent of the entire furniture market and is extremely fragmented with over 50 key players.The company also plans to come up with a buyback program in future for recycling and reuse of products.Edited excerpts:Q: What motivated you to enter the furniture segment?A: Usage of colour is very important to me. India as a nation has been very colourful. We are a vibrant country and I feel our homes are losing vibrancy. We are only buying the plastic, the beige, wood colour, the black, white, the grey. As a nation, we like bright colours and that was a huge motivation for me to do the furniture business and to inject colour.Q: What is the size of the market currently in India and what is the extent of the market you would be capturing over the next two years?A: The growth rate of the market is at 11 percent annually and it’s a huge market with an organised segment of only 16 percent. On capturing the market, I would not be able to give you the correct statistics. So far, we just want to enter and see. The market is enormous. We are looking forward to our journey.Q: Since you have an asset- light model you have got two manufacturers on board to manufacture the furniture. Will you be setting up your own manufacturing unit or continue with contract manufacturers?A: As long as we can, we want to be asset light and we would like to use the existing capacity of India. We will be investing in R&D, in newer processes but we would not like to manufacture initially. In future, if we feel we will start our own manufacturing unit.Q: Since this is a consumer-facing business, can you tell us how many retail touch points will you be having and how many cities will you be venturing in to?A: Today, we are already present in 62 outlets across Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana. We plan to enter Kerala, Tamilnadu, and Southern part of India in the next few months.Q: What is your distribution strategy?A: We work on a distribution network where we contact distributors who have their own retail network. By 2023 we plan to open our own retail stores, experience centres.Q: Would you be looking at the online space for selling the furniture?A: We are already available online.Q: There is a lot of competition in this space. What is your strategy to beat the competition?A: More the competition the better for us.  It will only make us work harder and bring more innovative designs. The advantage that we have at JSW is that we are manufacturing within India where we are producing our own steel and we are going and spending time with our consumers and we are understanding their wants their needs, their desires. We are open to collaborations, we want to bring good designs.Q: What are your revenue projections for this business?A: We are going to be EBITDA positive by the end of this year (FY20) and the second year we will be profitable. We will reinvest the profit into our business since we are asset light. Also, because we will need money for R&D. Our expected revenue will be Rs 250 crore over the next two years."

title,Know Your Leader | Nitish Kumar: Bihar's 'vikas purush' and a serial 'flip-flopper'

description,"Nitish earned accolades for the work he did in Bihar and by early 2013, it had become clear that Narendra Modi and Nitish were the two strongest possible candidates for the NDA for the 2014 Lok Sabha election"
content,"Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar is leading the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA)’s charge in Bihar.The 68-year-old managed to broker a good deal for his party, convincing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to fight 17 out of the state’s 40 seats, each. The BJP willing to contest 17 seats — five less than what it had won in 2014 — is being seen by political observes as a climbdown.This, some suggest, showed how important Nitish and his party were for BJP’s prospects there.Born in March 1951 in Bihar’s Bakhtiarpur to ayurvedic practitioner Ram Lakhan Singh and Parmeshwari Devi, Nitish earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Bihar College of Engineering before joining the Bihar State Electricity Board. He married Manju Kumari Sinha in 1973.Soon, he quit his job and joined politics.The political journeyBelonging to the socialist class of politicians, Nitish was an active member of the Jayaprakash Narayan movement between 1974 and 1977. During this time, he also became close to Bihar's eventual chief minister Satyendra Narayan Sinha.In 1994, Nitish and George Fernandes came together to form the Samta Party. Their alliance with the BJP in the 1996 and 1998 Lok Sabha elections yielded good results and established Nitish as a leader.In 1998-99, Nitish served as the Union Minister for Railways and Minister for Surface Transport and later as the Minister for Agriculture in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.In 2000, Nitish became the chief minister of Bihar for the first time. However, his government lasted only eight days.His party merged with Janata Dal (United) in 2003, which was also part of the NDA.He returned as the railway minister in 2001, a position he served until the term ended in 2004.NoneHe became the Bihar chief minister after JD(U) and BJP came to power in the state in 2005. The alliance convincingly won the 2010 election to retain power.Nitish got recognition for the work he did in Bihar and by early 2013, it had become clear that Narendra Modi and Nitish were the two strongest possible candidates for the NDA for the 2014 Lok Sabha election.In fact, he has been described by many as 'vikas purush (development man)'.‘Flip-flopper’Nitish has made several flip-flops in his career as a politician.With a strong anti-incumbency factor looming over the Congress-led alliance at the Centre, Nitish sensed that the 2014 Lok Sabha election would be perhaps the right opportunity for the top job in Delhi.His calculation was simple. If the BJP was unable to get a majority by itself, they would have to rely on JD(U)'s support and look at a more ""secular face"" for the prime ministerial position, thereby choosing him ahead of Modi.However, when Modi became the de facto prime ministerial candidate of the NDA, Nitish decided to pull-out of the alliance.The NDA got a thumping majority and Nitish's miscalculation was exposed. After winning just two seats (a loss of 18 seats from 2009), he was forced to take moral responsibility for the embarrassing loss and resign as chief minister. He was replaced by Jitan Ram Manjhi.But, less than a year later, he returned as the chief minister, rallying party members — in what can be called an ugly in-fight within the JD(U) — behind him after Manjhi refused to step aside.Fearing a wipe-out by the BJP, JD (U) tied up with the Congress and rival RJD.In what came as a surprise to many, the 'Grand Alliance' won the election convincingly. But, the relationship between the three alliance members has not been cordial.In April 2016, Lalu Prasad Yadav called Nitish the opposition's prime ministerial candidate for the 2019 Lok Sabha election, starting speculations about a grand alliance.In November 2016, he praised PM Modi for carrying out demonetisation. Again, in June that year, his party backed BJP's Ram Nath Kovind as the presidential candidate. He also refused to participate in a meeting to discuss the opposition's vice-presidential candidate.Finally, on July 26, 2017, Nitish resigned as the chief minister amid rift with the RJD over corruption charges against senior leaders of the party.Often referred to as the ‘Chanakya of Bihar’, Nitish readily accepted BJP's support to continue in power — a move that took him from being a staunch Modi critic to an ally."

The company could give the superbike a complete overhaul to abide by the new Euro5 rules.NoneNoneNoneIt is expected that the motorcycle will retain its Crossplane crankshaft engine but will borrow some components from its purebred racing cousin, the YZR-M1. Among these components is a counter-rotating crankshaft, which helps in the bike’s agility and handling. It also prevents wheelies under hard acceleration, diminishing the use of electronic aids.NoneThe motorcycle is also speculated to adopt variable valve timing, which is currently seen in Suzuki’s superbike, the GSX-R1000. BMW has also endowed the same technology in their S1000RR, under the name BMW ShiftCam.As per a set of patent files from Yamaha, the bike is also expected to get a seamless gearbox, which has been used only in MotoGP bikes till now. This gearbox allows the bike to have simultaneous gears engaged. This improves the acceleration by up to 7 percent as the gearbox does not cut power. It also allows the rider to shift at extreme lean angles without having to worry about destabilization.NoneThe company is also expected to give the R1 a complete redesign.

In 2014, the company forayed into the fast moving electrical goods (FMEG - fans, lighting and luminaire products, switchgears, switches and pumps) segment to leverage its existing brand as well as distribution channel.The company was established as Sind Electric Stores in 1964 by Thakurdas Jaisinghani and is currently promoted by the second as well as third generation of the Jaisinghani family (promoter group) who together hold around 79 percent stake in the company.After the IPO, stake of the promoter group will reduce to 69 percent. While the family holds majority stake, the company is professionally managed through key management personnel such as Ramakrishnan Ramamurthi (CEO), Gandharv Tongia (CFO) and Manoj Verma (COO).What are the key positives?NoneThe historic revenue growth of Polycab has been in-line with the industry and the same is expected to continue as the cables and wires market continues to expand on the back of government’s focus on power, infrastructure and housing. The company is also exploring export opportunities through strategic tie-ups in the international markets (US, Europe, Middle East and Africa).NoneNoneDespite being an asset heavy business model with in-house manufacturing, the company has generated healthy return ratios through prudent working capital management. Its return on capital stood at nearly 20 percent in FY18 and 9M FY19.NoneNoneIn 2016, the company entered into an equal joint venture with Trafigura (multinational commodity trading company) to set-up a 225,000 million tonne copper wire rod manufacturing facility in Waghodia (Vadodara). This plant is expected to commence operations from Q1 FY20 and will reduce Polycab’s dependency on copper sourcing from external parties.NoneNoneWhat are the key business risks?NoneNoneFMEG is a very crowded market with a large number of players present in each product category. Certain products such as lighting have witnessed a steep price erosion due to technology obsolescence and fever pitch competition. Other products such as switchgears and pumps have a high degree of correlation with new construction activity and monsoon, respectively.NoneNoneAs the company is operating at nearly 70 percent capacity utilisation, the timing of the IPO raises questions about the need for tapping funds through capital markets. Valuations are at a minor discount to its core peers (KEI and Finolex Cables) and offers value to prospective shareholders.NoneInvestors, be it short or long term, should look forward to subscribing to this IPO as its valuation should be at a premium to other listed players considering its market leadership position, sound fundamentals and healthy growth prospects.NoneFollow @Sach_PalNone"

They could have at the most given two seats to Ambedkar. His intransigence has led Congress leaders to believe that he is a puppet, swinging on the BJP’s strings, particularly as he has teamed up with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad Muslimeen (AIMIM), led by Asaduddin Owaisi. AIMIM has long been described and believed to be the flip side of the BJP.Owaisi experimented in October 2014 with putting up at least two dozen candidates out of the 288 seats in the Maharashtra assembly. Among these were a fair number of Dalits, though all of them lost. Only two Muslim candidates—one from Aurangabad and one in Mumbai—were successful. Owaisi is now extending that experiment, hoping an official alliance with Ambedkar’s broad-based front will help him gain a bigger footprint in Maharashtra.The experiment of Dalits and Muslims coming together is not new to Maharashtra. In the turbulent years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, former gangster-turned-politician Yusuf Patel had set up the Dalit-Muslim Suraksha Mahasangh, which fought several elections with little success. The party soon disappeared.In this election, though, Dalit-Muslim unity is crucial to all mainstream parties. These are sections that are sorely disappointed with the ruling BJP, having been subjected to various atrocities including lynching, both in Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country. They are unlikely to vote for the Shiv Sena-BJP combine and the BJP is hoping that the VBA-AIMIM alliance will split their vote, and draw it away from the Congress.Ambedkar’s decision to contest from Solapur which, by and large, has not been on his radar over the years, is lending credence to the feeling among Congress leaders that he is only out to defeat former Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde. That could be sweet revenge for the BJP, which utterly dislikes Shinde for having coined the term ‘saffron terrorism’ when he was union home minister.Ambedkar is, however, also contesting from his old seat of Akola where there is a large Dalit and Muslim population. However, in 2014, he came third behind even the Congress candidate in that constituency who was a Muslim. The Congress is thus repeating Hidayat Patel. The BJP is represented by Sanjay Dhotre, its three-time MP, in the hope that their offer of reservation to Marathas will neutralise the Dalit-Muslim vote bank in favour of their candidate (Dhotre is Maratha).On the other hand, Ambedkar is hoping that his alliance with AIMIM will bring him substantial minority votes. But there can be no cast-iron guarantees. The Congress-NCP alliance is pretty convinced that the two communities will vote tactically in their favour—in normal times Ambedkar needed a leg up from the Congress to win even in Akola. Also, Muslims today are less enamoured of the Owaisi brothers than they were five years ago.Although Ambedkar now describes the Congress as ‘Manuwadi’ after seeking its support for a bandh following the Bhima-Koregaon riots in January 2018 and says that he aims to defeat the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance, the VBA and AIMIM are likely to cut into the Congress-NCP votes without accruing much gains to themselves despite fielding candidates all across Maharashtra.Whether this experiment falls by the wayside like Patel's Dalit Muslim Suraksha Mahasangh or it cuts a new pathway in Indian politics will be keenly watched."

description,Companies try various scare tactics to stop employees from joining rival firms 
content,"April is when most of us get our yearly appraisals and performance incentives. It is also the time when companies try scare tactics with employees who have planned to quit. Employees could be denied the relieving letter, sudden anti-competition clause added into employment contracts or last dates could be extended.Pragya Gupta, an IT-sector employee, did not sign any contract that said that she wasn’t allowed to work in a competing firm. At the time of resignation, she was told that the company had added a clause for all employees that would prohibit them from working with competitors for six months after quitting.On the other hand, several banks have a clause called ‘gardening leave’ that is a tactic used to delay a candidate’s joining date in their future organisation. This a paid leave by the company during which an employee is still contractually part of the organisation, but is not required to come to office. This prevents these individuals from joining rival organisations.Similarly, the extension of the notice period is a common tactic used by companies to try and delay the joining date of candidates in the future organisation. There are also multiple such cases of companies withdrawing job offers if the candidate is unable to join at a short notice.The idea is simple. Whatever is not in your individual employment contract is not legal. So, if your employer has changed their policy in the notice period after you joined, this is applicable to you contractually. Any such deviation in policies can be questioned in the court of law.Estimates suggest that 60-65 percent of candidates who quit companies do so after being dissatisfied with the appraisals or performance incentives. One of the most common techniques used by companies to try and retain candidates is to offer unreasonable promises.Kanika Kaul’s employer promised to offer her a 40 percent hike against the 35 percent offered by a rival organisation. She fell for their word and decided to take back her resignation. However, the manufacturing sector company backtracked on the promise citing ‘budget constraints’.Nevertheless, the fault lies with the employees too. Getting a counter offer merely to get a better salary hike or to get the compensation ‘matched’ with that of a rival organisation has been a common trend. Now, there are also reports of employees presenting fake letters to get an increase in pay. If found, a disciplinary action could also be taken against such employees."

title,"Gracing Gucci bags and Apple headphones, here's why Mickey Mouse continues to be Disney's best salesman"
datetime,2019-04-06 08:13:00+00:00
description,The character has evolved over the years to increase likeability.
content,"With his red pants, white gloves and funny antiques, Mickey Mouse has entertained and brought joy to many generations since his first appearance in 1928. He is also quite the cash cow for its parent company.NoneAnd, it is not toys that are targeted towards children that is raking in the dollars.The report noted that Gucci has launched a bag shaped like Mickey’s head to the tune of $4500, with the “Gucci” logo embossed across the handle validating the steep price tag. Makeup lines such as L’Oréal and Maybelline are selling products using Mickey’s image. Even Apple released a limited-edition set of Beats headphones, priced at $300, with an early rendition of Mickey Mouse printed across it.The report noted that the Walt Disney Company and several others that make products with his image release these products by banking on anniversaries to boost their sales.This was the case in 2004 when it earned $6 billion on the 75th anniversary year of Mickey’s first appearance.The report also quoted a market research carried out in the United States, which showed a 97 percent name recall. That is even higher than Santa Claus. This was mainly propelled by the licensing of Mickey’s image to thousands of other companies. The report noted that the endearing success of the mouse across many generations was the careful curation of the mouse’s image by the Walt Disney Company.Mickey evolved as a mouse-like, or rat-like, creature prone to smoking, drinking and even inappropriate behavior. Over the years, he was rendered with softer-looking features, larger eyes, a friendly demeanor that was appealing to children, and family-friendly behavior.Harvard evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould termed the effect“neoteny,” which was the retention of juvenile features in adult animals. The report further quoted Gould saying that scientists had observed a link between the eyes of adults and their lingering on child-like faces and babies, which could also subconsciously bring about a greater level of attachment.According to the report, this was a conscious design call taken be Disney to enhance the likeability of all their characters.The report quoted Garry Apgar, a Yale-educated art historian and an expert on cultural representations of Mickey Mouse. He said that Mickey-related merchandise was initially relegated to children’s toys, which included stuffed toys, trains, and nursery wallpaper.Within five years, Disney was bringing in $1 million a year in merchandise sales, equivalent to $19 million in 2019 dollars.The report quoted the New York Times saying that Mickey’s clout earned $100 million in merchandise for people of all ages in 1947. Almost 600,000 Mickey Mouse watches were sold in that year alone.In the process, Mickey became a ray of hope and warmth in bleak war conditions. It was when people were left disillusioned and morally shattered by the horrors of war. This could be seen by how Disney was contacted by an US air squadron to draw some Mickey Mouse cartoons in 1939 to maintain the morale of men.Mickey’s image was soon embedded into the machinery that kept up the war effort. Munitions factory workers wore Mickey Mouse buttons. He was printed on bond certificates that supported the US war loan drive and even on posters that drove war recruitment and warnings to catch early signs of an enemy attack.“Mickey Mouse” even became the password for American troops that landed on the Normandy beaches on D-Day. In this process, Disney effectively managed to erase Mickey’s past, which allowed flexibility for him to be placed in any context. This is the reason Agpar said that Mickey could be seen as a symbol of capitalism or even be used as an insult, depending on which side of the Communism ideology one supported.A “Mickey Mouse organization” or “Mickey Mouse degree” was seen as something that was frivolous and amateurish. The report further mentioned that Mickey’s image was so carefully licensed out that the battery of lawyers and its consumer products division discouraged potential licensees from using images of Mickey Mouse drinking and smoking in his earlier renditions."

title,Technical Classroom: How to identify profitable gaps on technical price chart
datetime,2019-04-06 08:51:00+00:00
description,"In an upward trend, a gap is produced when the highest price of one day is lower than the lowest price of the next day. Conversely, in a downward trend, a gap occurs when the lowest price of any one day is higher than the highest price of the next day."
content,"Shabbir KayyumiA gap is defined as an unfilled space or interval. Gaps result from extraordinary buying or selling interest developing while the market is closed. On a technical analysis chart, a gap represents an area where no trading has taken place.In Japanese Candlestick Charting gaps are referred to as windows. In an upward trend, a gap is produced when the highest price of one day is lower than the lowest price of the next day. Conversely, in a downward trend, a gap occurs when the lowest price of any one day is higher than the highest price of the next day.Gaps are blank spaces on a price charts representing incidence of no shares being traded within a particular price range. Gaps are common, especially in the stock market and they provide information and insights about the underlying market dynamics.None• When prices gap upwards, the gap can act as support to prices in the future.Gaps as Support and ResistanceTypes of GapsCommon GapsSometimes referred to as a trading gap or an area gap, the common gap is usually uneventful. These gaps are common and usually get filled fairly quickly. The price action at a later time (a few days to a few weeks) usually retraces at the least to the last day before the gap. This is also known as closing the gap.Breakaway GapsBreakaway gaps are the exciting ones. These occur when the price action is breaking out of a trading range or congestion area. To understand gaps, one has to understand the nature of congestion areas in the market. A congestion area is just a price range in which the market has traded for some period of time, usually a few weeks or so. The area near the top of the congestion area is usually resistance when approached from below. Likewise, the area near the bottom of the congestion area is support when approached from above. To break out of these areas requires market enthusiasm, and either many more buyers than sellers for upside breakouts or many more sellers than buyers for downside breakouts.NoneMeasuring GapsMeasuring gaps are best described as gaps caused by increased interest in the stock. Measuring gaps to the upside typically represent traders who did not get in during the initial move of the uptrend and, while waiting for a retracement in price, decided it was not going to happen. Increased buying interest happens all of a sudden, and the price gaps above the previous day's high. This type of runaway gap represents a near-panic state in traders. Also, a good uptrend can have runaway gaps caused by significant news events that cause new interest in the stock.Exhaustion GapsAs its name sounds, an exhaustion gap occurs at the end of a trend. In the case of an uptrend, price makes one last attempt to move higher on a last gasp of breath; however, the trend is exhausted, and the higher price cannot be sustained. It is easy to detect an exhaustion gap in hindsight; however, distinguishing an exhaustion gap from a measuring gap at the time of the gap can be difficult because the two share many characteristics.Conclusion• Gaps can offer evidence that something important change has happened to the fundamentals or the psychology of the crowd that accompanies this market movement. A correct interpretation of this change leads to profitable trading.The author is Head - Technical & Derivative Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors."

content,"One of the foremost tenets of creative writing is to ""Write what you know"". This is why Chetan Bhagat's novel on student life in IIT, Ravi Subramanian's investment banking thrillers and Upmanyu Chatterjee's novel on what is like to be a civil servant in India strike a chord with readers.NoneNoneNoneNoneMunia, a tribal woman, is also caught in a web of contradictions in this world. She is the lover of a Naxal commander but is also hired on wages to clean up government buildings. Like many other tribal citizens, she is subject to the greed and the debauchery of contractors and politicians on one hand and being stripped of her agency by the state on the other.Agarwal's telling descriptions of the rough life in these villages, the manner in which tribal society operates, and the tussle for power between the state and the Naxalities shed light on the fact that most of the tribal folk are always on the losing end.NoneThe novel could have packed a greater punch if Agarwal's lens as a government officer could have been channelled through the first person narrative of a police officer on the field. It would have felt more personal. The romance that was promised in the title of the novel is clunky, developing and resolving itself towards the fag end."

description,"Council to consider changes after Lok Sabha elections. Some states such as Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat wanted the price cap to be raised from Rs 45 lakhs, given property were costlier in these regions"
content,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) council may consider multiple price thresholds for defining `affordable housing’ across states rather than setting a uniform nation-wide classification. The move was aimed to better reflect prevailing property prices in different locations.Currently, a residential apartment with a carpet area of up to 90 square meters, in non-metropolitan cities and 60 square meteres, in case of metros priced at up to Rs 45 lakhs will be defined as affordable houses for purposes of GST calculations.Some states such as Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat wanted the price cap to be raised for house to qualify as `affordable’ in their states, given property were costlier in these regions.In the last GST Council meeting held on March 19 these states had raised the matter, but the issue could not be considered because the Model Code of Conduct was in place.The Council will have its next full-fledged meeting after the new government assumes office.“In the first meeting that will be held after the new government is formed, the Council might consider this matter,” a senior government official who did not wish to be identified told Moneycontrol. States might be allowed to fix the ceiling for taxability, the official said.The Maharashtra government wants the ceiling to be in the range of Rs 60-70 lakh or even Rs 75 lakh, especially in and around Mumbai. Gujarat is also learnt to have supported the suggestion. Some states have also asked for freedom to fix the ceiling instead of a uniform ceiling as the cost varies in different states. “All the options will be considered in the next meeting of the GST Council,” the official said.Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi NCR (limited to Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, Faridabad), Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai (the whole of Mumbai Metropolitan Region) are considered as metropolitan cities for purposes of GST calculations.In the last meeting held on February 24, 2019, the Council had lowered the GST rate to 1 percent from 8 percent for 'affordable houses' and to 5 percent from 12 percent for other houses, but without input tax credit (ITC) benefits.In the next meeting on March 19, the Council allowed builders to choose between higher rates with input tax credits (ITC) on raw material or lower duties without any such benefits for unfinished projects.The Council decided that builders can pick between paying 12 percent for non-affordable houses with ITC benefits or 5 percent without the tax rebates for under-construction houses.Likewise, for 'affordable housing projects', builders can choose between 8 percent with tax rebates or 1 percent without it. The new rates, without ITC benefits, will apply for all projects that begin construction only after April 1.Affordable housing presently has multiple definitions. In July 2014, the Reserve Bank of India had defined affordable housing loans as eligible under priority sector lending, as also housing loans to individuals up to Rs 50 lakh for houses of values up to Rs 65 lakh in the six metropolitan cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad and Rs 40 lakh for houses of values up to Rs 50 lakh in other centres for purchase/construction of dwelling unit per family."

description,"The actor-turned-politician, however, did remarkable on-ground work, using up 106% of his MPLAD funds"
content,"Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who will be joining the Congress soon, has had an illustrious career as a silver-screen performer, but the same may not hold true with regard to his stint as a Lok Sabha MP in the past five years.NoneHe had also not introduced a single private member's bill either; his attendance was poor too, to be precise, he was present on only 67 percent of days the Lower House was in session.As against this, the average attendance of other Members of Parliament was 81 percent in the same period of time.However, it was not always like this. Past records show that in the 15th Lok Sabha (2009-14), Sinha had asked some 67 questions and taken part in nine debates.One must note here that the two-time Lok Sabha MP from Patna Sahib has also served two terms as a Rajya Sabha MP, from 1996 to 2008. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was PM, he had served as the Union cabinet minister for health and family welfare for a year and Union minister for shipping for another.Asking questions in the House is one of the key ways MPs seek information from the government about the work done in their constituencies and the country. It is basically a tool to make the party in power be accountable for its work.This apart, it is also very important for MPs to participate in House debates since everything said by an MP makes it to Lok Sabha records. These are also referred to by MPs and the public later to gauge what MPs at a given point of time thought of an issue.On the contrary, Sinha judiciously utilised his MPLAD funds, the amount allocated to Members of Parliament for development of their areas/ constituencies. His on-ground records show he utilised 106.83 percent of the MPLAD funds released by the central government for his constituency, whereas the all-India utilisation percentage stands at 91.84 percent.Notably, he had grown more inclined towards the LK Advani camp within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the past five years. In fact, he has also openly attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah several times."

content,"The ruling Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh on April 6 released its manifesto for the general elections promising doles to the tune of Rs 2 lakh to each family every year, with the monetary benefits starting from womb to tomb.Releasing his party manifesto, TDP president and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said while Congress chief Rahul Gandhi promised Rs 72,000 per annum to each poor family, his government if voted back to power, would be giving out Rs 2 lakh to each family every year.""Nobody can match us in extending such largesse even in imagination,"" he said.The TDP promised to continue the Centre's PM Kisan Samman scheme with a matching grant from the state, giving a benefit of up to Rs 15,000 to each farmer per annum. The principal opposition YSR Congress party also released its manifesto, hours ahead of the TDP, matching the largesse in equal measure, if not more.The Assembly and Lok Sabha elections are being held simultaneously in Andhra Pradesh which goes to the polls in the first phase on April 11.While the TDPs promises include raising the limits of various existing schemes for different sections, the YSRC party added several new components to the Nava Ratnalu it announced on the eve of its president Y S Jaganmohan Reddys 'paada yatra' in November 2017.Officials estimated that the cash-starved state government will require at least Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore to fulfill the promises of either party.With the two parties promising 30-45 lakh free houses for different sections, besides waiver of existing loans on old houses, that bill alone is expected to cross over Rs 40,000 crore.Neither the TDP nor YSRC announced a farm loan waiver but promised several benefits to farmers in varied measures.The YSRC, on the other hand, promised to introduce the YSR Rythu Bharosa scheme that will give annual benefits from Rs 12,500 to Rs one lakh to each farmer.Tenant farmers would be given Rs 12,500, according to Jagan Mohan Reddy.The highlight of YSRC's promises is a health insurance scheme Aarogya Sri, first introduced by former Chief Minister, the late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, without any cap to ensure universal health coverage.The YSRC also announced a stipend of Rs 60,000 to junior lawyers, a first-of-its-kind incentive. Besides, a Rs 100 crore Lawyer Welfare Fund would also be created.While the YSRC chief promised to fill all 2.3 lakh existing vacant jobs in the state government, the Chief Minister merely said all vacancies would be filled, without specifying the number.Both, however, promised to take up recruitment drive every year to fill future vacancies in the government. Naidu promised to continue the Pasupu-Kumkuma scheme under which Rs 10,000 would be given to each member of women self-help groups (SHGs).The YSRC promised Rs 50,000 per annum to SHG women and also interest-free loans.The TDP promised free higher education and a Rs 25 lakh grant for overseas education while the YSRC promised total fee reimbursement and also an annual Rs 20,000 per student to cover food and accommodation expenses.Every woman would be given Rs 15,000 a year for sending her children to school.Another highlight of the YSRC manifesto is a grant of Rs 75,000 for each woman over the age of 45, belonging to the SC, ST, BC and minorities under 'YSR Cheyuta.'The opposition party also promised liquor prohibition, making it available only in five-star hotels.A Rs 3,000 crore price stabilization fund for the farm sector, Rs 4,000 crore Natural Calamity Fund and Rs 75,000 crore BC Welfare Fund are the other major promises of the YSRC."

description," Google Assistant arguably holds an advantage over its peers. Nonetheless, it does have some not-so-trivial chunks in its armour, and we are hopeful that Google will get these features on board sooner rather than later."
content,"The last few years have seen cut-throat competition emerging in the AI assistant segment, with tech bigwigs such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant all coming into the foray with their own take on virtual assistance.However, with the kind of footprint Android has on the current consumer market, Google Assistant arguably hold an advantage over its peers.Nonetheless, it does have some not-so-trivial chunks in its armour, and we are hopeful that Google will get these features on board sooner rather than later.NoneEarlier, the device stopped listening after a single chain of action was taken. Now, you can keep talking to Google Assistant, beyond a single response.However, the experience so far, has been a bit clunky. Google Assistant is able to follow up with a more factual chain of thought but lags when questioned on subjective things.For example, if you are visiting a new city, you can ask Google Assistant about some basic facts, but if you follow up with a question about fun things to do there, Google Assistant assistant is lost.On the other hand, you may be able to riff a few more responses while asking a more straightforward factual question like, ""When did India get its independence?""The way the user interacts with Google Assistant would change tremendously once Google is able to enhance this functionality.Also, more exchanges between the user and Google Assistant will mean more number of recordings of people’s voices, which can ultimately improve the assistant’s understanding of conversations.NoneFor instance, you can create a routine triggered by ""Goodnight Google"" which would enable Do Not Disturb on your phone, turn off the lights and launch actions that play sleep-inducing music.The idea behind routines is to not just give people the ability to do multiple tasks at once but to also make it a part of one's daily habits.Samsung introduced Bixby Routines last month, which tracks users interaction with smartphones and proactively makes suggestions about things to do.Hence, if these suggestions were extended to Google Assistant Routines, it would help make people aware of what’s possible, even if they chose not to add the suggested routine.NoneHowever, there is a way you can send messages with Home speakers today. The Broadcast feature on Google Assistant lets you send text messages to people in your household, which is not nearly the same as the ability to send text messages via home speakers.We hope that Google brings this functionality to home speakers in the near future so you can stay connected to a wider circle of people that matter to you.NoneCurrently, in resting mode, Google Assistant's smart displays act as a digital photo frame. If Google could implement functionalities such as calendar, routine on the default page, it would change the way people interact with Google Assistant.Little things like proactive reminders of when you have your next meeting or at what time the store you plan to visit closes can help you fast track certain tasks.Maybe launch a Friday Night Mode, while they are at it?NoneWith Google Fit, it already provides historical data of one's footsteps, heart rate, and sleep cycles. Even Google Maps stores locations which you visit."

title,Technical Classroom | Leading indicators: RSI and MACD

description,The relative strength index is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.
content,"Chandan TapariaIn technical analysis there are two types of indicators i.e. leading and lagging indicators.In leading indicators, we will be discussing more about Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which are useful for chart analysis.Looking at leading indicators in conjunction with other types of data can help provide information about the future direction of the stock or index.a) Relative Strength Index (RSI):The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI is that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price.An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.Noneb) Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the ""signal line,"" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell - or short - the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line.None(The author is Derivatives & Technical Analyst at Motilal Oswal)"

title,How to set up a systematic withdrawal plan
datetime,2019-04-07 08:10:00+00:00
description,An appropriate withdrawal rate will ensure the corpus last a lot longer. It is observed that the higher the withdrawal rate the faster the depletion of capital.
content,"Gaurab ParijaWhat is an SWP? How does it work?Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) is a strategy where an investor withdraws a particular amount on a regular basis.An investor has to set up an SWP and can structure their withdrawal schedule monthly, quarterly, half yearly and annually. SWP can be structured with fixed amount or capital appreciation amount. The investor can setup the withdrawal amount and duration as per their convenience.SWP can be typically used for investors who need a regular cash flow. It works best for investors who have a fixed corpus and want to harvest returns from this at a fixed periodic interval. It enables regular income every month, quarter etc.NoneThe investor invests a lumpsum amount via his bank account in a selected mutual fund and does a SWP. The investor can choose to withdraw a fixed amount or only the capital appreciation amount.Withdrawal rateWhen an investor decides to start an SWP, they can decide to withdraw a fixed amount which has been calculated taking into account their monthly requirements or by considering a withdrawal rate.A safe withdrawal rate is supposed to be the amount you can spend each year without ever worrying about running out of money in the time period.Given a fixed withdrawal rate as a percentage of the invested assets an investor can back calculate an initial investment amount basis the cash flow needed per month.In the calculations below we have assumed an investment in the Sensex and thereafter used back tested scenarios assuming various market conditions and incorporated past volatilities to derive appropriate withdrawal rates and survival time periods.NoneIn the chart above we have considered an investment amount of Rs 1 crore and considered various withdrawal rates per month and plotted whether the capital will last for 10 years (120 months).The maximum, minimum and average time period in the number of months show that of an average period taken for the capital to go to zero. The table below enumerates the same.NoneSWP across the cyclesNoneThe graph above shows an illustration of the terminal value of an investment of Rs 1 crore, and a SWP of Rs 2 lakh every month i.e. a two percent monthly withdrawal rate.The illustration tries to cover various market cycles by considering different starting points, if started at the beginning of a Calendar year. We have selected a few years, to show these variations.We can observe from the graph above, if one would have started a SWP in 2003, the capital of Rs 1 crore would have lasted for more than 120 months , that is 10 years. Similarly, if the investment was made in 2008, the capital would have been fully consumed in 35 months.Starting an SWP at the peak of a bull market reduces the corpus at a faster rate and the corpus is depleted early. While starting a SWP in the bear market ensures the corpus lasts longer.Monthly withdrawal ratesNoneWe now consider two extreme scenarios starting an SWP in 2003, and starting an SWP in 2008, which are the best and the worst times using various monthly withdrawal rates ranging from 1 percent to 3 percent.By observing the graph of 2003, a 1 percent, 1.5 percent and 2 percent, the monthly withdrawal rate will allow the capital will endure past 120 months. However for a higher per month withdrawal rate of 2.5  percent and 3  percent, the investor capital will be depleted by the 98th and 69th month respectively. The table below enumerates the same for different years.NoneWithdrawal RateNoneAbove given graph is of CY 2008. 2008 being a year of downturn for equity markets, we observe that the invested capital of Rs 1 crore is completely depleted within 10 years albeit at different time periods at a 1 percent monthly withdrawal rate in 30 months, 1.5 percent  in 50 months, 2 percent in 35 months, 2.5 in 27 months and 3 percent in 21 months.An appropriate withdrawal rate will ensure the corpus last a lot longer. It is observed that the higher the withdrawal rate the faster the depletion of capital.Starting an SWP at the right time has a high impact on survival of the corpus. To ensure the corpus last longer we can also use the capital appreciation of SWP.(The author is Head of Sales & Marketing at IDFC AMC.)"

title,"Luka Chuppi, Badla join 10 movies that just fell short of entering 100 Crore Club"
datetime,2019-04-06 21:07:00+00:00
description,"2019 has seen three films which released in the first quarter of the year and though they all exceeded expectations, a century run evaded them."
content,"Joginder TutejaAsk a cricketer and he would tell that losing out on a century is one of the most painful experiences, especially if you have entered the 90s. This could well be the sentiment shared by Bollywood actors as well with a handful of films not quite reaching the 100 Crore Club. Though at last count as many as 76 films have hit a century ever since Ghajini opened the 100 Crore Club, there are just 10 films that have fell short by just a few crore.Incidentally, 2019 itself has seen three such films which released in the first quarter of the year and though they all exceeded expectations, a century run evaded them.Welcome Back - 97 croreWelcome Back holds the record for coming closest to this milestone and stopping short just in the final lap. Anees Bazmee's sequel to his superhit film Welcome was well received by the audiences. The multi-starrer with John Abraham leading the pack along with Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar brought in good laughs as well as good moolah but missed a century by 3 crore.Baby - 95.50 croreOne of the rare Akshay Kumar starrers in the recent times which fell in the 90s, Baby was a Neeraj Pandey directed spy thriller which is being hailed as a classic today. A very well made film with very good production values, this one was big screen entertainment at its best. However, it wasn't an out and out massy film due to which it fell just a little short at the single screens.Luka Chuppi - 93-94 crore (expected)Kartik Aaryan could well have scored back to back centuries here with Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety being his last 100 Crore Club Blockbuster. On the other hand Kriti Sanon too was coming from the success of Bareilly Ki Barfi. If not for Total Dhamaal on one side and Badla along with Captain Marvel on the other with cricket matches in between, this one was a century material.Raajneeti - 93.66 croreIf one accounts for inflation during the period gone by then this one was a big 100 Crore Club film by all means. However, in absolute terms Raajneeti fell just short. A multi-starrer of epic proportions with Ajay Devgn, Ranbir Kapoor, Katrina Kaif and Arjun Rampal in lead roles, this Prakash Jha directed film stays on to be the biggest grosser ever for a story set in politics.Manikarnika - The Queen of Jhansi - 92.19 croreKangana Ranaut battled difficulties and controversies but ultimately emerged victorious with Manikarnika - The Queen of Jhansi finding good audiences for itself. Though there were a few detractors from within the industry itself, the film ultimately managed to do good business. It couldn't really go past the 100 crore mark but success for the film is a win in itself.Talaash - 91 croreAn offbeat film starring Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Rani Mukherji, the film took some time to reach the finishing lines. There were talks about the film being reshot but ultimately when it released, the Reema Kagti directed affair worked with the urban audiences. Of course Aamir was used to delivering much bigger successes by then and Talaash fell short.Zero - 90.28 croreThis was a film that was touted to be a 200 crore entertainer in the offering. After all, Shah Rukh Khan was uniting with Aanand L. Rai of Tanu Weds Manu Returns fame and there were top leading ladies in the form of Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. However, the film failed commercially and couldn't even manage to score a century. Ultimately, a disappointing result for all.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara - 90.27 croreThis was yet another film which could well be a 100 Crore Club entrant today, given the inflation and increased ticket prices. However, back then this Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar, Katrina Kaif and Abhay Deol starrer fell just short of the 100 Crore Club mark. A niche film which was aiming for the core urban multiplex audience, it has managed a good recall value for it today.Singh Is Blinng - 90 croreJust like Baby, Akshay Kumar missed a century with Singh Is Blinng as well which was second in the franchise of Singh Is Kinng. This time around, Prabhu Dheva was at the director's chair. The film couldn't see much critical appreciation going for it and audiences too didn't quite root for it much after the opening. As a result, the film did cover some distance but that's it.Badla - 88-90 crore (expected)"

description,"Encouraged by the success of the KTM 125 Duke, it seems the company is now prepping its faired sibling, the RC 125."
content,"The KTM 390 Adventure has been in the works for a long time and images of test mules have been doing the rounds, but we are yet to hear an official announcement. The same goes with the 790 Duke. While it has been launched internationally, we are still waiting for its debut in India.NoneThe RC 125, as KTM tradition goes, will be the faired version of the 125 Duke and as such will use all of the cycle parts from the baby Duke. What changes though are the riding dynamics and aesthetics of the bike. Of course, the RC line of bikes are more track focused motorcycles and with that, they receive clip-on handlebars, a fairing for better aerodynamics, more rear-set footpegs, etc.The engine will be the same 124.7cc liquid-cooled single cylinder that produces a brilliant 14.5 PS power and 12 Nm of torque. These figures are almost on par with most 150cc bikes currently in India. Other parts too, like the WP front suspension and 10-step preload adjustable rear monoshock, will come from the 125 Duke.In terms of appearances, the RC 125 will look identical to the RC 200, but a differentiating paint scheme will be present. For example, the spy images reveal an orange pain for the tank unlike the RC 200."

title,Algo trading: Here are five steps to set up your own algorithm
datetime,2019-04-08 11:23:00+00:00
description,The data collected has to be processed step by step with some rules or conditions. The conditions can be as simple as two moving averages crossovers or it can be extremely complex.
content,"Sovit ManjaniThe dictionary definition of 'algorithm' is: A precise step-by-step plan for a computational procedure that possibly begins with an input value and yields an output value in a finite number of steps. Let’s break it into parts now.Data collection phase:Firstly, the system needs to have input. This can be anything from technical data like prices of stocks, commodities, indices, volume, option price, open interest, etc. or fundamental data like PE ratios, ROCE, Book Value, OPM, etc.The data can also be news, special situations, inflation numbers, GDP numbers, interest rates, etc. The data is the key for any algorithm, and utmost care is to be taken to collect the data and clean it.If the data is incorrect then the results cannot be relied upon. In the computing world, it’s called garbage in and garbage out. The data has to be stored in a structured manner so that it can be retrieved as and when required.This data can be sliced to in-sample data and out-of-sample data. The in-sample data means the data on which the rules are run and optimised. Out-of-sample data is the data that is unseen. The strategy once finalised is to be tested on this data for authenticity and confirmation.Development phase:The data collected has to be processed step by step with some rules or conditions. The conditions can be as simple as two moving averages crossovers or it can be extremely complex.To create a viable system there has to be a hypothesis or in simple words, an idea. This idea has to be explained to the computer by a language. There are many computer languages which can be used but the most popular ones are Python, C++, Java, Julia, R and Amibroker Formula language.Language selection depends on coder’s comfort, frequency of trades, acceptable latency, database size, etc. The back-test results are the output of the algorithm.Care has to be taken for not adding unnecessary rules. Simple strategy with lesser and simple rules is much more robust than a complex strategy with too many conditions.Optimisation phase:After coding the idea, the system may or may not produce desirable risk-adjusted returns on the in-sample data. The strategy may be optimised by adding or removing certain rules.If after multiple attempts, the strategy does not give decent results then the idea needs to be scrapped. The results may be optimised by changing some parameters. Care has to be taken as there is a danger of over-optimisation or curve fitting.Testing or validation phase:If the strategy looks decent then it is tested on the out-of-sample data. By decent result, one may assume a reward to risk ratio of at least 1.8 to 1.The returns should beat the buy on hold returns and the max drawdown should not be more than 35 percent. These metrics are subjective depending on the nature of the strategy and the psychological ability of the executor.Execution phase:Only if the strategy survives in the out-of-sample data then it can be tested for execution. The strategy is then connected to the API of a broker for auto execution.At this stage, some of the mistakes of system traders can be highlighted like wrong assumption of brokerages and slippage, liquidity, coding errors related to signal time and execution time.The execution part has to be tested toughly with small order size like 1 share per signal for at least a month. Now your system is ready to be deployed on real money.The author is Co-Founder, Head of Trading Strategies at Dravyaniti Consulting LLP."
