content,"Days after he was sworn-in as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, NCP's Ajit Pawar on November 26 tendered his resignation from the post, news reports suggested.The resignation comes an hour before Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is slated to address a press conference.Reports had earlier suggested that a battery of NCP leaders had held meetings with Pawar to convince him to come back to the party fold after he was sworn in as the Deputy CM in a hush-hush ceremony on November 23.The Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government took charge in Maharashtra on November 23 after the President's rule, imposed in the state about a fortnight ago, was revoked at 5.47 am.Fadnavis and Pawar took oath as the chief minister and deputy chief minister of Maharashtra after the President's rule was revoked.Reacting to development, senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Pawar has resigned and that he is ""with us"".Congress spokesperson and Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee member, Sachin Sawant, told Moneycontrol that the resignation has ""proved how unethical a party BJP is"".""This government is not in majority, which has been proved now after the resignation of Ajit Pawar. Now it is proved how unethical a party BJP is. That party can go to any lengths to grab power and that has been revealed in front of the people now,"" Sawant said.""They (BJP) wanted to grab power through unethical means in the dark of the night. They grabbed power by any means. But the way they grabbed power, in hush hush manner, they have to leave it now in the same manner. We demand that the CM should resign now,"" Sawant added.Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court of India (SC) ordered a floor test for Fadnavis on November 27 to prove his majority in the House, saying there is a ""possibility of horse trading"" in case of delay.As a month has elapsed after the declaration of results of the Assembly elections it is ""incumbent upon the court to protect the democratic values"" for which ""immediate floor test"" is the ""most effective mechanism"" to curtail unlawful practices such as horse trading as well as to avoid uncertainty and to effectuate smooth running of democracy by ensuring a stable Government,"" the apex court said.The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, which claimed that it had the numbers, had been asking for Fadnavis' resignation stating that his government does not have the numbers."

So after the 2007 (T20) World Cup, we came back to India and had an open bus ride and we were standing at the Marine Drive (in Mumbai). It was jam-packed all around and people had come out of their cars,"" said Dhoni.""So, I felt good after seeing the smile on everyone's face. Because, there could have been so many people in the crowd, who might have missed their flights, perhaps they were going for important work. The kind of reception, we got, the entire Marine Drive was full from one end to other.""The other moment which he listed was the chants of ""Vande Mataram"" by the fans when India was close to victory in the 2011 World Cup final here. Dhoni had remained unbeaten on 91 in the all-important game.""And the second instance I would say the 2011 World Cup final, in that match when 15-20 runs were required, the way all the spectators started chanting ‘Vande Mataram' at the Wankhede Stadium.""These are two moments, I think, it will be very difficult to replicate them. Those are the two moments that are very close to my heart,"" added Dhoni, whose future is an intense subject of speculation as he is not played since India's World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand in July.Dhoni said that the uncertainties of cricket made it the most followed sport in the country.""There are lot of uncertainties when it comes to cricket, and that's why I feel it is one of the most followed sport in India. Every delivery and every time the bowler comes, it changes the game. I feel, in the T20 every delivery actually changes the game,"" said Dhoni from the stage.""In cricket, we keep innovating ourself, we keep coming up with new things, something like a reverse-sweep was not part of the armoury if you talk about 15 years back, but now you see the batsmen turning around and playing the reverse-sweep. And the same thing I can say is that the Indian cricket team is successful because of the fans.""Dhoni also spoke about his early career, saying there were ups and downs.""I came from a small state (Jharkhand), from a small city (Ranchi), so it was not always up for me. It was those small ups and downs throughout till I went for my 2003 India A tour and from that point I have got steady success."

title,Dell G3 15 review: Is this the best entry-level gaming laptop?
datetime,2019-12-18 11:52:00+00:00
description,What Dell is offering in the new G3 is an overall package that may not be worth every penny in terms of pure performance but adopts a no-compromise approach in every area that matters.
content,"NoneNoneDesignNoneNoneThe Dell G3 15 weighs little under 2.5 kgs with dimensions similar to that of most gaming laptops with same specs. The design overall on the G3 15 gives it a bit of an edge, making it look more like a gaming laptop than last generation’s G3. Additionally, the power button on the G3 15 doubles as a fingerprint reader, while the 720p webcam will get the job done for simple video chats.Touchpad & KeyboardDell has also managed to fit a full-sized backlit keyboard on the G3. The keys feature a nice actuation point, offering a nice bit of tactility while gaming. Typing is also a pleasant experience on the new G3, considering the keys are nicely spaced out and don’t seem squished. Overall, the keyboard on the new G3 is great for gaming and typing.NoneThe G3 also has a smooth and responsive touchpad that definitely gets the job done. The palm rest area seems pretty sturdy, ensuring zero flex when typing. Overall, the touchpad on the Dell G3 is not the best but gets the job done.PortsThe Dell G3 15 (2019) also features a healthy assortment of I/O. There’s a USB Type-C port, an HDMI out, Ethernet port, headphone jack and USB 3.1 Type-A port on the left. One the right, you get a full-size SD card slot, a lock slot and two USB 2.0 Type-A ports. The new G3 offers more than enough ports to connect several accessories to the laptop, while gaming.NoneDisplayDell new G3 gaming laptop features a 15.6-inch display with a 1080p resolution. The screen is supported by a single hinge and is surrounded by moderately sized bezels on either side. The new G3 also features a 144Hz refresh rate, which is excellent for an entry-level laptop. However, it covers under 70-per cent of the sRGB colour gamut, which is expected at this price but is still considerably low.NonePerformanceNoneOlder E-sports titles like DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and Counter Strike: Global Offensive offered an average of over 70 fps with the settings maxed out. We’d recommend lowering the settings to “high” to take full advantage of the 144Hz screen. Battle Royale’s like PUBG, Fortnite and Apex Legends also performed well. Fortnite on high settings will get you an average of above 100 fps, while Apex Legends offers between 60 and 70 fps.NoneThe new G3 is an excellent gaming laptop, which is more than capable of running AAA titles with decent frame rates. We tested Battlefield V, Darksiders III, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, getting between 40 to 60 fps on medium settings on all three titles.One area where the Dell G3 15 does particularly well is cooling. The new design leaves a lot of room for cooling with vents on the sides and back of the machine as well as twin 50 mm fans and two heat pipes between them. The cooling system on the G3 is one of the best on an entry-level series. While we did notice a bit of throttling, it doesn’t have much effect on the overall gaming experience.AudioThe fans on the new Dell G3 run no matter the task at hand. However, the G3 has an excellent speaker system. Audio quality on the integrated speakers is one of the best we’ve seen on an entry-level gaming laptop. And, while we’d recommend headphones for a better experience, the G3 offers impressive sound on maximum volume.NoneBatteryDell’s latest entry-level gaming laptop packs a 51WHr battery that isn’t bad for a gaming laptop. In our battery tests, the new G3 fared quite well, almost reaching six hours in web browsing with 40-per cent screen brightness. When we multitasked between MS Word, Excel, and Chrome, the G3 offered little over five hours of battery life. Gaming on the battery is possible but will cause a severe dip in performance and deliver no more than one hour of playtime.VerdictNoneHowever, and this is one big “however”, the new Dell G3 15 scores above average in all categories. What Dell is offering in the new G3 is an overall package that may not be worth every penny in terms of pure performance but adopts a no-compromise approach in every area that matters.NoneThe display offers decent brightness levels while offering a 144Hz refresh rate that’s more than the average 120Hz found on most entry-level gaming laptops. The new design looks edgy, while there are plenty of ports for connecting multiple accessories and the keyboard strikes the right balance between gaming and typing. Moreover, the new cooling design ensures excellent performance. Lastly, the battery life on the new G3 is well-above the average of any gaming laptop, little alone an entry-level one.The new Dell G3 15 may be a little more expensive than similarly specced laptops, but that’s only because it sets a much higher bar than most of its competition. So, in terms of our value test, the new G3 passes with flying colours."

content,"NoneFurther, its market cap value equalled with 19 Nifty50 companies or Nifty250 Smallcap index stocks. Globally, it (worth of $140 billion) also surpassed its rival Total SA ($128.5 billion) and BP Plc ($99.13 billion).As a result, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani remained the country's richest man, with a net worth of $60.7 billion, and Asia's 13th richest person, which is equivalent to the combined GDP of countries like Zimbabwe ($19.4 billion), Mauritius ($14 billion) and Iceland ($26.6 billion).NoneHere is the journey of RIL's market cap since 2005:NoneThanks to telecom (Reliance Jio Infocomm) and retail (Reliance Retail) or mainly consumer businesses which made investors, as well as analysts, confident about the company's growth and brought the stock back from long consolidation phase to growth phase.In fact, after hovering in the range of Rs 350-550 levels since 2009, the stock gathered steam in 2016 when it launched Jio and, since then, it turned a multibagger for investors. It rallied 220 percent in the last three years against the Nifty50's 50 percent rally in the same period.As per the data available on the BSE website, the opening tick was Rs 115 on January 2, 1991. Today, it closed at Rs 1,579.95 on the BSE (up 0.65 percent over previous price). The intraday all-time high stood at Rs 1,584.NoneIn terms of example, if one invested Rs 10,000 in Reliance during IPO in 1977, those shares would have currently valued at Rs 2.1 crore.Moreover, the consistent growth in consumer businesses and the recent asset monetisation plan to reduce debt significantly along with expected tariff hike prompted brokerages to turn more bullish on the stock and raised price targets.Maintaining its overweight call on RIL, last week, global brokerage Morgan Stanley said its bull case target price stood at Rs 2,000 (a potential upside of 27 percent from current levels) on hopes of higher refinery margins, potential telecom tariff hike, bottoming P/E cycle, kickstart of gas production, lower capex and ongoing deleveraging.Bank of America Merrill Lynch also said the company was expected to touch Rs 14 lakh crore in market cap in the coming months.""We will put two important factors that should be seen as a catalyst for this share. Firstly, the Reliance Jio disruption. This company has seen a stellar growth with a market share of more than 30 percent and is on the rise. The second is the stake sale to Aramco has further made its valuation going forward attractive since their aim to achieve the debt-free balance sheet is likely to be seen in FY20-21,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research, told Moneycontrol.In fact, Reliance is the stock that is carrying much of its weight to lift the benchmark indices up.""Hence, it is more of a value play where everyone from retail to portfolio managers wants this to be in the portfolio since it is also outperforming from the last few months,"" Nadeem said.He believes the stock can continue to go north.""There was a recent consolidation and that was fairly utilized as a minor dip. These dips may be seen in the future and any correction in stock to 3-4 percent should rather be seen as an opportunity. We believe investors or traders should also put risk-reward into play while buying any stock and stock like reliance should be added but on any minor dips towards lower levels of Rs 1,440-1,460,"" he said.Sharekhan said RIL had been its high-conviction investment idea for the past one year. The brokerage anticipated the re-rating in the counter, given its expectation of strong earnings growth in retail business and strong profitability in the digital services business.While maintaining a buy rating on Reliance Industries with a revised SoTP-based price target of Rs 1,785, going forward, Sharekhan also believes that more re-rating catalyst like balance sheet deleveraging (target to become zero net debt company by March-2020) and value unlocking from the retail and digital services businesses.HSBC also retained its buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 1,700 per share as it believes Jio and Retail are set to continue to drive upside. ""RIL's consumer businesses are driving the upside and valuation of RIL does not appear expensive,"" the brokerage said.In October, RIL approved the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) for Digital Platform initiatives and said Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) would become virtually net debt free company by FY20-end, with the exception of spectrum-related liabilities.Its retail business has grown phenomenally, registering a seven-fold increase in revenue and a 14-fold increase in profit in the last six years.Jio has already become the largest operator in India and is still signing up more than 10 million new customers each month. On November 19, it said it would raise the tariffs and data charges in the next few weeks.""Jio's tariff can bring annual cash flow of more than $1.5 billion. Hence, we increased FY20/21/22 EPS estimates by 15/12/20 percent. The Jio price increase is earlier-than-expected,"" said Credit Suisse which was the only brokerage (as per our list) had maintained neutral rating with a target price at Rs 1,400.The two consumer businesses now collectively contribute nearly 32 percent to its consolidated EBITDA, up from two percent five years ago. The management is targeting their share to be 50 percent in the next few years.On the strength of RIL's existing and new growth engines, the management is confident of growing this by 15 percent annually over the next five years.RIL and Saudi Aramco have agreed to a non-binding letter of intent (LOI), wherein the latter may acquire a 20 percent stake in the ‘oil-to-chemicals’ division at an enterprise value of $75 billion. In fact, the Saudi Aramco also mentioned about this investment in its IPO.RIL have received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in their consumer businesses, Jio and Reliance Retail. The company will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters and move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years, which will result in significant value unlocking."

title,What should existing clients of Karvy Stock Broking do?
datetime,2019-11-26 15:56:00+00:00
description,Choose a new DP with care and stick to large and well-established names
content,"If you have a demat account with Karvy Stock Broking, these must be trying times for you. Last Friday, the capital market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued an interim order that banned Karvy Stock Broking from enrolling any new clients. The order was based on an inspection carried out by the National Stock Exchange that revealed how the broking outfit mis-used clients’ shares lying in their demat accounts, pledged such shares to raise money and transferred the same to its sister firm, Karvy Realty Pvt. Ltd. SEBI also put a freeze on all the power of attorneys that clients of Karvy Stock Broking had given to the firm. So, if you have your demat account, what should you do?What happens to my equity shares and bonds lying in my Karvy Stock Broking demat account?If nothing has gone wrong with your own demat account, your equity shares and bonds in your Karvy Stock Broking’s demat account should still be in your demat account. Transfer your securities out of your Karvy account, but we’ll get to that in a bit.First things first, check your existing Karvy Stock Broking’s demat account. Get the latest statement sent to you by either of the depositories and verify it with statements you would have got before. Check the securities’ names and their respective quantities and ensure everything is in order. If the number of shares does not tally, then try to recall if you have sold some of your shares recently. After this exercise, if the number of shares is lower than what you held earlier, you need to file a complaint with either the Central Depository Services Ltd (CDSL) or National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) – the entity connected to your demat account. You also need to file a complaint with SEBI under its complaint-filing mechanism.The depositories send you an account statement of your equity and mutual fund holdings every month, if you make a transaction every month. Check those statements. If you haven’t bought or sold anything for quite some time, then you get a statement every quarter. “Investors must reconcile their statements regularly. These sort of events (Karvy Stock Broking) happen because investors are not vigilant. They buy some shares and then forget about them,” says Mukesh Dedhia, a Mumbai-based distributor of financial products and a stock broker.Do I have to open another demat account?Yes, it is better to open a demat account with another depository participant (DP). Choose your new DP with care and stick to large and well-established names, preferably an arm of a bank or a well-established firm. Make sure you open a new demat account in the same name and combination as your Karvy Stock Broking account. Submit a closure request form to Karvy and transfer all your securities to your new demat account. Although SEBI has frozen many activities of Karvy Stock Broking, you can still close your account here and transfer all your securities.Since you will transfer all your securities and close your Karvy demat account, this will be an off-market transfer and therefore you do not have to pay any capital gains tax. Transferring select securities attracts charges; transferring all securities does not.I bought some shares recently, but they haven’t been deliveredCheck for any incomplete trades. If you bought some shares through Karvy Stock Broking, but haven’t yet got those shares delivered to your demat account, file a complaint with the stock exchanges. Since the stock exchanges regulate the brokers, you need to file a complaint with either the NSE or the BSE.Guwahati-based Pallav Bagaria, director, Sapient Wealth Advisors and Brokers—one of India’s largest financial services firms – presents us the tale of one of his friends who is yet to get Rs 35 lakh from Karvy Stock Broking from a recent sale of shares. “The gentleman is chasing the money every day, especially since SEBI’s order was issued. But it has taken a lot of time,” says Bagaria. Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify this complaint. Earlier this year, SEBI issued instructions to brokers that they should remit the pending amount to all their clients on a quarterly basis, but Bagaria claims that “many stock brokers have not yet implemented this rule in the true spirit.”Keep a tab on the share quantityMost of us keep an eye on the value of our holdings in the demat account and feel happy if we are in profits. But it’s equally important to keep a check on the quantity of shares. “These days, we receive our account statements regularly and also via email. Investors must take responsibility and keep a regular check,” says Dedhia."

content,"With India's financial services sector reeling under numerous cases of defaults, the latest episode involving Karvy Stock Broking has spooked the trading community and raised question marks over the practices followed by brokerages.In what now appears as timely regulatory intervention, markets regulator SEBI's circular dated June 20, which came into effect from October 1, has acted as a mechanism to promptly identify instances where brokers are misusing funds and securities in their clients’ accounts. According to the circular, brokerages have to settle the accounts of clients on a quarterly basis, failing which clients can complain to the regulator. Before the implementation of the circular, there were instances of brokers like Unicorn, Kasa Finvest and Amrapali allegedly misusing client funds.SEBI got wind of the goings on at Karvy in mid-October when the brokerage used clients funds for proprietary trading.  The regulator then carried out a reconciliation exercise of the client accounts.NoneSEBI then immediately alerted NSE to keep a tab on the brokerage.Despite being given time by SEBI, Karvy has been able to release only Rs 600 crore out of Rs 2,800 crore of client shares that it had pledged, according to the source.Another source said that timely action by SEBI has limited the damage to some extent.""As of now, almost 90,000 clients have been affected due to this fiasco. However, on the other side, around Rs 2000 crore is still in the company which they have pledged with banks. Banks and NBFCs should be aware that collateral belongs to whom. Banks say they are authorised to sell collateral. But these shares actually belong to the clients and not the broker,"" a source said.NoneAccording to the SEBI circular of June 2019, Trading Member and/or Clearing Member are required to transfer the clients securities received in payout to clients demat account within one working day. In case the client does not pay for such securities received in payout, then the TM/CM shall be entitled to retain those securities up to five trading days after payout."

description,"National Milk Day, November 26th, celebrated on Dr Kurien’s birth anniversary, is an opportune moment for us to reflect upon Dr Kurien’s life and what takeaways it has for India’s growth story."
content,"Hitesh BhattWe are living in times where the debate on agrarian distress and stagnant rural incomes has become a perennial feature in the national discourse. According to a Nielsen report, rural India grew at five percent in terms of value, sharply slower than 20 percent reported a year earlier for the quarter ending in September 2019. This is the lowest growth rate reported in the last seven years.This decline in rural growth is worrying for a country aiming to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025, where the majority of its workforce is engaged in agriculture and allied activities and mainly resides in remote rural geographies.Augmenting rural income through improved and sustainable livelihoods is an urgent need of the hour. Many lessons can be drawn from the exemplary story of India’s White Revolution spearheaded by the Milkman of India, Dr. Verghese Kurien.In 1950, the farmers of Kaira cooperative employed Dr. Verghese Kurien, a young engineer from the University of Michigan, as a professional manager to run their dairy cooperative enterprise.Dr Kurien introduced five key changes that transformed the dairy sector paradigm. First, milk being a highly perishable commodity with seasonal supply fluctuations, Dr Kurien created a robust supply chain for milk procurement from villages to customer's doorstep.Second, he brought in modern technology and production systems at the dairy, most famously the first-ever plant in the world for manufacturing buffalo milk powder.Thirdly, he introduced innovative marketing, making Amul the most enduring brand in Indian marketing history. Fourthly, he built an ecosystem of organisations to focus on different aspects of the dairy industry such as policy, strategy, innovation, and teaching.The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI), Vidya Dairy and the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation are an outcome of that effort.The last and the most important step he introduced was the Billion Litre Idea in 1970 - a strategic vision to scale up the dairy cooperative model pan India. The idea led to the well-known Operation Flood which culminated in India surpassing the US to become the world’s largest milk producer by 1998. Most importantly, livelihoods were created for more than 15 million farmers pan India by replicating the dairy cooperative model through Operation Flood.A robust supply chain, modern technology & production systems, marketing, organisation building, and a strategic vision transformed the lives of dairy farmers in India.In other words, it took professional management to bring about a visible socio-economic impact to an underserved segment of India’s economy. Today, about 70 percent of India’s population resides in the rural sector, a sector known for its predominantly agrarian workforce, remote and inaccessible geographies and high incidence of poverty.Agriculture and allied activities despite employing a majority of Indians, contribute a mere 15 percent to India’s GDP. Another 4 percent of India in urban areas are living below the poverty line. Unlocking the income potential of these underserved segments of our economy to reach our $5-trillion dollar dream requires trained professional managers.The occasion of National Milk Day celebrated on Dr Kurien’s birth anniversary, is an opportune moment for us to reflect upon Dr Kurien’s life and what takeaways it has for India’s growth story."

description,Moving average is an indicator to analyse price trend of a security. It is an average of closing price of a security over a specified period of time.
content,"What is a moving average? How is it calculated?Moving average is an indicator that is used to analyse the price trend of a security. It is an average of the closing price of a security over a specified period of time. A moving average helps the trader to smoothen out the price action by filtering out its daily price movement.There are two type of moving averages that traders use : Simple and Exponential.The calculation of the simple moving average of a stock depends on the time period in question. For example: A simple moving average for five days is calculated by taking the closing price of the last five days and dividing the total by 5.An exponential moving average is calculated by taking the simple moving average and a multiplier for giving higher weights to recent prices.When the price of a security tends to stay above the moving average, it is known to be on an up-trend and when the price tends to stay below the moving average, it indicates that it is on a down-trend.Moving average is calculated on historical stock prices. Hence, it is a lagging indicator. Moving averages work well in a trending market and does not work in a choppy market.What is a simple moving average?Simple moving average or SMA is simply the average price over a given period of time.A 50 day SMA on a given day is the average price of the last 50 days of a given security. After the end of a trading day, the earliest price is dropped and replaced by the latest price data for calculating the moving average i.e. it is calculated on a rolling basisAn SMA gives equal weight to all prices for the given time period.NoneExponential moving average or EMA is the moving average where more weights are given to the recent price data, hence it reacts more significantly to the latest data as compared to a SMAEMA is calculated by 2 data points : SMA and a multiplierThe multiplier is calculated by the formula [2/(time period+1)]. So for a 50 day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(50+1)] = 0.0392The EMA is calculated by the following formula:Current EMA = (Closing price – previous day EMA) * multiplier + previous day's EMA where SMA is the simple moving average.NoneThe calculation makes the EMA quicker to react to recent price changes as compared to SMAAn EMA responds to a price action quicker than an SMA in a short period, which helps the trader to catch the trend earlier.On the other hand, during a period of consolidation when price spikes can be seen, an EMA responds to them quickly, leading to believe that a trend is forming. Similarly in a trending market, the SMA will be slow to react and one might miss the initial move of the trend.Choosing a moving average depends on what is one’s trading style. Moving averages work because so many traders use it in their trading system. Thus one has to stick to the most commonly used moving averages to get the best results.A short term trader should stick to an EMA and use shorter time frame moving averages such as 5-day, 10-day, 20-day moving average.A long term trader can use an EMA or SMA having longer time frames such as 50-day, 100-day, 200-day moving averages.Initially, 5/10/20/50/100/200 day moving averages were used due to number of trading days in a time frame -  5 days a week , 10 days a fortnight, 20 days a month and so on. Today however, we trade 240 days a year with lesser holidays but the most used moving average is the 200 daily moving average.A crossover of a fast EMA/SMA above or below a slow EMA/SMA may also denote an official change in trend.NoneMACD stands for moving average convergence / divergence. It is an indicator which reveals the changes in strength, direction, momentum and duration of a trend.MACD represents a line which is calculated by subtracting a long term (26 day EMA) from a short term (12 day EMA). A 9 day EMA of the MACD line itself is known as the signal line, which functions as a buy or sell signalWhen MACD crosses above the signal line, it is a buy signal and similarly when MACD crosses below the signal line, it is a sell signalThe value of MACD is positive when the shorter EMA is above the longer EMA and negative when vice versa.As the MACD line (faster line) moves away from signal line (slower line), it is called divergence, and as they get closer to each other, it is called convergence."

title,NFO: What are new fund offers?
datetime,2019-11-27 20:47:00+00:00
description,New fund offers (NFOs) are first time subscription offers when a fund company launches a new mutual fund. Check out the best reasons to invest in a new fund offer.
content,"The process through which a mutual fund scheme launches a new mutual fund is called a New Fund Offer or NFO. As per the guidelines of the securities market regulator SEBI, a New Fund Offer can be open for a maximum of 30 days. An NFO can be cancelled if the investors do not show much interest in subscribing to it.In the NFO period, investors can buy units from the mutual fund scheme to subscribe to the NFO at the price of an offer. Usually, this is Rs 10. Upon the expiry of the NFO, the buyers would be willing to buy the fund's units at the current price in the market. Usually, after listing, NFO subscribers gain significant profits.NFOs are first-time offers to subscribe to a new scheme launched by an asset management company. In order to purchase securities like stocks or government bonds from the economy, it is introduced to raise funds from the public. Usually, a fund company launches an NFO to complete its item basket, or if the investors request a specific investment theme. Closed-end funds, which are usually 3-3.5 years old, can only be purchased during the NFO period.NFOs are introduced for funds that are new and have no previous track record. This makes NFO slightly uncertain as it is not possible to predict how the fund will behave. The investor must read the offer document carefully. It is also important to understand the investment process that the fund manager is going to follow.An NFO needs to explain clearly its investment process, which it will carry out for the investment horizon. The investors should be prepared to comprehend from the offer document what the fund manager will do with the investment money. If the investors are unable to determine the NFO's goals, then the investment method demonstrates weaknesses. A new fund offer can be launched for two types of schemes:Open-ended funds: this fund is formally introduced following the end of the NFO. At any moment after the release, investors can join and leave the fund.Close-ended funds: Until its maturity, a close-ended fund does not allow investors to enter and/or leave after the NFO. Typically, this duration is of 3-4 years from the date of the launch of NFO. However, investors may theoretically purchase and sell such a fund's units on the stock market, but the liquidity of such funds on the market tends to be small.Here are the benefits of an NFO:Flexibility: Close funds have flexibility when to invest your money on the market. At other times, the fund manager can hold on to your resources and spend the investment amount a little later., even after the launch of the NFO.Diversification: NFO allows you to diversify your investment portfolio.No large cash influx: Open-ended funds are prone to sudden outflows and inflows of cash and market volatility. This can force the fund manager to sell his stocks at very low prices, causing a loss to all unit holders in the fund. On the other hand, close-ended funds are locked-in until maturity. This allows the fund manager to make the right investment decisions.Low minimum subscription amounts: There is a specified minimum subscription amount for an NFO. It usually ranges between Rs 500 to even Rs 5,000. The low pricing makes NFO an attractive choice for investors.Here are a few reasons why you should invest in a new fund offer:NFO is a popular investment option as the net asset value (NAV) is priced at Rs 10 per unit. This makes the NFO cheaper compared to the other funds available in the market. It is a great investment option for investors who are looking for cheaper options with the prospect of a good return.An NFO allows you instant liquidity as the unit holders of an open-ended scheme can sell or buy the units at any time. There is no lock-in restrictions in the open-ended fund.The lock-in restrictions of a close-ended fund actually acts as a deterrent against bad investing behaviour. It helps you to make the right investment decisions without getting lured in by the promise of hefty returns.NFO offers you good and steady returns. Though past track record is not available, you can always review the current returns. It is advisable to do so on a quarterly basis.NFO is a great investment option for those investors who have a long-term investment horizon.The price of the mutual fund is regulated by demand and supply in the market. It is possible to trade the fund at a price that is above or below its real value.Investors usually get confused between NFO and IPO as they seem to operate on a similar framework. It is important to understand the difference between the two. An IPO is the process through which shares of a private company are listed on stock exchanges and helps the company to go public. On the other hand, the New Fund Offer is a mode of launching a mutual fund scheme to the investors.The IPO price of the shares can be more or less than the actual price of the shares. The price of the share in an IPO is determined through a book-building process. During the period for which the IPO is open, bids are collected from investors at various prices, which are above or equal to the floor price. The offer price is determined after the bid closing date.However, no such process of price-discovery is followed in the case of NFO. The pricing of a new fund offer is as per the market value of the units. The market value of the units is also known as the net asset value or NAV. The NAV remains the same even after the new fund offer period closes. The NAV is not susceptible to any price fluctuations as is the case with IPOs.If you’re someone who is looking to invest in mutual funds, you have two options. Invest online or offline by visiting a branch. However, you also have the option of approaching an agent for the same. However, if you’re going through an agent, you need to remember that the agent needs to be registered with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), and needs to have a valid AMFI registration number (ARN). You can check if your agent is legally authorised to sell you a mutual fund or invest in a mutual fund on your behalf by visiting the website http://www.amfiindia.com/locate-the-nearest-financial-advisor.If you are a corporate distributor, then you need to ensure that your employees have registered Employee Unique Identification Numbers (EUIN)). As a distributor, it is also your job to disclose all the commissions payable to you for different competing schemes of various mutual funds.If you’re investing through a direct plan, then you need to remember that you need to have a financial advisor. However, you need not pay any commission to a distributor, as it maximises the returns from the close-ended mutual funds.If the investment is done through a distributor, they are required to disclose all the commissions (in the form of trail commission or any other mode) payable to them for the different competing schemes of various mutual funds out of which the scheme is being recommended to the investor.Investors also have the option to invest directly with the mutual fund either by visiting the mutual fund branch or online through mutual fund website. Forms can be deposited with mutual funds through the agents and distributors who provide such services.If you are investing in mutual funds, you can use the online trading account for investing in NFO. The account allows you to purchase and sell your NFO units online without any hassle. The online trading account also allows you to track the net asset value or NAV of your investments.An investor also has the option of investing in NFO through one of the online aggregator websites. This is a hassle-free process and allows investment once KYC is completed.Investors should not be carried away by commission/gift which is promised by the distributors or agents. Every investor must conduct its own due diligence of the NFO and take an objective investment decision. There are a number of other web sites that give a lot of information about NFO.Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. An investor should carefully read all the scheme related documents. Special attention must be given to the main features of the scheme, risk factors and recurring expenses to be charged to the scheme, loads, sponsor’s track record, educational qualification and work experience of key personnel including fund managers, performance of other schemes launched by the mutual fund in the past, pending litigations and penalties imposed, etc.An investor should take into account his appetite, age factor, financial position, investment objective, investment horizon, etc. If required, investors should consult financial experts before taking decisions.Before making an investment, the investor should take into account the track record of the mutual fund/scheme. Investors should also refer to the product labeling of the scheme. As per SEBI regulations, all the mutual funds are required to label their schemes on the following parameters:a)  Nature of scheme – whether the aim is to create wealth or provide regular income in an indicative time horizon (short/ medium/ long term).b)  A brief about the investment objective (in a single line sentence) followed by kind of product in which investor is investing (equity/debt).c)   Level of risk depicted by a pictorial meter as under:- Low - principal at low risk- Moderately Low - principal at moderately low risk- Moderate - principal at moderate risk- Moderately High - principal at moderately high risk- High - principal at high riskProduct labeling should be disclosed in:a. Front page of initial offering application forms, Key Information Memorandum (KIM) andScheme Information Documents (SIDs).b. Common application form – along with the information about the scheme.The performance of a particular scheme of a mutual fund is indicated by the Net Asset Value (NAV).NAV represents the market value of the securities held by the scheme. Since the market value of securities changes every day, NAV of the same scheme varies on a day to day basis. The NAV per unit is the market value of securities of a scheme divided by the total number of units of the scheme on any particular date.For instance, if the market value of securities of a mutual fund scheme is Rs 200 lakh and the mutual fund has issued 10 lakh units of Rs 10 each to the investors, then the NAV per unit of the fund is Rs 20 (i.e.200 lakh/10 lakh). NAV is required to be disclosed by the mutual funds on a daily basis.NAV has to be disclosed by the mutual funds on a regular basis. Depending on the type of the scheme, the declaration can be on all business days or on a weekly basis.  As per SEBI Regulations, the NAV of a scheme shall be calculated and published at least in two daily newspapers at intervals not exceeding one week. The NAVs should also be made available on the websites of mutual funds. Fund houses are also required to put their NAVs on the website of Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) www.amfiindia.com. This allows investors to access the NAVs of all mutual funds in one place.The expense ratio refers to the annual fund operating expenses of a scheme, which is expressed as a percentage of the fund’s daily net assets. Operating expenses of a scheme include the administration, management, advertising related expenses, etc. If the expense ratio of a mutual fund is 1 percent per annum, it means that each year 1 percent of the fund’s total assets will be used to cover expenses. Information on expense ratios that may be applicable to a scheme is mentioned in the offer document. As per the present regulations, there is no limit on any particular type of allowed expense as long as the total expense ratio is within the prescribed limits by SEBI.From 2013, SEBI has mandated mutual funds to launch a direct plan for direct investments, which allows investors to invest directly without routing it through a distributor. Direct plans have a lower expense ratio excluding distribution expenses, commission, etc., and no commission is to be paid from such plans. The plan also has a separate NAV. The investor has a choice to make the investment either a lump sum amount, i.e. a onetime payment, or through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)."

description,"Open-ended Mutual Fund is an investment scheme where the shares can be issued and redeemed at any time. Read more on how it works, who should invest & how to invest."
content,"A mutual fund is an investment option. It involves pooling in money from investors for investment in a variety of underlying securities. A mutual fund house issues unit of mutual funds to investors in proportion to their investment money.The objectives of the mutual fund are disclosed in the offer document. The profits or losses are shared by investors in proportion to their investments.A mutual fund must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) before it can collect funds from the public.On the basis of structures, mutual funds can be classified into two categories: open-ended mutual funds and close-ended mutual fund. Open-ended schemes are available for subscription and repurchase on a continuous basis. There is no fixed maturity period. Investors have the option to buy and sell units at NAV which is declared on a daily basis. The past performance of these assets can be tracked which allows the investor to make a well-informed decision. If the investor is looking for liquidity alone, these funds are a great option.A mutual fund is floated in the market through a new fund offer. In case of open-ended funds, an investor can purchase or sell units of an open-ended mutual fund at any time after the closure of NFO. The NFO is usually open for a maximum period of 30 days. Investment in these funds can be made through systematic investment plans (SIPs) and systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs).In open-ended mutual funds, units are purchased and sold on demand at the net asset value of the fund.  The NAV fluctuates every day based on the prices of the stocks and bonds in the market. There is no limitation on the number of units of the mutual fund that can be issued. There is no set maturity period for these funds. Once an investor redeems the units of an open-ended fund, the units are taken off the market.  However, an investor has to pay exit loads for units that are sold within 1 year.The fund is professionally managed by the fund manager. This scheme is a great option for investors who do not want to actively monitor their investments but are looking at optimal returns.Here are the key advantages of investing in these funds- Access to liquidity: There are no restrictions on the investor to redeem the units of an open-ended fund. This provides access to liquidity to the investors at any time they want. Moreover, the investors can redeem the funds as per the net asset value as on the day of redemption.- Past performance: Investors of these funds can track the performance of the funds. The historical data available helps the investor take the best investment decision.- Various systematic options available: These funds allow investors to make use of systematic plans for making investments and withdrawal. The investor can choose from SIPs, SWPs and systematic transfer plans.Diversified portfolios: Open-ended funds invest a range of assets. The stocks belong to a variety of industries and companies. A diversified portfolio helps to reduce the risks associated with investments.- Higher returns:  These funds provide better returns in the long run compared to other schemes. For an investor with a short-term investment horizon, open-ended funds offer the perfect solution.Investment in any type of mutual fund depends on the investment objectives of the investor. These funds are best suited for investors who want easy access to liquidity without any restriction. Investment in these funds can also be considered by investors who are looking to diversify their investment portfolios.In addition to the above, the investor should also meet the standard eligibility criteria laid down by SEBI. As per SEBI, an investor of a mutual fund can be Indian residents above the age of 18, Non-resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) residing abroad, companies (including public sector undertakings), corporate bodies, trusts (through trustees) and cooperative societies, religious and charitable trusts (through trustees), and private trusts authorised to invest in mutual fund schemes under their trust deeds, foreign institutional investors registered with SEBI, and other individuals or institutions, as approved by asset management companies, so long they conform to SEBI regulations.Investors can invest directly or contact the agents and distributors of mutual funds for necessary information and application forms. Investors must ensure that they invest through the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) registered distributors and that the distributor has a valid AMFI Registration Number (ARN).For investments through the direct plan, the investor needs a financial adviser but does not have to pay any commissions to the distributors. This maximizes the returns from the close-ended mutual funds. If the investment is done through a distributor, they are required to disclose all the commissions (in the form of trail commission or any other mode) payable to them for the different competing schemes of various mutual funds out of which the scheme is being recommended to the investor.Investors also have the option to invest directly in mutual funds either by visiting the mutual fund branch or online through mutual fund websites.

Front page of initial offering application forms, Key Information Memorandum (KIM) andScheme Information Documents (SIDs).b. Common application form – along with the information about the scheme.It is possible to change the nature of the scheme. However, SEBI has laid down certain regulations which need to be complied with for affecting such a change:Any changes in the fundamental attributes of the scheme such as the structure, investment pattern, etc., can be changed only when written communication is sent to each unitholder and an advertisement is given in one English daily newspaper having nationwide circulation. The information should also be published in a newspaper published in the language of the region where the head office of the mutual fund is situated. In case the unitholders do not want to continue with the scheme, they have the option of exiting the present scheme at prevailing NAV without bearing exit load.As per SEBI regulations, every mutual fund has the obligation to disclose full portfolios of all of their schemes on a monthly basis on their website. Portfolio disclosure on a half-yearly basis is published in the newspapers. The fund house can also send the disclosure of half-yearly portfolios to their unitholders.The performance of a particular scheme of a mutual fund is indicated by the Net Asset Value (NAV).NAV represents the market value of the securities held by the scheme. Since the market value of securities changes every day, NAV of the same scheme varies on a day to day basis. The NAV per unit is the market value of securities of a scheme divided by the total number of units of the scheme on any particular date. For instance, if the market value of securities of a mutual fund scheme is INR 200 lakh and the mutual fund has issued 10 lakh units of INR 10 each to the investors, then the NAV per unit of the fund is INR 20 (i.e.200 lakh/10 lakh). NAV is required to be disclosed by the mutual funds on a daily basis."

description,Index Mutual Fund: An index fund is a mutual fund that imitates the portfolio of market index. Check out the list of top index funds in India at Moneycontrol.
content,"There are various types of mutual funds available in the market. One of the specialized types of mutual funds is called an index fund. These funds replicate the portfolio of a particular index such as the BSE Sensitive index (Sensex), NSE 50 index (Nifty), etc which are the most popular indices in India.Index funds invest in securities in the same weightage comprising an index. The increase or decrease in the NAV is in accordance with the rise or fall in the index. However, it does not mirror the index exactly by the same percentage due to some factors known as “tracking error”.Index funds, unlike actively managed funds, passively monitor a specific index's performance. The purpose of these resources is not to surpass the market. The only goal is to imitate the index output.Since the portfolio of index funds are not actively managed, as the fund house does not buy and sell shares to produce returns, the index funds are relatively cheaper than other schemes.Index funds are becoming one of the most popular investment avenues. Due to its passive nature, a lot of new investors prefer index funds. Here are the benefits of investing in an index fund:Globally, it has been observed that it becomes difficult for fund managers to beat their benchmarks as markets become more effective. In such markets, passive funds such as index funds are becoming the preferred investment vehicle. Index funds are hugely popular in India. They have a substantial presence in the large-cap room.Index funds are also appealing due to their lower cost. The expense ratios for active funds are very high when compared to index funds.The funds have an automatic clean-up of the portfolios. The indices used removed any asset which is underperforming. As an investor, you don’t have to worry if you have invested in a slow-performing asset; the index will do that job for you.Index funds do not need any active management. Since the investors need not be concerned about the performance of certain funds, they can focus their attention to revaluating their portfolios periodically.There is no security-specific risk as the investment is made in a basket of assets. A single share cannot cause major damage to the indices used.There are a variety of index funds. Here is what you need to know:- Broad market: A big market index seeks to capture a wide range of the market.  Large market index funds have typically the smallest expenditure ratios. Asset sales in broad index funds are really small and highly tax-efficient. A broad market index fund is suited for investors who want to get a basket with a variety of shares or bonds.- International index funds: Global index funds provide you an international exposure. As an investor, you can purchase funds that monitor indexes that are not linked to a particular geographic region in emerging markets or frontier markets.- Market capitalization: Investors who have a long-time investment horizon can benefit from increased exposure to a wide basket of small and medium-sized enterprises. Index funds can achieve this objective based on market capitalization.- Bond based index funds:  The use of bond index funds can help you to maintain a healthy combination of short, intermediate, and long-term bond maturities which generate steady revenues.- Earnings based: Index funds can also work on the basis of the profits or earnings of a company. There are two types of indices linked to companies: growth indexes and value indexes. Growth indexes are made up of businesses that are expected to generate profits quicker than the others in the market. Value indexes consist of stocks that are trading at a lower cost compared to the earnings of the company.Since index funds monitor a specific index, they are passively managed funds. The fund manager chooses which stocks should be purchased and sold in accordance with the underlying index that the fund is following. There is a separate analysis undertaken to identify and select stocks for investments, unlike actively managed funds.If an index fund monitors a benchmark such as the Nifty, its portfolio will have the same proportions of the 1000 stocks that make up Nifty. If two index funds are tracking the same underlying index, they will offer the same returns. However, the fund that has a lower expense ratio will generate relatively greater yields on investment.The job of an active fund is to meet its benchmark. However, the function of an index fund is to match its efficiency to its index performance. Index funds typically yield returns that are more or less equivalent to the benchmark. There may be a tiny distinction between the results of the fund and the index which is called a tracking error.  The fund manager ensures that the tracking error is reduced as much as possible.Index funds are the perfect option for someone who wants to invest in equities but does not want to track their performances. Index funds offer returns that are linked to the performance of a  particular index. Index funds also work for investors who have a long-term investment horizon.Having said that, it is important to note that index funds yields may, in the short term, match the yields of actively managed funds. However, in the long run, the actively managed fund continues to perform better.In case you’re looking to invest in a mutual fund, you can do so in two ways: directly or through an agent. In the case of direct, you can invest either online or offline. However, in case you’re going through an investor, ensure that they are registered with the Association of Mutual Funds in India and have a AMFI Registration Number.Investors can also invest in index funds directly without a distributor. For investments through the direct plan, the investor needs a financial adviser but does not have to pay any commissions to the distributors. This maximizes the returns as there is no commission paid.Investors also have the option to invest directly with the mutual fund either by visiting the mutual fund branch or online through mutual fund website. Forms can be deposited with mutual funds through the agents and distributors who provide such services.Before making an investment, the investor should take into account the track record of the index fund. As per SEBI regulations, all the mutual funds are required to label their schemes on the following parameters:a)  Nature of scheme – whether the aim is to create wealth or provide regular income in an indicative time horizon (short/ medium/ long term).b)  A brief about the investment objective (in a single line sentence) followed by kind of product in which investor is investing (equity/debt).c)   Level of risk depicted by a pictorial meter as under:-  Low - principal at low risk- Moderately Low - principal at moderately low risk- Moderate - principal at moderate risk- Moderately High - principal at moderately high risk- High - principal at high riskAn investor should take into account the product labeling before investing in index funds.Load refers to the charge collected by a mutual fund when the units are sold. There are two types of loads: entry load and exit load. Entry load is levied when the investor buys a unit whereas exit load applied when the units are sold by the investor. At present, SEBI has mandated that no entry load can be charged by any mutual fund scheme.  The exit load charged is credited to the scheme.No scheme is allowed to increase the exit load beyond the level mentioned in the offer document. Any change in the load will be only for future investments and not to investments made earlier. If fresh loads are applicable or increased, the mutual funds are required to amend their offer documents so that the new investors are aware of loads at the time of investments.The investors should take the loads into consideration while making the investment as these affect their returns.ASBA is a facility provided by banks to investors in new fund offers (NFOs) of mutual funds. If you apply for an NFO via ASBA, the application amount gets blocked in your bank account. While the amount stays in your account, it cannot be used until you are allotted the unit of a mutual fund.There are no guaranteed returns for index funds investments. As an index fund simply tracks the performance of an index like Nifty or Sensex, it always remains subject to market volatility. It is important to read the offer document thoroughly to understand the risks of a mutual fund scheme.The expense ratio refers to the annual fund operating expenses of a scheme, which is expressed as a percentage of the fund’s daily net assets. Operating expenses of a scheme include the administration, management, advertising related expenses, etc. If the expense ratio of a mutual fund is 1 percent per annum, it means that each year 1 percent of the fund’s total assets will be used to cover expenses. Information on expense ratios that may be applicable to a scheme is mentioned in the offer document."

content,"It is a long-standing debate whether OTTs will kill the theatre business in India. But it looks like multiplex chain operator PVR and UK-headquartered MUBI, a streaming service dedicated to films only, think otherwise.Both the players have partnered to launch the cinema-going initiative called MUBI GO in India on November 27.As part of a MUBI subscription, members will now receive one complimentary ticket every week to see a film that has been hand-picked by MUBI, in any PVR Cinema, via the MUBI GO app. MUBI GO users will be able to redeem tickets for the selected films at any PVR cinema across India. The same will be valid in the classic seat category at all mainstream auditoriums.

Globally, we more than doubled our revenue and we are cash-flow positive. It is a healthy business and generating profits. Hence, MUBI can invest in India.""Plus, MUBI will also step into the production side business in India, after having done the same in the US and Europe.""We have to get into production in the long run. We have to produce our own movies. What drives our business is newer films on our platform,"" Cakarel added.Currently, MUBI has two segments --- MUBI World that offers international films and its recent addition called MUBI India which is dedicated to Indian cinema.Cakarel, who will be travelling to Chennai to know more about the southern film market, hopes to start a new channel just for Tamil films.On the back of strong content, Cakarel expects to register a user base of up to two million in the span of two years.In addition, Kamal Gianchadani, CEO, PVR Pictures, said that while initially the top 10 cities will be the main market for MUBI, the platform will also penetrate smaller towns.While MUBI has a lot to benefit from PVR, a question that remains is how will the new partnership prove fruitful for PVR?According to Gianchadani, OTT has not been cannibalising negative effect on cinema.""Last year was the biggest year in terms of box office for cinema and this year is turning out to be record breaking. In fact, OTT has become positive cycle. OTT is another revenue stream. Producers are making money and they in turn are making bigger and better films,"" he said."

title,Jharkhand Assembly Election: The challenges facing chief minister Raghubar Das
datetime,2019-12-02 19:02:00+00:00
description,"While union minister and senior BJP leader, Rajnath Singh, has said that the BJP will form a majority government in Jharkhand, observers have cast doubts over that possibility"
content,"The election in Jharkhand, political observers say, was already a complicated affair for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with the party having to tackle a number of issues both within and outside the party machinery.To add to that, BJP's performance in Haryana and Maharashtra— and then its eventual fallout— has compounded matters.At the centre of all this, and helming the BJP's campaign, is Chief Minister Raghubar Das. From being employed at Tata Steels to occupying the top post and being the first non-tribal chief minister of a state that has 26 percent tribal population, Das has had quite a journey. But in order to continue that journey ahead, Das has had to, and will have to, tackle a number of challenges.Internal strifeIn an 81-member Assembly, the BJP has set for itself an ambitious target of winning more than 65 seats. However, with the party facing infighting on the issue of distribution of tickets, that figure, observers have said, seems difficult for the BJP to achieve.In that context, Jamshedpur (East) would be the most keenly watched contest because it is Das' constituency and up against him is a former cabinet minister in his government, Sarayu Roy.NoneRoy, who is a senior BJP leader, is contesting with support from the Janata Dal (United) and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). Interestingly, JD(U) is BJP's alliance partner in Bihar while JMM has tied up with Congress for the assembly polls. While Congress has fielded its own candidate — party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh— the JMM chose to offer support to Roy.Reports have also suggested that with the rising popularity of the Arjun Munda camp within the party, if Das is unable to attain the required figure, Munda could be pushed as the alternative CM face. Munda, who is currently a Union minister, is a prominent tribal face in the state and has been the chief minister of Jharkhand before.NoneNon-tribal CM That Das is the first non-tribal to occupy the CM's post in Jharkhand might also go against him. Making him the first non-tribal CM in the state was part of the BJP high command's strategy to install unconventional faces to the top post in different states.In Haryana and Maharashtra, for instance, the BJP installed Manohar Lal Khattar and Devendra Fadnavis respectively. Both Khattar and Fadnavis did not belong to the politically influential Jat and Maratha communities.NoneThe strategy does not seem to have yielded expected results for the BJP in Haryana and Maharashtra, and Das would be hoping that Jharkhand proves to be an exception.Moreover, Das is also facing opposition from the tribal population over Land Acquisition Bill (2017) and amendments to the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act (SPTA) and Chotanagpur Tenancy Act (CTA).Alliance troubles Another factor common between Maharashtra and Jharkhand is the alliance trouble for the BJP.While in Maharashtra, the trouble started after the results were announced, in Jharkhand, BJP's alliance partner, the All Jharkhand Student's Union (AJSU) has decided to go solo after the two parties were unable to reach a seat-sharing arrangement.While Union minister and senior BJP leader, Rajnath Singh, has said the BJP will form a majority government in Jharkhand, observers have cast doubts over that possibility. In 2014, the BJP had won 37 seats while the AJSU had won five seats.NoneAJSU, led by Sudesh Mahto, has been the BJP's long-time ally, but Mahto is now highlighting that his party has really broken away from its alliance partner and that the two parties are not indulging in shadow-boxing. His contention, according to reports, is that his party has not been treated with respect by the BJP.Interestingly, that is also the reason why BJP's other two alliance partners in Bihar and at the Centre— JD(U) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)— decided to contest alone in Jharkhand.Apart from these, the worry within the BJP and for Das, reports suggest, is also that since the issue of abrogation of Article 370 did not seem to have worked for the party during the Haryana and Maharashtra polls, it won't have much of an effect during the Jharkhand polls either."

title,Have a 3-year-old car? Here is the motor own damage cover you may get soon
datetime,2019-11-26 15:06:00+00:00
description,IRDAI has suggested a lower level of depreciation for the vehicle. This means that car/bike owners may get a partially higher amount as insurance claim in case of total damage of the vehicle.
content,"The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) has proposed to make changes in the motor insurance own damage product. In its exposure draft, the insurance regulator has said that, for new cars upto three years, the sum insured will be the latest on-road vehicle price, manufacturer accessories, as well as road tax/registration.Upto the first three years, no depreciation will be applicable. After that, there will be a depreciation of 40-60 percent, depending on the age of the vehicle from above three years till the seventh year.This is among the multiple options given in the draft guidelines on how to decide on the motor own damage cover. Own damage cover is taken to protect the vehicle from physical damage. This is an optional cover.NoneTill now, a complicated formula called insured declared value has been used for deciding on the motor own damage cover. This would look at the price of he vehicle minus the depreciation. The older the vehicle, the lesser the insurance amount a vehicle owner gets in case of total damage of the car/bike.The level of depreciation has also been lowered in the exposure draft. This means you will get a partially-higher amount of insurance even if the vehicle is older.At present, the depreciation ranges from 5 percent for vehicles upto six months old to 50 percent for vehicles that are five years old.The IRDAI working group said that, beyond the seventh year, the sum-insured will be arrived at a mutually agreed value between the car-owner and insurer. The draft is based on the recommendations of a working group set up to look into motor own damage product structure.The idea of the working group is to make the process of motor own damage insurance simpler and claims settlement process easier.When it comes to commercial vehicles, the working group said that the sum-insured will be the current day invoice value plus cost of body building, if any, and all accessories fitted thereon by the manufacturer. This will be adjusted for depreciation at the rate of 10 percent per year till a maximum of 75 percent.NoneFor two-wheelers, the sum-insured will be 95 percent of the vehicle’s listed price till six months of the purchase. This will gradually go down to 90 percent till the bike is one-year-old and, finally, 40 percent once it is seven years old. Beyond the seventh year, the sum-insured will be arrived at a mutually-agreed value between the car owner and insurer.Apart from the above model, another standard model has also been mentioned as an option by the working group. Here, the sum-insured ranges from 95 percent of the car/bike’s current price when it less than six months old to 30 percent when it is 15 years old.NoneBased on the stakeholder feedback received, IRDAI will frame guidelines on the own damage product pricing post December 16.The working group has recommended a vehicle age-based depreciation for partial losses to make it completely objective and remove all ambiguity and subjectivity in claim settlement."

title,How Vishal Mehta undertook a journey from discretionary to system trading for consistent gains
datetime,2020-12-09 19:28:00+00:00
description,"Mental discipline, rather than technical analysis and strategies is the main challenge in becoming a successful trader. Vishal Mehta crossed that hurdle when he moved from discretionary to system trading. "
content,"Shishir AsthanaThere are few traders in the world as well-networked as Vishal Mehta. During his 15-year career as a trainer with Indian technical analysis software companies, and later with Reuters and Bloomberg, Vishal has met over 10,000 domestic and international traders.Mehta is a quintessential example of how difficult it is to become a trader. From being among the first 20 Chartered Market Technicians (CMT) in India to becoming the co-chair for the CMT Mumbai chapter, it took over a decade for him to become a successful trader.Passionate about technical analysis and trading, he can be seen networking at the Investor Carnival in Goa, with other traders.  His story exemplifies the fact that it is not only the knowledge of technical analysis that is important to be a good trader but the mental discipline to take blows and stand up to fight again in the market. Vishal’s turnaround took place when he decided to become a system trader from a discretionary one.A voracious reader, if you are looking for Vishal, is easy to find him at a cricket field. When in Mumbai, he never misses his Sunday cricket sessions with his society buddies.In this interview with Moneycontrol, Vishal Mehta talks about his learning from the market, his different stages of growth and trading style.Q: Vishal, you are an old hand in the market, how did you start your journey?NoneAfter completing my graduation in statistics in 2002 I had three career choices before me. Since I was a good cricket player I could have moved ahead with it professionally. I liked and still do like music and had a choice of becoming a DJ, and the third option was to join my father’s business.While I was still thinking through my plan,s my father informed me about a seminar in BSE on Technical Analysis. That seminar was my first exposure to markets after my childhood trips to the office. The first thing that I saw in the seminar was a price chart and like a child in a sweet shop, I was hooked to it.All I remember of the seminar is that if a stock is trading above a 200-day moving average (DMA) it is good and one that is below it has to be avoided.After the seminar, I did a little bit of probing of my own and concluded that if money can be made by trading from the charts, I might as well do it on an intra-day basis. My father introduced me to a sub-broker of ours who looked at intra-day charts for his trading. It is here I learnt more about technical analysis. I was fascinated with the software which was being used – Spider Software and thought of working with the company to get more insight into it.Since our broking business was not doing too well after the burst of the dotcom bubble, I decided to apply for a job there and managed to get it. From Spider Software, I moved to another company which was supply technical analysis package – Reliable Software. I worked for around one and a half year in these companies and might have met over 1,000 traders in India during this time.My job was to help build queries for these traders and provide support to the software. This interaction helped me a lot in understanding the psyche of a trader.While working in 2004 I was also trading with a sub-broker who was a perennial bear. He taught me to sell a stock on every rise. That was my first introduction to trading with a plan in place. However, the market was not right for shorting in 2004 as it was the start of a major bull run. The experience taught me risk-management, though not before I lost money in the market.This was also the time that my uncle gave me Rs 10 lakh to trade in the market which eventually resulted in my first biggest profit and then loss.I gradually accumulated 10,000 shares of UCO Bank in the price range of 22-25. This was the biggest position in the market I had ever taken. UCO Bank started moving up and touched a price of around 38-39. I was advised by fellow traders to exit, but my inexperience took the better of me and I told them back that I intended to buy the top end Maruti car from the winnings of this trade. I pegged my dreams to an unrealised profit. As you may have guessed, the stock soon started falling and in desperation, I sold it at Rs 14. The bottom of the chart on that fateful day was because of my trading.The trade made me realise that making big money is as easy as losing them. My journey of wins and losses continued. My Rs 10 lakh account went up to Rs 15 lakh, but in the end, it depleted substantially. I gave back the residual money to my uncle, the remaining amount later. Apart from trading losses, another reason for the drop in the capital was that I was a prolific spender. I used to spend a lot of the money that I made in the market.Soon, I realised this cannot go on for long. I needed a steady income and for that, I need to improve my resume. I joined an MS Finance course offered by ICFAI Hyderabad.My connection with the market continued while I was in Hyderabad. I had taken my laptop with me to check charts every day. I used to explain technical analysis to my batch mates. Dhaval Vyas, who later became an analyst, was my roommate, and he came up with interesting stock picks in those days. I remember many of his multi-baggers and his call of Unitech, which moved from Rs 30 to Rs 1,300.Looking at the charts of the stocks he recommended I saw that one thing was common among them. They all crossed an all-time high mark before starting on a new journey. To this day I use this important filter in my investment portfolio.Q: How was your second innings in the market?NoneBut it was during my stay in ILFS Investsmart where my first big profit was booked. There was a rumour about some activity in a company called Jai Corp. I immediately looked up the chart and found that it had made a new all-time high and met my criteria for buying.The stock was hitting the upper circuit every day and moved from Rs 300 to Rs 350. I kept my buying order and surprisingly, got a fill at around Rs 350.   The stock kept on moving higher to Rs 500 and I was on cloud nine. But then it started moving lower and went all the way to Rs 150. Since the position was of around Rs 15,000 (50 shares), I, like most new traders, moved the stock into the pile of 'short-term-trades-which-became-investments' and forgot about it.Then suddenly Jai Corp started making a meaningful presence in my portfolio. The stock again started moving higher and continued hitting the upper circuit. It touched an unadjusted price of Rs 15,000, becoming the highest gainer in Asia. At its peak, the stock in my portfolio was worth Rs 7.5 lakh.This was where I learnt another lesson from the market. Near the top, the company announced a big airport project near Navi Mumbai. The stock started falling from the top, which taught me that a stock can move without news and when the news comes you should be out. Unlike in the UCO Bank case, I managed to book a profit and exit at a value of around Rs 5-5.5 lakh.This incident also taught me the importance of risk and money management and the perils of having a concentrated bet.My career was also taking a turn for the good. I got a chance to work with Reuters. This gave me the chance to meet the institutional buy-side players likes bankers and corporates. What came to me as a surprise back then was everyone used charts and technical analysis, though they were not forthcoming about it.The training-and-support assignment with Reuters allowed me to train central bankers in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bangladesh.From Reuters, I moved to Bloomberg where I was the Chart Advocate for Asia and interacted with Asian traders. I was the link between what traders wanted on their charts and the central office. This offered me the opportunity to interact with thousands of traders across the globe and understand their way of thinking and approach to the market.During my tenure in Reuters and Bloomberg, I felt the need for further educating myself in technical analysis. I heard about this course called Chartered Market Technician (CMT) and completed it in 2006-07. I was among the first 20 CMTs in the country.Since not many people knew about CMT back then in India, I approached their head office in the US and after some deliberations, they decided to set up an office in India. Because of my network in the industry and thanks to my work experience, they asked me to be the chairperson. I was invited to the US along with a friend and had the opportunity to meet Gerald Appel, the founder of the technical indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Ralph Acampora, considered to be the grandfather of technical analysis.The Indian chapter of CMT recently organised, for the first time in the country, the annual summit of CMT where world-renowned technical analysts like Martin Pring, Ralph Acampora and JC Parets came to the country.Q: How have you progressed as a trader?NoneThankfully I am a voracious reader. I came across two books – Stock market edges by Philip Reschke and Short term strategies that work by Larry Connors. The books talked about quantitative edges, which was contrary to what I had seen or read.Most of the traders in the market buy a breakout or buy above the high of a green candle (bullish candle). I, however, buy at a red candle (bearish candle), but one which is nearing the end of the bear move. This gives me the opportunity of buying fear and selling greed. By the time the chart shows a green candle and other traders enter their position I am already out of the trade.This systematic strategy is best explained in Larry Connors book where he talks of the 2 periods RSI (Relative Strength Index) strategy with proper entry and exit rules.NoneWhat the books taught me was that you need to find edges in trading. The edges may be small, but they offer better than a 50-50 chance of winning. If I can position size these edges properly, I would, in the long run, turn out to be a winner.The issue in front of me now was implementation. I was tired of being a discretionary trader and wanted to be a systematic trader now that I had a set of well-defined rules to trade. I liked the system approach as individual trades did not affect my ego. In discretionary trading, a few stop losses would rattle me.Connors' strategy was back-tested in the US markets and was working well. But I needed to run these strategies in the Indian market and test them by considering all parameters including position sizing, size of the portfolio among numerous other variables.I tried hunting for a programmer in India who could do it but could not find one who could include all the variables. Finally, I reached out to Larry Connors’ programmer Matt Radtke in the US and hired his services. Thanks to my job in Bloomberg and Reuters I could afford to do it.I backtested around 25 strategies and am live with only two strategies. Because the backtesting result was strong I am relaxed and confident of them. The 2 period RSI strategy gave me a return of 45 percent last year.Consistency in my returns came only after I converted from being a discretionary trader to a system trader.Q: Can you describe your trading strategy?NoneAfter we get the list of stocks that meet all the criteria we sort them based on ROC. Higher the ROC better is the chance of mean reversion. The top 10 stocks that make the list forms the trading universe.The next morning our program places a trade in all the stocks at a level of 1 percent above the previous close. Stop loss for our trades are above 3 percent above our short selling price. Our target is six percent.NoneThe chart of Biocon explains the strategy where the second last big green candle on the daily chart was our trigger. The intraday chart shows our entry and exit.NoneOut of the 10 stocks that we short one or two may be stopped out, some may not be triggered while others may be profitable. In our backtesting, we have found out that 80 percent of breakouts fail.NoneI buy the Bank Nifty future if it crosses the previous day high by a certain percent and sells it if it breaks below the previous day low by some percent. We book a profit at two percent and keep our stop loss at 0.5 percent. There is no trailing stop loss as backtesting results have proven that trailing in intraday does not work.This strategy has given me a return of 30 percent last year.My long term plan is to use as much artificial intelligence in my trading and bond with like-minded traders to jointly develop strategies. I intend to develop more option strategies and try to convert Larry Connors strategies into options strategies.Apart from trading I also have an investment strategy where the trading profits are deployed. Trading is a very stressful profession and it pays to have an investment portfolio.I still like to buy stocks that are at their all-time highs and do not bend the rule. I follow the maxim that no position is a good position. But now I have added a new criteria’s using William O’Neal’s CANSLIM strategy.I have started building my portfolio recently and thanks to the market in the last two months it has given a 10 percent return. The best stock for me has been Affle India, which has given a 63 percent return in 10 months but not before stopping me out four times.Here I would like to add a note for all budding traders who are developing a strategy that they need to think of the inherent characteristics of the instrument you are using to build a strategy.Say for example if you want to develop a volatility breakout strategy it would be better to test and trade it on Bank Nifty rather than Nifty. Similarly, a non-direction option strategy will perform better in Nifty.Q: You have been training in technical analysis and trading strategies long before the current breed of trainers came in. There is a lot of controversy in social media around training. Where are the fault lines?NoneMy limited point is that while it helps if an established trader is a trainer but that is not the necessary condition. It is not so in most other fields. Coaches need not be good players.In any case when one is paying a hefty fee to attend a training session, one should do the due-diligence beforehand rather than crib after attending the conference.The problem is many attendees come to these trading sessions with the mindset of making as much money as the trainer, if not more, from the moment they step out of the training session.This might have been said many times before, but it needs to be reiterated that a strategy is only a small portion of a trader’s success. Money and risk management, coupled with discipline and a strong mental make-up, constitutes the major chunk.Despite me being a trainer for so many years and interacting with world-class trainers, it took me years to be a consistent trader. I still attend many training sessions with other trainers. I might have easily spent over Rs 15 lakh in attending these sessions.But I go in with the intention of not learning the strategy from the trainer, but to get one pearl of wisdom which can enhance my strategy. In most cases, it has been a fruitful experience."

title,Equity-oriented mutual funds: What is equity-oriented fund and how does it work?
datetime,2019-11-25 12:58:00+00:00
description,The equity-oriented fund is a type of mutual fund scheme that invests mainly in equity stocks. Click here to know the various types of equity-oriented mutual funds based on market capitalization & how does it work.
content,"Mutual funds are one of the most common avenues of investment these days. In a mutual fund, investors who have a common investment objective pool in their investment money in a fund. The fund manager uses the pooled in money for investments in a variety of market instruments or other securities. The investors own a unit of mutual fund. Returns generated from the investment are distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting applicable expenses and levies.A type of mutual fund scheme that invests predominantly in equity stocks is called an equity-oriented fund. As per the regulations of SEBI, an equity mutual fund scheme must invest at least 65 percent of the scheme’s assets in equities and equity-related instruments. The chief objective of these funds is to provide capital appreciation over a medium to long term investment horizon.These funds are very popular amongst retail investors among various categories of mutual fund products. However, equity-oriented mutual funds are more prone to market volatility as major of the investment is in equity.As stated above, these funds invest at least 60 percent of their assets in equity shares of companies in varying proportions in consonance with the investment objective. The balance amount is invested in debt and money market instruments to provide a corpus for redemption requests and reduce the risk. The type of equity funds can vary large-cap, mid-cap, or small-cap funds or a mixture of market capitalization.These schemes provide different options to the investors like dividend option, growth, etc and the investment can be either value-oriented or growth-oriented. The investor is free to choose an option depending on their preferences. The equity-oriented mutual fund also allows the investors to change the options at a later date. These schemes work very well for investors who have a long-term outlook and seek appreciation over a period of time.Investment in an equity-oriented fund can be done by the investor directly through the website of the mutual fund house or through a distributor or agent. The mode of investment can be via SIPs or lump sum investments. The investment corpus is reinvested in a range of equity options across various sectors. The returns from this scheme depend on the performance of these equities. Investors usually aim for a more diversified portfolio that reduces the negative effect of an individual stock's adverse price movement on the overall portfolio and on the share price of the equity fund. The price of the equity fund is determined on the basis of the fund's net asset value (NAV) less than its liabilities.Equity oriented mutual fund is managed by portfolio managers. This includes the day to day management of the fund and deciding when the equity should be bought or sold, keeping in mind the specific investment objectives. The portfolio manager uses his professional judgment and analytical research to make these decisions.The management of these funds can be active or passive. In a fund where the portfolio manager actively manages the fund, the ultimate aim is to generate maximum returns for the investors. In return, the fund house levies a small fee which is deducted from the investment. The fees charged by mutual funds are regulated and have to be within certain limits imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In contrast, a passively managed fund simply follows a market index, i.e., in a passive fund. The fund manager remains inactive or passive and does not use its judgment to decide as to which stocks should be bought or sold. The main objective remains to replicate or track the benchmark index of the scheme.There are various types of equity mutual fund schemes which are differentiated on the basis of underlying portfolio and levels of market risk. The common types of equity-oriented mutual funds on the basis of market capitalization are:NoneNoneNoneNoneHere are the key benefits of investing in such a fund:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneThe taxation of a mutual fund is an important aspect that affects the investment decision. Most investors would like to invest in schemes that offer them tax benefits. In the case of mutual funds, a differential rate of taxation applies to investment across various fund categories. The applicable tax rate depends on the type of mutual fund and the holding period.There are two aspects of the taxation of an equity-oriented mutual fund: dividends and capital gains. Dividend refers to the return generated by a particular fund. A capital gain is a difference between the value at which an investor purchased the units of a mutual fund scheme and the value at which the units were sold or redeemed. There are two types of capital gains tax as per the investment tenure: long term capital gains and short term capital gains.At present, Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) at 10 percent is paid on all the dividends from equity mutual funds. The investor's in-hand receipt of the dividend is reduced by the extent of DDT.The holding period of mutual fund units can either be short-term or long-term. In the case of equity mutual funds, a holding period of 12 months or more is regarded as long-term. So, long-term capital gains tax or LTCG applies to those investments. The present rate of LTCG tax is 10 percent.Equity funds are regarded as short-term investments if the holding period is less than 12 months. In such a case, short term capital gains tax or STCG is applicable. The present rate of STCG tax is 15 percent.A Securities Transaction Tax (STT) of 0.001 percent has to be paid on equity-oriented mutual funds at the time of redemption of units. The STT is not paid separately as it is deducted from the mutual fund returns.Equity Linked Saving Scheme, which is an equity-oriented fund, is the only pure equity investment that offers tax benefits up to INR 1.5 lakh in a financial year under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. ELSS which provides long term capital gains above INR 1 lakh is taxed at 10 percent. LTCG over Rs 1 lakh is taxable at the rate of 10 percent without the benefit of indexation. Additionally, the mutual fund has to pay a dividend distribution tax of 10 percent on dividends declared under ELSS resulting in a reduced dividend. However, ELSS has a lock-in period of three years. You cannot redeem your units before the completion of three years.It is critical for an investor to understand the product completely before making an investment. Any unplanned exists should be made only after considering the tax liability. It is best to resist the temptation of making frequent redemptions without considering the tax implications. If you are unsure about your decision, make sure that you seek the advice of an investment adviser and also explain your investment objective.Before making any investment decision, an investor should take into account his risk-taking capacity, age factor, financial position, etc. Different types of mutual fund schemes invest in a different type of securities. So it important to fully read the offer documents to understand the benefits and risks associated with a type of product. It is always advisable to not park all your investment in one type of scheme. Diversification is important but the quantum should be decided as per your investment objectives. If you are a new investor, you can consult a financial expert before taking decisions.The amount of investment in ELSS depends on several factors. You would need to take into account other investments already committed such as PPF, EPF, insurance, etc. You also need to take into account the investment objective and the investment horizon you are looking at. If you are a young investor, you may want to invest up to the limit of INR 1 lakh for getting the tax benefits and not invest in any other instrument. However, if you are an experienced investor, you may want to diversify your investment by investing in a couple of different products.Load refers to the charge collected by a mutual fund when the units are sold. There are two types of loads: entry load and exit load. Entry load is levied when the investor buys a unit whereas exit load applied when the units are sold by the investor. At present, SEBI has mandated that no entry load can be charged by any mutual fund scheme. The exit load charged is credited to the scheme.No scheme is allowed to increase the exit load beyond the level mentioned in the offer document. Any change in the load will be only for future investments and not to investments made earlier. If fresh loads are applicable or increased, the mutual funds are required to amend their offer documents so that the new investors are aware of loads at the time of investments.The investors should take the loads into consideration while making the investment as these affect their returns.ASBA is a facility provided by banks to investors in new fund offers (NFOs) of mutual funds. If you apply for an NFO via ASBA, the application amount gets blocked in your bank account. While the amount stays in your account, it cannot be used until you are allotted the unit of a mutual fund."

title,How Vishal Mehta undertook a journey from discretionary to system trading for consistent gains
datetime,2020-12-09 19:28:00+00:00
description,"Mental discipline, rather than technical analysis and strategies is the main challenge in becoming a successful trader. Vishal Mehta crossed that hurdle when he moved from discretionary to system trading. "
content,"Shishir AsthanaThere are few traders in the world as well-networked as Vishal Mehta. During his 15-year career as a trainer with Indian technical analysis software companies, and later with Reuters and Bloomberg, Vishal has met over 10,000 domestic and international traders.Mehta is a quintessential example of how difficult it is to become a trader. From being among the first 20 Chartered Market Technicians (CMT) in India to becoming the co-chair for the CMT Mumbai chapter, it took over a decade for him to become a successful trader.Passionate about technical analysis and trading, he can be seen networking at the Investor Carnival in Goa, with other traders.  His story exemplifies the fact that it is not only the knowledge of technical analysis that is important to be a good trader but the mental discipline to take blows and stand up to fight again in the market. Vishal’s turnaround took place when he decided to become a system trader from a discretionary one.A voracious reader, if you are looking for Vishal, is easy to find him at a cricket field. When in Mumbai, he never misses his Sunday cricket sessions with his society buddies.In this interview with Moneycontrol, Vishal Mehta talks about his learning from the market, his different stages of growth and trading style.Q: Vishal, you are an old hand in the market, how did you start your journey?NoneAfter completing my graduation in statistics in 2002 I had three career choices before me. Since I was a good cricket player I could have moved ahead with it professionally. I liked and still do like music and had a choice of becoming a DJ, and the third option was to join my father’s business.While I was still thinking through my plan,s my father informed me about a seminar in BSE on Technical Analysis. That seminar was my first exposure to markets after my childhood trips to the office. The first thing that I saw in the seminar was a price chart and like a child in a sweet shop, I was hooked to it.All I remember of the seminar is that if a stock is trading above a 200-day moving average (DMA) it is good and one that is below it has to be avoided.After the seminar, I did a little bit of probing of my own and concluded that if money can be made by trading from the charts, I might as well do it on an intra-day basis. My father introduced me to a sub-broker of ours who looked at intra-day charts for his trading. It is here I learnt more about technical analysis. I was fascinated with the software which was being used – Spider Software and thought of working with the company to get more insight into it.Since our broking business was not doing too well after the burst of the dotcom bubble, I decided to apply for a job there and managed to get it. From Spider Software, I moved to another company which was supply technical analysis package – Reliable Software. I worked for around one and a half year in these companies and might have met over 1,000 traders in India during this time.My job was to help build queries for these traders and provide support to the software. This interaction helped me a lot in understanding the psyche of a trader.While working in 2004 I was also trading with a sub-broker who was a perennial bear. He taught me to sell a stock on every rise. That was my first introduction to trading with a plan in place. However, the market was not right for shorting in 2004 as it was the start of a major bull run. The experience taught me risk-management, though not before I lost money in the market.This was also the time that my uncle gave me Rs 10 lakh to trade in the market which eventually resulted in my first biggest profit and then loss.I gradually accumulated 10,000 shares of UCO Bank in the price range of 22-25. This was the biggest position in the market I had ever taken. UCO Bank started moving up and touched a price of around 38-39. I was advised by fellow traders to exit, but my inexperience took the better of me and I told them back that I intended to buy the top end Maruti car from the winnings of this trade. I pegged my dreams to an unrealised profit. As you may have guessed, the stock soon started falling and in desperation, I sold it at Rs 14. The bottom of the chart on that fateful day was because of my trading.The trade made me realise that making big money is as easy as losing them. My journey of wins and losses continued. My Rs 10 lakh account went up to Rs 15 lakh, but in the end, it depleted substantially. I gave back the residual money to my uncle, the remaining amount later. Apart from trading losses, another reason for the drop in the capital was that I was a prolific spender. I used to spend a lot of the money that I made in the market.Soon, I realised this cannot go on for long. I needed a steady income and for that, I need to improve my resume. I joined an MS Finance course offered by ICFAI Hyderabad.My connection with the market continued while I was in Hyderabad. I had taken my laptop with me to check charts every day. I used to explain technical analysis to my batch mates. Dhaval Vyas, who later became an analyst, was my roommate, and he came up with interesting stock picks in those days. I remember many of his multi-baggers and his call of Unitech, which moved from Rs 30 to Rs 1,300.Looking at the charts of the stocks he recommended I saw that one thing was common among them. They all crossed an all-time high mark before starting on a new journey. To this day I use this important filter in my investment portfolio.Q: How was your second innings in the market?NoneBut it was during my stay in ILFS Investsmart where my first big profit was booked. There was a rumour about some activity in a company called Jai Corp. I immediately looked up the chart and found that it had made a new all-time high and met my criteria for buying.The stock was hitting the upper circuit every day and moved from Rs 300 to Rs 350. I kept my buying order and surprisingly, got a fill at around Rs 350.   The stock kept on moving higher to Rs 500 and I was on cloud nine. But then it started moving lower and went all the way to Rs 150. Since the position was of around Rs 15,000 (50 shares), I, like most new traders, moved the stock into the pile of 'short-term-trades-which-became-investments' and forgot about it.Then suddenly Jai Corp started making a meaningful presence in my portfolio. The stock again started moving higher and continued hitting the upper circuit. It touched an unadjusted price of Rs 15,000, becoming the highest gainer in Asia. At its peak, the stock in my portfolio was worth Rs 7.5 lakh.This was where I learnt another lesson from the market. Near the top, the company announced a big airport project near Navi Mumbai. The stock started falling from the top, which taught me that a stock can move without news and when the news comes you should be out. Unlike in the UCO Bank case, I managed to book a profit and exit at a value of around Rs 5-5.5 lakh.This incident also taught me the importance of risk and money management and the perils of having a concentrated bet.My career was also taking a turn for the good. I got a chance to work with Reuters. This gave me the chance to meet the institutional buy-side players likes bankers and corporates. What came to me as a surprise back then was everyone used charts and technical analysis, though they were not forthcoming about it.The training-and-support assignment with Reuters allowed me to train central bankers in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bangladesh.From Reuters, I moved to Bloomberg where I was the Chart Advocate for Asia and interacted with Asian traders. I was the link between what traders wanted on their charts and the central office. This offered me the opportunity to interact with thousands of traders across the globe and understand their way of thinking and approach to the market.During my tenure in Reuters and Bloomberg, I felt the need for further educating myself in technical analysis. I heard about this course called Chartered Market Technician (CMT) and completed it in 2006-07. I was among the first 20 CMTs in the country.Since not many people knew about CMT back then in India, I approached their head office in the US and after some deliberations, they decided to set up an office in India. Because of my network in the industry and thanks to my work experience, they asked me to be the chairperson. I was invited to the US along with a friend and had the opportunity to meet Gerald Appel, the founder of the technical indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Ralph Acampora, considered to be the grandfather of technical analysis.The Indian chapter of CMT recently organised, for the first time in the country, the annual summit of CMT where world-renowned technical analysts like Martin Pring, Ralph Acampora and JC Parets came to the country.Q: How have you progressed as a trader?NoneThankfully I am a voracious reader. I came across two books – Stock market edges by Philip Reschke and Short term strategies that work by Larry Connors. The books talked about quantitative edges, which was contrary to what I had seen or read.Most of the traders in the market buy a breakout or buy above the high of a green candle (bullish candle). I, however, buy at a red candle (bearish candle), but one which is nearing the end of the bear move. This gives me the opportunity of buying fear and selling greed. By the time the chart shows a green candle and other traders enter their position I am already out of the trade.This systematic strategy is best explained in Larry Connors book where he talks of the 2 periods RSI (Relative Strength Index) strategy with proper entry and exit rules.NoneWhat the books taught me was that you need to find edges in trading. The edges may be small, but they offer better than a 50-50 chance of winning. If I can position size these edges properly, I would, in the long run, turn out to be a winner.The issue in front of me now was implementation. I was tired of being a discretionary trader and wanted to be a systematic trader now that I had a set of well-defined rules to trade. I liked the system approach as individual trades did not affect my ego. In discretionary trading, a few stop losses would rattle me.Connors' strategy was back-tested in the US markets and was working well. But I needed to run these strategies in the Indian market and test them by considering all parameters including position sizing, size of the portfolio among numerous other variables.I tried hunting for a programmer in India who could do it but could not find one who could include all the variables. Finally, I reached out to Larry Connors’ programmer Matt Radtke in the US and hired his services. Thanks to my job in Bloomberg and Reuters I could afford to do it.I backtested around 25 strategies and am live with only two strategies. Because the backtesting result was strong I am relaxed and confident of them. The 2 period RSI strategy gave me a return of 45 percent last year.Consistency in my returns came only after I converted from being a discretionary trader to a system trader.Q: Can you describe your trading strategy?NoneAfter we get the list of stocks that meet all the criteria we sort them based on ROC. Higher the ROC better is the chance of mean reversion. The top 10 stocks that make the list forms the trading universe.The next morning our program places a trade in all the stocks at a level of 1 percent above the previous close. Stop loss for our trades are above 3 percent above our short selling price. Our target is six percent.NoneThe chart of Biocon explains the strategy where the second last big green candle on the daily chart was our trigger. The intraday chart shows our entry and exit.NoneOut of the 10 stocks that we short one or two may be stopped out, some may not be triggered while others may be profitable. In our backtesting, we have found out that 80 percent of breakouts fail.NoneI buy the Bank Nifty future if it crosses the previous day high by a certain percent and sells it if it breaks below the previous day low by some percent. We book a profit at two percent and keep our stop loss at 0.5 percent. There is no trailing stop loss as backtesting results have proven that trailing in intraday does not work.This strategy has given me a return of 30 percent last year.My long term plan is to use as much artificial intelligence in my trading and bond with like-minded traders to jointly develop strategies. I intend to develop more option strategies and try to convert Larry Connors strategies into options strategies.Apart from trading I also have an investment strategy where the trading profits are deployed. Trading is a very stressful profession and it pays to have an investment portfolio.I still like to buy stocks that are at their all-time highs and do not bend the rule. I follow the maxim that no position is a good position. But now I have added a new criteria’s using William O’Neal’s CANSLIM strategy.I have started building my portfolio recently and thanks to the market in the last two months it has given a 10 percent return. The best stock for me has been Affle India, which has given a 63 percent return in 10 months but not before stopping me out four times.Here I would like to add a note for all budding traders who are developing a strategy that they need to think of the inherent characteristics of the instrument you are using to build a strategy.Say for example if you want to develop a volatility breakout strategy it would be better to test and trade it on Bank Nifty rather than Nifty. Similarly, a non-direction option strategy will perform better in Nifty.Q: You have been training in technical analysis and trading strategies long before the current breed of trainers came in. There is a lot of controversy in social media around training. Where are the fault lines?NoneMy limited point is that while it helps if an established trader is a trainer but that is not the necessary condition. It is not so in most other fields. Coaches need not be good players.In any case when one is paying a hefty fee to attend a training session, one should do the due-diligence beforehand rather than crib after attending the conference.The problem is many attendees come to these trading sessions with the mindset of making as much money as the trainer, if not more, from the moment they step out of the training session.This might have been said many times before, but it needs to be reiterated that a strategy is only a small portion of a trader’s success. Money and risk management, coupled with discipline and a strong mental make-up, constitutes the major chunk.Despite me being a trainer for so many years and interacting with world-class trainers, it took me years to be a consistent trader. I still attend many training sessions with other trainers. I might have easily spent over Rs 15 lakh in attending these sessions.But I go in with the intention of not learning the strategy from the trainer, but to get one pearl of wisdom which can enhance my strategy. In most cases, it has been a fruitful experience."

title,Inverse Head & Shoulder Pattern suggests buying PNB
datetime,2019-12-02 10:35:00+00:00
description,Punjab National Bank is trading in an up move while forming inverse head & shoulders pattern and this emerging pattern will be completed on a close above Rs 67.75 marks.
content,"Shabbir KayyumiIn technical analysis, an inverse head and shoulder (H&S) pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. An inverse head and shoulder reversal pattern forms after a downtrend, and its completion marks a trend reversal to uptrend.Patterns are an integral part of technical analysis, but successful traders combine these techniques with technical indicators and other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of success.In the standard inverse head and shoulders pattern, we connect the high after the left shoulder with the high created after the head. A trend line is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called as “Neckline"". This trend line is the most important component of the inverse H&S pattern.NoneNoneThis stock is trading near a strong resistance line standing around Rs 67.75 levels, which is tested multiple times earlier, also suggesting a strong bullish bias to continue further after a breakout.The recent formation of inverse H&S classical pattern will give a breakout by trading only above the Rs 67.75 mark, which suggests buying in the stock for higher target of Rs 79. The volume will also add further insight while trading these patterns. Decent volume participation, while giving breakout will also give support to the inverse H& S pattern.Buy signal:-4. Decent volume participation while the pattern breaks out will also give additional confirmation.Profit Booking:-The target as per inverse H&S pattern is calculated by adding height of head (H) to neckline which comes to 79. However one can book profits near the previous swing high, which is around Rs 77 levels.Stop loss:-Entire bullish view negates the breaching of right shoulder on a closing basis, and one should exit from the long position. In the case of PNB, it is placed around the Rs 62 level.ConclusionWe recommend buying Punjab National Bank (PNB) above Rs 67.75 level with a stop loss of Rs 62 for higher targets of Rs 79 as indicated in the above chart.(The Author is Head - Technical & Derivative Research, Narnolia Financial Advisors.)"

So when a top recruiter asked candidates to focus on the ‘job-role’ rather than ‘cost-to-company’ (CTC), this opened a can of worms.When an organisation is in the lookout of good talent, it is a given that they must be ready to provide adequate compensation. Hence it is crucial that they also mention compensation details while advertising for a job. This will not just be an attractive proposition to get good candidates but also leave the need for prospective employees to seek details later.The negotiations on the compensations could be a secondary process, but at least the candidates have a base to start from.A Bangalore-based technology company providing IT software services has a peculiar strategy while hiring talent. They seek the present compensation details but keep the candidate in suspense till the eleventh hour. The company promises a 35 percent flat hike at the start, but slowly comes down to less than 20 percent over the various stages. This not only breaks down potential job-role negotiations, but is also unfair to the individuals seeking a job.Their justification is that they ‘test’ candidates to see how interested they are in the job position. But according to HR officials this has only impacted their employer brand.Terms like ‘on par with industry standards’, ‘confidential’ or ‘better than competitors’ are used on professional networking sites or jobs platforms. But for the applicants, these terms mean nothing. Giving an indicative compensation figure is a much better option. A cursory check on most job sites shows that less than 10 percent of the advertised jobs have the compensation mentioned.The most common reasons given by employers to not list salaries is they get more negotiating power on one hand and also give them an upper hand against competition. For instance, if company A and company B are looking for a data scientist, A giving out salary details might mean that B will try to offer a higher CTC to lure candidates.But for applicants, no information on salary structure would mean that he/she has no incentive to apply for a role that fits their work experience.At a time when finding skilled talent is becoming increasingly difficult in the Indian market, disclosing approximate salary details at the time of advertising vacancies has become a requirement. Companies which decide not to, only end up missing out on qualified resources in the market."

title,FMCG companies aim for 100% recyclable plastic packaging by 2025

description,Most FMCG companies are taking initiatives to reduce collect and recycle multi-layered plastic
content,"The government has launched several projects to increase awareness around plastic recycling and curb the negative environmental impact of plastic waste.Aligned with the national agenda on plastic waste management, several FMCG companies are working aggressively towards using 100 percent biodegradable plastic for packaging ready-to-eat and cosmetic products.NoneThe move comes in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to shun the usage of single-use plastic which may curb the use of items such as plastic spoons, 200 ml PET bottles, plastic straws, cups, plastic packets, among others.Plastic containers of all types shed layers called microns in daily usage. These are insoluble compounds depositing as toxins in human body cells, in the environment and are carcinogenic beyond a limit.Hindustan Unilever is working with the government and other partners such as the United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.""At Unilever, we are committed to moving to 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025, said a spokesperson from HUL.Recently, HUL also announced two new commitments -- Reduce our use of virgin plastic packaging by 50 percent by 2025, with one third coming from an absolute plastic reduction and help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.""We continually look at new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle and recover packaging and waste as we move towards becoming a zero-waste business. Globally, we have reduced nearly one-third of our packaging waste since 2010. We are committed to accelerating a transition to a circular economy, moving from the linear take-make-dispose model to a regenerative approach, which keeps materials at their highest value for as long as possible,"" HUL spokesperson added.Single-use plastics are majorly used for packaging in FMCG packets and sachets of packed foods, groceries, cosmetics and toiletries.Most FMCG companies are taking initiatives to reduce, collect and recycle multi-layered plastic.Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for beverage products are being re-purposed to make apparels, footwear, and furniture by many companies.At an industry event recently, Marico Chairman Harsh Mariwala said, “We will be moving to 100 percent recyclable plastic usage by 2025 and we will be using recycled content in packaging.”Early November, Marico, in line with its commitment to sustainability, announced its partnership with Future Retail’s format Big Bazaar to launch a plastic recycling program ‘Plastic Lao Paise Kamao’.The program enables consumers to submit plastic bottles across 21 key Big Bazaar outlets in and around Mumbai.For each bottle that is submitted, Marico in association with Future Retail offers Rs 10 to consumers, which is instantly credited to their Future Pay wallet and can be redeemed against their purchase.The incentive provided is for all products of Marico and also for products of Future Consumer, irrespective of the size of the bottle.Other FMCG companies, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle too will move to 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025.None“Dabur India has set its sights on becoming a Plastic Waste Neutral company by the end of March 2021 by collecting, processing and recycling 20,000 MT (20 million kgs) of post-consumer plastic waste from across the country. With this, the company would be collecting back 100 percent of the plastic waste that it generates through its product packaging, making it amongst the first Indian FMCG companies to achieve this feat,” said Shahrukh Khan, Executive Director-Operations, Dabur India.Dabur has already rolled out a pilot plastic recycling initiative in 2018-19 in six states.The fiscal year 2018-19 was the first full year of its roll-out and we have collected, processed and recycled nearly 4,000 MT (four million Kgs) of post-consumer plastic waste from these six states, Khan said.It covers both recyclables (like PET, HDPE, beverage cartons) and non-recyclables (multi-layered plastic). The six states initially targeted by Dabur are Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.Dabur India has now extended this Plastic Waste Management initiative to 25 states in 2019-20 fiscal and the company will collect 12,400 MT (124 lakh kg) plastic waste and send them for recycling/processing.“This would be further hiked to 20,000 MT (200 lakh kgs) in 2020-21. With this, we would collect back 100% of the plastic waste generated by our packaging by March 2021, making us a Plastic Waste Neutral company,” Khan said.Coca-Cola is redesigning and light-weighting packaging, increasing renewable and recycled material use. HUL is working with the government and other partners such as the United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.PepsiCo India has been working across states to collect, segregate and sustainably manage the equivalent of 100 percent plastic packaging by 2021. It has partnered with organisations to upcycle plastic into creating utility products such as chairs, benches, tables, t-shirts, laptop bags.NoneNone""We are exploring a non-plastic based structure with coatings for a smaller sachet of solid products and experimenting with nearly Zero Base Packaging Concept during the year through the pilot,"" a company spokesperson said. They are also working on replacing glass with plastic bottles in selective products in food to reduce the Carbon footprint.Parle Agro has also tied up with key players such as PET - Packaging Association for Clean Environment (PACE) and Action Alliance for Recycling Beverage Cartons (AARC) towards implementing its PWM initiatives.“We have set an ambitious goal to immediately become 100 percent PET waste free company. This not only requires us to accelerate many of our ongoing environment and sustainability initiatives, but also double our investments. We are committed to invest Rs 50 crores in the next three years towards this endeavor,"" said Nadia Chauhan, Joint Managing Director and Chief Marketing Officer, Parle Agro.""Given our 30 percent growth rate, our ‘PET Sustainability’ investments will most definitely increase every year. Moreover, in the coming months we will be launching additional employee and consumer campaigns that will act as a multiplier for our PWM initiatives,"" she added.Even chocolate makers are making use of upcycled papers for wrapping chocolates.Launched in Amsterdam and produced in Chennai, Kocoatrait chocolate bars are packed using our cocoa husk paper which is upcycled, plastic & paper-free, recyclable, biodegradable & compostable.According to government data, India generates more than 25,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, 40 percent of which remains uncollected and littered in the environment.The government aims to rid the country of single-use plastic by 2022 as part of the Clean India (Swachh Bharat) part two campaign."

description,"Once perceived as an open, permissionless age of information and communication, Internet has evolved into a network pervaded by pockets of centralized and closed systems to capture value - often with overlooked and adverse consequences. Here's how Blockchain is changing all of that."
content,"Mr. Zac CheahInternet usage and its different aspects have insinuated a lot of conversation globally where centralized service providers control over personal/regional Internet access and data storage are seen as a problem in many areas of the world. Surfing the Internet is not as private as once perceived it would be, and large service providers dominate everything from content, personal data usage as well as the sharing economy.Internet, once perceived as an open, permissionless age of information and communication, has evolved into a network pervaded by pockets of centralized and closed systems to capture value - often with overlooked and adverse consequences. However, that is slowly changing with the advent of Blockchain technology. Blockchain invokes privacy and decentralization.Need for a Blockchain EcosystemBy establishing channels of communication with blockchain technology, one has vested responsibility to a vast, distributed network taken care of by cryptograph and controlled by no one to ensure that messages are sent securely. This means individuals and businesses, not centralized intermediaries have control over how their information is shared and with whom.A blockchain ecosystem can strike the balance of how the internet is currently run, returning powers and rights to consumers. The implementation of a decentralized network shifts the internet from a system where dominant interests control and filter communication to one in which all participants contribute to distribute information and have equal rights to do so.Evolution of Decentralized appsBlockchain has a wide range of applications and almost any field can benefit from having such a technology at its disposal. Developing applications on blockchain is certainly something that is new and cutting edge – in fact, there is a new word to describe the type of applications that are powered by blockchain. These are called Decentralized Applications or DApps.Decentralization offers wide benefits for conducting business especially in a world where the applications for doing business and exchanging services are decentralized. Decentralized applications, by contrast, are controlled by no single entity. They allow consumers, businesses and other content creators to connect directly, cutting out the middlemen and changing the terms on which business is done across industries. At present many apps extract value not just from generous commission structures but also from users’ data or by imposing terms on content creators’ copyright. Decentralized applications grant this power entirely to users.India stands sixth on the list of patents and trends in the blockchain space. Blockchain has found its way into the Indian Fintech ecosystem and is making its presence felt in profound ways. Many said RBI’s decision marked the end of blockchain in India, a technology that is being widely adopted everywhere. But, nothing could have been further from the truth. Uncharacteristically enough, state governments began to champion blockchain use cases beyond crypto. Today, blockchain is in focus with the advent of decentralised applications (dapps) and networks.Future of DecentralizationDecentralization has given birth to a next-generation internet service framework which has the ability to improve the existing internet and blockchain architecture, combining the benefits of both worlds and using the most commonly-used technical solutions.Revelations of government surveillance, third-party data impropriety, and a renewed vigor in privacy and decentralization, initiatives are pushing forward towards a more permissionless and decentralized Internet.It enables swift migration of businesses onto the blockchain service network, and allows each developer and user to have absolute control over their own data, thus effectively removing barriers between two parties.Lately, one has witnessed a lot of innovation leading from the blockchain technology and it is only expected to grow. Blockchain powered phones have already seen the light of day wherein the consumers control the data, allowing them to make phone calls, send messages, share files and browse the internet in ways that are entirely encrypted and secure and independent of centralized carriers.Other companies have sought to capitalize on growing consumer preference for privacy, blockchain-based and cryptographically secure communication through the release of so-called blockchain phones, which primarily employ secure blockchain wallets promising users the chance to hold cryptocurrencies in their mobile devices securely. The blockchain powered phones stand as a unique example for using distributed ledger technology to extend the uses and benefits of blockchain to telephony, messaging and digital communication of all kinds."

title,Will LIC be the white knight of disinvestments?
datetime,2019-11-29 14:39:00+00:00
description,"Being the largest institutional investor in the country, LIC is a prominent participant in the divestment process of government entities. "
content,"The government announced disinvestments in five public sector undertakings (PSUs) after the approval of Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs. However, the bigger question here is whether Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will play the white knight in this divestment process.Being the largest institutional investor in the country, LIC is a prominent participant in the divestment process of government entities. LIC prefers investing in entities that have a long-term growth horizon (10-15 years) since their insurance products are also long term in nature.""It is anticipated that LIC will play a key role since it has adequate appetite for these instruments,"" said an official.NoneTypically, LIC invests between Rs 50,000 crore to 55,000 crore in equities. While LIC maintains that it invests only in instruments based on a strategic call, it is a fact that the insurer has helped key divestments sail through.NoneDisinvestmentsNoneNoneThis is part of the planned activity of the finance ministry that has set a target of Rs 1.05 lakh for 2019-20 as the divestment target. Of this, the centre has received only Rs 13,000 crore so far including the recent IPO of IRCTC.""It is a tough market and the divestment target is high. Large institutions like LIC will have to step in to help bridge the gap,"" added a senior ministry official.NoneNoneIn the April to October period, LIC outdid most of the competition, with new premium growth of 37.7 percent YoY at Rs 1.01 lakh crore.Since the equity investments are made out of the policyholder's funds, a rise in new premium collection also means good news for the stock market investments by LIC."

content,"None""Cipla is in pole position currently and is leading the race to buy a clutch of Wockhardt's business divisions, which have been put on the block,"" one of the sources cited above said. Explaining the rationale for the deal, another source added, ""Cipla can achieve further scale and boost its domestic presence with this transaction. The discussions are at an advanced stage and agreements between both parties are likely to be signed within the next few weeks.”Wockhardt, a third source said, wants to reduce its debt burden and is seeking a valuation between Rs 2,400 crore and Rs 2,700 crore. But was quick to add that the final deal value may vary based on due diligence.NoneNoneWockhardt had a total debt of Rs 3,367 crore as on March 31 and its current market capitalisation stands at around Rs 2,820 crore. It has a diversified product portfolio with a presence in therapeutic segments such as cardiology, dermatology, diabetes, respiratory and ophthalmology.Moneycontrol could not independently verify which of the firm's segments have been identified for divestment. Investment bank Moelis is advising Wockhardt on the sale process.""There are not too many overlaps in the therapeutic segments of Cipla and Wockhardt. Both are present in acute therapies, but have different areas of expertise,"" said a pharma analyst. Cipla claims leadership position in the respiratory and urology segments.Wockhardt reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 94.24 crore in Q2 FY20 compared to a net loss of Rs 30.84 crore in the same period last year. The de-growth was mainly on account of lower sales in quality generics division and in some of the therapeutic areas. India business contributed 28 percent of the global revenues in Q2.An August report by India Ratings highlighted, “the significantly elevated refinancing risks for Wockhardt in the Q2 FY20 due to its weak liquidity position for servicing its upcoming debt maturities over the same period."" Excerpts from the India Ratings' report:""In the absence of a meaningful recovery in operating performance, the company has witnessed continuous depletion in cash balances for servicing debt obligations. Furthermore, the agency expects a weak free cash flow generation in FY20.In FY19, the company’s promoters had infused Rs 250 crore in the form of redeemable preference shares to refinance Wockhardt’s outstanding preference debt. The management is evaluating refinancing options for the large upcoming debt repayments (2Q-4Q FY20: Rs 490 crore; FY21: Rs 841 crore) through term loans and other capital infusion options in India and abroad.Also, additional financial support from the promoters through the issuance of redeemable preference shares of Rs 250 crore as per a board resolution in December last year and proposed debt issuances may provide liquidity back-up till H2 FY20. NoneUnlike its peers, Cipla's depends substantially on its India business, with 38 percent of revenue accruing from the domestic market last fiscal.During the recent Q2 interaction with analysts, the Cipla management said, ""Overall, the India business including the generics and branded came strongly to deliver 29 percent growth on a QoQ basis. This was driven by performance across key therapies and strong seasonal triggers on the branded side and a strong recovery on the generic side, highlighting the resilience of the business after the distribution model change in Q1.""In August 2016, Umang Vohra was elevated to the corner office, replacing Subhanu Saxena as MD and CEO."

title,In Depth | Jharkhand Assembly Polls 2019: The Naxalite movement and how it affects elections in the state
datetime,2019-11-29 15:45:00+00:00
description,"Ahead of the five-phase assembly elections in Jharkhand, let's study the 'biggest' threat to internal security, which ravages the state and is the likely cause of the prolonged election schedule"
content,"Jharkhand, a small state carved out of Bihar in 2000, is headed for elections in five phases starting November 30 and ending December 20. The counting is scheduled to take place on December 23.The Model Code of Conduct has been in place since November, when the Election Commission announced the dates.Jharkhand has 81 Assembly seats and an estimated population of 33 million – about 30 percent of the number of seats and population of Maharashtra.  Yet, elections in Jharkhand are being conducted in five phases spanning nearly a month, as opposed to Maharashtra, where polls were held in one phase.When asked about the prolonged duration, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, citing the 2014 state assembly elections, said, “Earlier also, polls in Jharkhand have been conducted in five phases.”To further his argument, Arora said four out of every five assembly constituencies in Jharkhand were affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE). “19 out of the 24 districts of Jharkhand, with 67 Assembly seats, are affected by LWE. Of the 19 districts, the situation in 13 is worse. So special security arrangements have to be made by deploying adequate forces in the LWE-affected areas.” he said.However, the Election Commission’s assertion is in sharp contrast with the statements of incumbent Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das, who during a media interaction in 2017, had said Naxalism is on the verge of extinction in the state.“From the beginning of 2018, Jharkhand will be free from Naxalism as we have taken several steps to end Naxalite terror,” Das had said.Who are Naxals, what is their ideology, what are their demands and how do they attempt to influence (read: boycott) elections, let's find out:Who are Naxals?Staunch proponents of the philosophy of the late Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong, Maoists advocate a class war waged by peasants against what they claim is a bourgeoisie state.The nomenclature ‘Naxals’ for Indian Maoists was born from an incident that took place in Naxalbari village of West Bengal.On May 25, 1967, peasants, landless labourers and Adivasis with their lathis, arrows and bows raided granaries of a local landlord, who had attacked a tribal farmer, and forcefully wrested control of the land.The name of the obscure village has come to be identified with the movement ever since.How did the Naxalite movement gain momentum?NoneInspired by this, intellectuals, including students fresh out of universities, who were disillusioned by the system that had failed to meet their ideals starting preaching revolution to the poor.The movement was led by Charu Majumdar, and his close associates Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal, who tried following Mao Zedong’s tactics to capture political power.However, the Naxalite movement has eventually become radically different from what Maoism stood for.Where do Naxals operate?The Naxalite movement germinated and thrived in the poorest and the most backward rural areas, where Adivasis in the forests suffer at the hands of thetrader-contractor-moneylender nexus or the Dalit and OBC agricultural labourers and very poor peasants are cruelly oppressed and exploited by bigger landowners and rich farmers.In uniting the peasants against landlordism, Naxals have kept the agrarian demands of the rural poor alive in Indian politics.Maoist insistence on armed resistance to counter oppression has appealed to a large section of the impoverished population.Which are the main groups?There were several small outfits, operating in different parts of India. For instance, the People’s War Group (PWG) was established in 1976 and was active in Andhra Pradesh, while the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) held meetings in Bihar.The Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist-Janashakti was formed in 1992 and enjoyed a clout in Andhra, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.The contemporary Naxalite movement took shape in 2004, when PWG merged with the MCC to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist) or CPI (Maoist). The group is banned in India.The Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC) is a splinter group of the CPI (Maoist), which is based in Jharkhand.It is important to note here that the mainstream communist parties do not support the Naxal rebellion. In fact, since these parties contest elections at various levels, the Naxals consider them a part of the state, they are fighting against.What do they want?Struggles in Jharkhand forests seek to combine class demands with that of self-identity, dignity and autonomy for the marginalised minority nationalities.NoneMore often than not, their struggles transform take the shape of militancy, which is loosely based on the military strategy of Mao Zedong. People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) is the armed wing of the CPI (Maoist).MoS Home Kiren Rijiju had told the Parliament in 2017, ""As per available reports, the estimated armed cadre strength of the left-wing extremist groups is around 8,500. However, their support base is in larger numbers.”How many states?As per an article published in The Hindu on April 15, 2006, the Centre was worried that “the Naxal menace now extends to a dozen states” and “has spread to nearly 40 percent of the country’s geographical area, with the affected population going up to 35 percent.”However, the areas where Naxals exert control, a belt euphemistically called the ‘Red Corridor’, are spread across the states of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. Maharashtra and West Bengal are moderately affected by the Naxal conflict.What led to the growth of the Naxalite movement?NoneThe central and eastern regions of India are very rich in mineral resources and are home to a dominant tribal population, which is primarily dependent on land for their livelihood. They are mostly subsistence farmers and live in abject poverty. Hence, they perceive mining activities as posing a direct threat to their land and livelihood. And therefore, mining belts and conflict zones exist symbiotically making villagers prone to Naxalism.How many lost their lives in the Naxal conflict?In 2009, former Prime Minister had called the Naxal rebellion the biggest “internal security threat” and had launched a counter-insurgency operation, which is often dubbed as ‘Operation Green Hunt’.The operation elicited a louder response from the Naxals, who attacked any representative of the State – politicians, police and forest contractors. At a more local level, they target village political functionaries and landlords, often extracting protection money from them.Naxals have also been accused of perpetuating a vicious cycle by blocking development in order to continue to retain control over the very lives of the tribals and villagers they claim to represent.NoneHave there been any incidents of late?NoneIn Latehar, rebels of CPI(Maoist) in Latehar ambushed a patrol van to kill an ASI-ranked official and three Home Guard jawans. The next day, rebels shot dead a BJP supporter and a fruit-seller in Palamau and torched earthmovers in Lohardaga.Experts suggest that rebels attack at strategic moments (ahead of polls) for maximum impact. In line with their agenda of waging a class war against the state, they call for boycotting elections. It has been observed that violence before the polls affects voter morale and hence the turnout.Rebel violence statistically is on the wane. In 2019, till September-end, Jharkhand police recorded 238 cases of Naxalite violence across the state. In 2018, the number was 358.This could be attributed to Jharkhand’s surrender policy, which encourages rebels to lay down arms and join mainstream politics. The programme promises cash, land and livelihood to those who surrender.Over 100 rebels, including top ranking ones such as Kundan Pahan, Nakul Yadav have reportedly surrendered under the policy, weakening the base of rebels.NoneBut police say there are still 196 top and mid-ranking rebels who have not yet surrendered. Names such as Prashant Bose, Misir Besra and Asim Mandal, active in Jharkhand, carry a reward of Rs 1 crore on their heads.NoneNoneHuman Rights Violations? The Adivasis are often caught in the crossfire between the Naxals and the security personnel. The security forces have been accused of committing mass sexual and rights abuses as well as extrajudicial killings. Villagers, who are often recruited by the Naxals for their operation, become vulnerable to arrest and torture by government forces.Naxals too have been accused of killing and torturing villagers after accusing them of being police informers.Besides, there is a murky side to surrenders too. In 2016, JMM leader Hemant Soren claimed that the surrender of the nine PLFI (People’s Liberation Front of India – a splinter group of CPI (Maoist)) members was to shore up numbers and window-dress the state government’s policy as all nine of them were actually villagers without a criminal past. Soren even demanded a CBI inquiry into the surrender.What has the government done to contain the Naxal conflict?Various initiatives have been taken by the government to curb the Naxalite movement. These include special development programmes supported by local administrations to reduce the Naxals’ hold over the rural poor.Besides, since law and order is a state subject, each state has resorted to their own strategy to curtail violence in conflict areas. Plus, the Centre has set up a special 10,000-strong Combat Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) to fight them.However, the debate that the long-drawn-out insurgency is nearing its end is still fresh. While the Naxals keep making their strength felt by daring attacks on state functionaries, it would be untenable to say that they continue to be the formidable threat to India's internal security, as they were in the late 2000's.Many experts are of the view that left-wing extremism in India is in terminal decline. Not only has the ideology of revolution lost its old appeal, an improved performance from the state on the development and governance fronts has posed a challenge to their growth."

title,Financial reinsurance: Another capital-raising route for life insurers?
datetime,2019-11-28 18:02:00+00:00
description,One proposal has been sent to the regulator while four others are under consideration.
content,"Financial reinsurance may become a new mechanism for insurance companies to raise capital. A survey by independent consulting firm Milliman showed that 35 percent of life insurers are looking to enter financial reinsurance arrangements.The insurance regulator is open to allowing life insurers to enter into such arrangements with reinsurance companies.Under the arrangement, a reinsurer will provide capital in the form of reinsurance commission to an insurance company and as the insurer writes business, it will repay this as reinsurance payouts to the reinsurer.Sources said one proposal has been sent to the regulator while four others are under consideration. This process is to enable life insurers to tap other forms of raising capital.""This will be only used selectively because approvals will be tough to get. Global reinsurers may also set tough payment conditions and demand a higher premium for providing capital. Largely, mid-size and small insurers may explore this,"" said the chief financial officer of a private life insurer.All such capital raising is subject to approval to regulatory approvals. Detailed guidelines may also be brought out to this effect.Milliman said in a report that financial reinsurance enabled with approvals to be granted by IRDAI could be on a case-by-case basis.“While no deals have been announced as yet, we are already seeing active interest from insurers in this area,” said the report.Globally, financial reinsurance is a popular mechanism to raise capital for insurance companies. Here, the reinsurer takes the risk on its book and gets paid reinsurance premium. However, there is also a sunset clause in these agreements that would force a write-off in 10-15 years, if the capital is not repaid.For instance, if a reinsurer (R) enters into an agreement with an insurer (I) for 15 years, then the idea is that I will have to repay R within those 15 years. If I does not make any profits during the entire 15 years, R will be required to write it off after that period. This means that R makes a loss on the provided capital.The capital has to be given upfront and it is likely that Indian insurers would rely on foreign reinsurers for this requirement. Considering the type of risk that is involved, only global reinsurers would have the appetite to agree to be part of such deals.The profitability clause is typically for one set business which is in need of capital. For instance, if a life insurer wants to write more non-participating business (products where you don’t get bonuses), the financial reinsurance agreement will specifically mention this fact. Only if the non-par business makes a profit do they need to pay reinsurance premium.However, since this is a new capital raising instrument in India, the initial uptake could be low. The Milliman survey showed that respondents said they preferred shareholder capital injection over other instruments like subordinated debt and financial reinsurance. A total of 17 of 24 life insurers participated in the survey."

title,4 insurance policies that doctors must take
datetime,2019-11-28 15:22:00+00:00
description,"The four policies – professional indemnity, personal accident, property and public liability – put together would cost a doctor less than Rs 25,000 annually"
content,"Abhishek BondiaMy grandfather once told me that it was not money that added to a doctor’s wealth, but the good wishes from patients. Medicine, in his view, was to be seen as a noble profession not to be equated with a commercial enterprise. Fast forward twenty-five years, and the situation for doctors is more complex. Medical practitioners have to worry not just about patients’ health, but also about several external risks typically associated with commercial units. Patients, especially in the Metros, are now less deferential and demand more accountability. From my conversations with doctors, I realise that there are a few risks that weigh on their minds.Fighting legal casesLitigation from patients is one such major risk. Medical outcomes for individual cases are difficult to control and predict. Unfavourable outcomes are emotionally draining for patients and their families. Often, they attribute the negative outcome to the doctor’s negligence. Increasingly, patients litigate and demand compensation. Courts often decide in favour of patients. The Supreme Court, in a high compensation case, asked three doctors and the hospital to pay over Rs 11 Crore to a patient, who lost his wife while undergoing treatment.The court observed, “Before parting with the judgement, we are inclined to mention that the number of medical negligence cases against doctors, hospitals and nursing homes in the consumer forum are increasing day by day…the right to health of a citizen is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.”Irrespective of whether doctors win or lose cases, they have to hire lawyers to defend themselves in these suits. This can be time-consuming and expensive. A professional indemnity insurance protects doctors from patients’ claims related to omissions, negligence or errors. The insurance covers defence costs during the investigation, and expenses related to representation and compensation, if any, awarded by the court.In fact, a good insurer will also have a panel of lawyers that can defend the doctor. The coverage costs about Rs 5000 for a Rs 50 lakhs sum assured for a general surgeon. The premiums vary by the risk inherent to the doctors’ speciality.Protection from physical assaultsOff-late, incidents of doctors being physically assaulted have also become frequent. In one medical association magazine, an advertisement offered bouncer services to protect doctors. A survey done by the Indian Medical Association indicates that 75 per cent of the doctors have been at the receiving end of verbal abuse, of which 12 per cent have been physically abused. In June, about 8 lakh doctors across India went on a strike after a junior doctor was brutally assaulted in West Bengal, by the relatives of a deceased patient. More recently, a post-graduate doctor in Bengaluru was attacked by a mob. Of course, such situations have to be prevented. So, doctors must insure themselves against accidental injuries and disabilities. An individual personal accident insurance cover of Rs 1 crore would cost around Rs 14,000 . If an association comes together to buy personal accident for its members, the cost would be a fraction of the above due to economies of scale.Then there is a fire hazard, which could happen with any establishment. Clinics and hospitals, however, suffer more. In case of an accident, patients may not be evacuated quickly. The fire incident in Kolkata’s AMRI hospital is still a daunting image. The incident saw 90 persons lose their lives. The hospital had to deal with several litigation cases. To cover such risks, doctors need to buy a fire insurance policy to cover damages to the assets owned by them, and a public liability insurance to cover injuries and property damage to others, while at their premises. Fire insurance of Rs 25 lakh costs Rs 2500 and public liability insurance of Rs 50 lakh costs Rs 6000. Several clinics have expensive equipment and these can be insured for burglary as well, in the same property insurance.The four policies – professional indemnity, personal accident, property and public liability – put together would cost a doctor less than Rs 25,000 annually. Several medical associations realize the importance of such insurance policies to make their members’ practice more secure. Professionally run hospitals already invest in these products.My grandfather’s dream did get fulfilled, when my brother became a doctor. My brother tells me that it is not easy to run a medical practice these days. The middle class demands a high level of care and attention. Because the number of doctors are so few – India has about one-fourth the doctors per capita as compared to what the US has – the average face-time that a patient gets with the doctor is low. While patients complain about high cost of OPD (out-patient department) consultations, the average doctor earns substantially lower than her school friend working in an MNC. Doctors try to make it up by working long hours.  This leads to a pressure cooker-like situation for the practitioner. She ends up being at the receiving end of the patients’ wrath rather than receiving good wishes. Doctors must proactively address these risks to develop a sustainable practice. Insurance is just one part of this."

description,You can carry out a paperless know your customer (KYC) process using the Aadhaar eKYC service
content,"There is good news for Aadhaar card holders. Recently, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) launched a new version of the mAadhaar mobile app. This has been launched with two major sections, which include dashboard services and my Aadhaar section. On these new sections, you will get a single window for all Aadhaar online services and a personalised space to save your Aadhaar profile as well as to manage it through the app.No automatic updationIt’s important to know that the older version of the app will not get updated automatically in case you have installed it on your smartphone. On Aadhaar’s official twitter handle, there is a suggestion for users to download the new version of the mobile application and uninstall the old mAadhaar application which was being used until now.The new mAadhaar app is compatible with both android and Apple mobiles. It can be downloaded from the Google play store or Apple app store. This app can be downloaded only on mobile numbers registered with UIDAI.The new features of the mobile application are explained later. It is important to understand the objective of the mAadhaar app.In July 2017, UIDAI had launched the mAadhaar mobile app for smartphone users. On the mAadhaar app, registered users can carry demographic information such as name, date of birth, gender and address, along with a photograph as linked with their Aadhaar number. These details are useful while confirming your identity while availing government services, for verification purposes at banks, or even as an identity while travelling in trains etc. With the Aadhaar details being available in the official app of UIDAI, you don’t need to carry a physical copy of the Aadhaar card.New features of mAadhaar appDigiLocker, a digital storage service operated by the government also allows you to store the Aadhaar card and other official documents on the cloud and is accepted as valid identity proof in trains and airports. But, there are additional unique features in the mAadhaar that make it a better application to install and use.Using the new mAadhaar mobile application, you can download the soft copy of your Aadhaar card and order a reprint of the physical card. You can also request for any updation of your address in case of an error or if you shift residence. You can even lock or unlock biometrics and lock your authentication using the Aadhaar number. However, you can generate a virtual ID, which will allow you to authenticate transactions, without having to give your Aadhaar number.You can carry out a paperless know your customer (KYC) process using the Aadhaar eKYC service. Also, in case you lose or misplace your Aadhaar unique identification number (UID) or enrolment ID (EID), you may able to retrieve it with this mobile application.The app also provides the facility to generate time-based one-time password (TOTP), which is valid only for 30 seconds. This feature is useful in case the one-time password (OTP) to authenticate the Aadhaar number is not sent to the registered mobile number due to some technical issues. To prevent any data leak, users are given the option to generate a QR code on this app with Aadhaar details and share it with the concerned organisation for verification purpose."

Smaller towns are becoming more conducive to single brand retail and there is more demand for branded clothing in these places. We recently opened in smaller towns like Junagadh, Firozpur, Chandepur, Belgaum, Hyderabad and few more (stores) in Delhi. We have seen an encouraging response in smaller towns. We opened a flagship in Panchkula as well as in Muhali.,” he said.The brand has close to 1,600 total point of sales across metros, tier II and tier III cities.The company has also forayed into footwear market as it sees an increase in demand for casual lifestyle shoes. “There is a lot of demand for athleisure or for sports inspired fashionable shoes. Consumption pattern for footwear has changed. Back in the day people had one or two pair of shoes. But now men have seven to 10 pairs of shoes,” he said."

description,"There were several prominent brands in the food and beverage sector making comparative claims regarding the product composition, taste preferences, health benefits or market leadership."
content,"Advertising sector watchdog ASCI upheld complaints against 344 misleading advertisements, including those of Dabur India, ITC, Parle, Amul, Nestle, Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), for August and September.ASCI investigated complaints against 564 advertisements of which 179 advertisements were promptly withdrawn by the advertisers on receipt of communication from ASCI.The independent Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) of ASCI evaluated 385 advertisements, of which complaints against 344 advertisements were upheld. Of these 344 advertisements, 259 belonged to the education sector, 50 belonged to the healthcare sector,  eight to personal care,  eight to the food & beverages sector, and 19 were from the ‘others’ category.There were several prominent brands in the food and beverage sector making comparative claims regarding the product composition, taste preferences, health benefits or market leadership.According to the ASCI report, many of the claims were not adequately substantiated. The CCC also considered the comparisons to be unfairly denigrating the entire category in which the advertiser brands were competing in.NoneGujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) Amul Butter Cookies presented their butter cookies to be superior due to presence of 25 percent butter and zero percent vegetable oil.However, they made a sweeping statement that “other” butter cookies contain only 0.3 percent to 3 percent butter and 20 percent to 22 percent vegetable oil without presenting any verifiable evidence.ASCI pulled up Nestle India Ltd for advertisement of Maggi Nutrilicious New Masala Oats and Maggi Nutrilicious New Masala Veg Atta. The advertisement did not clearly indicate whether the noodles are ""Fried"" or ""Non-Fried"".This was considered to be a violation of FSSAI Regulation, 2011 which states that “instant noodle product shall be presented as ‘Fried Noodles or Non-Fried Noodles’. The information needs to be “presented” as required by the FSSAI within the advertisement - regardless of where it appears (i.e. on pack, digital advertisement, YouTube advertisement).NoneThough offer claiming ""33 percent extra"" on 60g pack was not considered objectionable, its presentation on pack was misleading by omission as it does not mention the basis of comparison alongside the offer claim, in font size equal to or more than 25 percent of the font size of ""33 percent extra"" claim.NoneThe product provides only a moderate degree of repellency (4 -40 percent, which is less than half). On the claim of the safety of the product, the CCC observed that the advertiser did not provide any test report of safety for the product when in proximity to human skin.NoneThe test data provided, was not adequate to conclusively prove that a forearm lab test on a small number of panel members can be extrapolated to a “real life” bathing, towel drying and post bathing situation to adequately substantiate “capsule deposition all over the body and (fragrance capsules) bursting on touch over a period of 8 hours on dry skin”."

title,"Tax litigation, the saga continues with GST"

description," GST, as it is being perceived by the industry, is falling short of success on a core parameter for judging tax reforms i.e. reduced litigation."
content,"Jitendra Motwani & Rinkey Jassuja""Litigation,"" said Ambrose Bierce, ""is a machine which you go into as a pig and come out of as a sausage.""A look at this year’s economic survey will give us a sense of how many pigs are being turned into sausages in India. According to the recent economic survey, close to Rs 9.46 lakh crore is held up in tax litigation.Given the increasing indirect tax woes being faced by industry, the Government of India introduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017. For businesses to flourish, it is imperative for the tax environment to be conducive. A fear that haunts business entities doing business in/with India is the rampant litigation and the amount of time taken for litigation to conclude.One of the key objectives to be achieved with the introduction of GST was to reduce litigation. GST as it is being perceived by industry, is falling short of success on a core parameter for judging tax reforms i.e. reduced litigation.Looking back, over two years have passed since the introduction of GST. The given objective seems far from being achieved considering the large amount of writ petitions and advance ruling applications that are being filed every day.A number of disputes have already arisen in relation to credit transitioned by the taxpayers into GST,  let alone the credit availed under GST. An overview of some burning issues in the GST regime, which affects businesses across India, will reveal the criticality of GST disputes that haunts business entities today.Apart from the litigation, which is more in nature of issues being faced during transitioning from old indirect tax regime into the new one, the issues that challenge the jurisdiction of actions taken by the Revenue department are going ahead in full steam.The issuesThe transition of education cess, Secondary/Higher Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess (KKC) into GST has been one such controversial issue. Clarifications were issued by the the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs vide FAQs that the said credit would not be allowed to be transitioned under GST.On challenge, however, the Madras High Court allowed the writ petition and held that the transition of the said credit under GST was valid under law. It is yet to be seen how the other High Courts of the country interpret the provisions with regards to this issue. This lack of consistency between the courts and the administration has flummoxed industry.Another debatable issue is the proposal to set up a national bench of the GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) in the capital city. The composition of GSTAT has come under criticism as there is a single judicial member with two technical members (each from Centre and State) which is certainly likely to result in an apparent imbalance in rendering justice and could undermine the impartiality of the Tribunal.The Madras High Court, on challenge, held that the number of expert members could not exceed the number of judicial members on the bench. The other High Courts are yet to pass a judgment on the said issue. While the number of appeals currently filed before the first appellate authority is insignificant,  the decision to constitute GST Tribunal will have a significant impact on the dispute redressal system.Power to arrestWhile the issues mentioned above affect businesses across India, another critical aspect of GST is the power to arrest for the violation of GST laws.Under GST, the officers have been granted the power to arrest a person in case he has a reason to believe that the person has committed certain offences including supply of goods or services without issuance of an invoice, collecting tax without passing it onto the government and issuing an invoice/bill without the supply of goods or services and, thus, wrongly availing/utilizing input tax credit.If the amount of tax evaded or input tax credit wrongly availed exceeds Rs 5 crore or Rs 2 crore, the person is liable to be imprisoned (along with the payment of fine) for five years or three years respectively.The heinous offences of collecting but not paying the tax and issuance of fake invoices coupled with the availment of credit basis the same are covered under the scope of arrest. These offences are non-bailable and cognizable.Government officials have been robust and swift in their approach to nab such taxpayers dealing in fake invoices or involved in huge tax evasions.The taxpayers took the route of challenging the action of arrest by filing writ petitions. Contrary views were expressed by the High Court of Telangana and Bombay on the said issue.On appeal, the Supreme Court directed the constitution of the larger bench to resolve the issue which is still pending. There are taxpayers who, on such impending arrests, approach the High Court seeking bail under the provisions of Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code/. Generally,  on consideration of Bail applications,  the taxpayers have been allowed bbail on a deposit of a huge sum with a condition for daily appearance before the police authorities.And, the saga continuesConsidering the size of the  Indian economy and the complex business models, disputes between the taxpayers and the tax authorities are inevitable. This saga of tax litigation seems to be continuing in the GST era, too. While there is a shift in the model of levy of indirect taxation in India, whether that shift can be aligned in the way the Revenue Department thinks while administering the law is the moot question. It would be interesting to see, given the controversial rulings from various High Courts, how the GST laws will shape up and if the government and how the judiciary will be able to address the challenges in a time-bound manner."

content,"Dev AshishUnlike other financial goals, Retirement Planning is a peculiar one. Unless you are lucky to have an inflation-protected pension from the government, you are really on your own. You need to save for your retirement, properly.And you have just one shot at it. If you get it wrong, then the realization of being wrong will generally occur so late that it would be difficult to get your retirement savings back on track. It’s like running a marathon, where if you decide to get serious only in the last few kilometers, you won’t win or be able to change the outcome of the race by running very fast very late.So you need to start early and invest in the right retirement savings products.Of course, the products suitable for saving before retirement may or may not be suitable for the post-retirement period, as money planning differs for the timeframes before and after retirement.Retirement productsThat said, let’s have a look at products suitable for retirement savings:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneDifferent people have different retirement planning needs. So it’s possible that for a few others, some other products might also work. For example: If one is investing a comparatively larger amount for retirement and EPF deductions are capped ( and VPF unavailable) and PPF limit is exhausted, then debt funds and tax-free bonds can also be considered.When saving for retirement, it’s important to have proper asset allocation and diversify across products (but not diversify too much). And unless you know the exact amount you need to save for retirement and other goals, you will never be sure whether you are on track of retirement or not."

In a bid to exhaust the inventory and make way for fresh stock, dealers will begin rolling out discounts from December 2019.While ACs may carry a discount of up to 30 percent, other appliances like TV sets, washing machines and refrigerators may come in cheaper by 10-15 percent.""There has been inventory pile up. Unseasonal rains in the beginning of summer proved to be a dampener for AC sales in 2019. We are trying to make way for new products for 2020 and hence brands have agreed to offer discounts,"" said the head of a pan-India consumer electronics retailer.Diwali sales were also lower than expected and hence the decision to extend the discounts. While the sale during the festival  were marginally higher than 2018, but the 40 percent revenue jump anticipated by appliance firms could not be achieved.To help mitigate this situation, the quantum of discounts are expected to be higher in the offline channel than online.During the festive season, appliance retailers had complained about e-commerce players indulging in anti-competitive practices and offering discounts which were not sustainable.""Flash deals have affected offline retail business. Hence, we have to make up by cutting prices of appliances in stores,"" said head of sales at a mid-sized white goods firm.E-commerce firms had offered mouth-watering deals for TVs during the festive season. Shinco's 55-inch television was offered for Rs 5,555 as part of an Amazon flash deal as against its original price of Rs 34,000. However, offline players are unable to offer these discounts due to store expenses as well as people costs.When it comes to ACs, the winter season extended till March end in parts of North India. Hence, the sales of products were hit. Further, inventory has been piling up since 2018, which was another bad year due to a cooler weather.""Considering that sale of ACs has taken a hit of at least 30-35 percent in 2019, discounts will be higher,"" said the head of consumer appliances at an electrical goods firm.The discount period that will begin in December will continue till the first week of January 2020.Free accessoriesAmong the other consumer durables, the sudden fall in TV panel prices led a crash in television prices. However, heavy rainfall and frequent cyclones in parts of the country hit sales by almost 20 percent.Hence as the year comes to a close, TV makers are also in talks with dealers to not just offer discounts by also free accessories.The head of televisions at a global white goods firm said that there is a tough competition among the companies to display their sales promotions prominently among electronic retailers.""Getting prominent store space will be crucial because this determines the quantum of sales. We have already lost out despite major sporting events like the cricket World Cup being held this year. Hence discounts and dealer incentives are being rolled out,"" the official added."

Out of savings, 10-15 percent of savings are into mutual funds compared to 50 percent globally in developed nations.“We are confident that the mutual fund pie of investments will increase at a higher rate than FDs in the savings portfolio of an investor. AUM for HDFC AMC has doubled in the last three years. The company’s market share is around 15 percent,” Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research - Narnolia Financial Advisors, told Moneycontrol.Agreeing with Sharma, an ex-SEBI officer who is an investor now said, “The AMC as a business has more upfront cost-such as set up costs and investor acquisition cost whereas, later on the running basis, the cost is less, only needed for fund operations. Thus, profits in later years are higher for AMCs, giving good valuation visibility.”"

description,"In a rangebound trade, experts advised focusing more on stock selection and trade management. Here is the list of 10 stocks which could return 14-24 percent in next 10-12 months:"
content,"After a 13 percent rally since September 20, the market has largely remained rangebound in the month of November as the tussle between bulls and bears to take control over Dalal Street intensified.The Sensex made an all-time high of 40,857.73, up 498 points intraday on November 25, while the Nifty50 was up 159 points at 12,073.5 at the time of publishing this copy.On the stock-specific front, the volatility has been high, which has kept traders on their toes. They now await the next set of measures from the government which will fuel the next leg of the rally.""We had a one-year target of 12,600 for Nifty50 which we are maintaining. We foresee some consolidation in the short-term due to the premium valuation in largecaps and weak macros. We are also more positive on mid & smallcaps compared to the largecaps given the reasonable valuation of 15x on one year forward P/E and improvement in the strength of balance sheet with better cashflow as per second-quarter result,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.In the last one month market's top 100 stocks have rallied 3 percent while midcaps have outperformed frontliners with a 5 percent return. Nair expects the midcaps to continue outperforming in the long -term as risk-taking ability & investment environment in equities has improved.In such rangebound trade, experts advised focusing more on stock selection and trade management. Here is the list of 10 stocks which could return 14-24 percent in next 10-12 months:Brokerage: Reliance SecuritiesNoneBlue Star is looking at newer products and recently entered into water purifier, air purifier and air cooler markets. It has reported a strong performance in Q2FY20 with its adjusted PAT growing 78 percent YoY to Rs 39.6 crore led by a healthy 21 percent YoY growth in revenue, higher other income and lower interest.With an 11 percent YoY growth in order inflow to Rs 790 crore during the quarter, the company's order book rose 33 percent YoY to Rs 2,940 crore as of Q2FY20-end.Brokerage: SMC GlobalNoneThe company will continue to drive sustained profitable volume-led growth over the medium term, through its focus on strengthening the franchise in the core categories and driving the new engines of growth towards gaining critical mass. Over the medium term, the company retains the target of 8-10 percent volume growth and healthy market share gains in the India business.Thus it is expected that the stock will see a price target of Rs 434 in 8-10 months time frame on an expected PE multiple of 45 times and FY21E EPS of Rs 9.65.NoneWith a strong quarter on revenue execution front, receding of client-specific issues, deal winning momentum and a better outlook for the banking segment gives a belief of improving trajectory ahead. The management of the company believes that high growth in digital will continue as customers leverage new/exponential technologies.The company has strong domain expertise derived from its parentage. Thus, we expect the stock to see a price target of Rs 1,985 in 8 to 10 month’s time frame on a one year expected P/E of 19.91x and FY21 (E) earnings of Rs 99.69.Brokerage: Axis SecuritiesNoneSundaram Finance's conservative approach to building a healthy vehicle finance book has resulted in a consistent performance. Subsidiaries profitability was mixed with muted Insurance/AMC business and slightly better HF business. The overall slowdown in the auto sector could be an overhang on the stock for the next couple of quarters. We have lowered AUM to around 12 percent CAGR over FY19-FY21E.Gross NPAs/net NPAs have also been tweaked marginally upwards. We believe stable asset quality and lower tax rate to support superior ROA over FY19-FY21E. We maintain buy on the stock with a SOTP target price of Rs 1,922.Brokerage: ICICI SecuritiesNoneThe domestic pharma industry is expected to grow in the range of 9-11 percent per annum. Issues such as NLEM and other regulatory aspects are mostly in the price. On the flip side, the looming threat of Jan Aushadhi and trade generics are some headwinds at this juncture.However, we continue to believe in Abbott’s strong growth track in power brands and the capability of new launches on a fairly consistent basis (100 products in the last 10 years).We expect revenues, EBITDA and PAT to grow at around 13 percent, 21 percent and 25 percent CAGR, respectively, in FY19-22E. We arrive at a target price of Rs 14,600 based on 35x FY22 EPS of Rs 417.Brokerage: Morgan StanleyNoneDLF is now our top pick in the industry. The company has a balanced portfolio of development and yielding assets. Power to monetise its land bank is on the rise, led by neighbourhood development. However, it remains predominantly leveraged to the NCR region. Our updated model shows reasonable valuation, and we see comfort in asset-based valuation.We have upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight earlier, with a new price target of Rs 269 (target discount to NAV of 25 percent, narrowed from 30 percent), implying 24 percent total return potential from current levels.Brokerage: JM FinancialNoneHDFC is a compelling buy opportunity given its superior liability franchise with the largest deposit base within the NBFC space. It is also best placed to benefit from lower rates and normalisation of credit spreads going ahead (130bps credit spreads on 3-year paper versus 90bps two years ago) and is poised to maintain retail home loan market share while selectively increasing market share in the corporate segment.We expect AUM CAGR of 13 percent over FY19-21E with earnings CAGR of 17 percent. HDFC is our top pick in the HFC space and a compelling buy with a target price of Rs 2,700.Brokerage: BP EquitiesNoneIndusInd bank being an established player in the banking domain has been witnessing a steady operational performance led by healthy NII growth and other income growth. With the downside risk limited coupled with only 2 percent of loan book being exposed to stressed accounts (media, diversified and housing finance), a sense of comfort is derived. All these factors contribute to our positive view of the ban.On the valuation front, we recommend a buy rating on the bank assigning a P/BV multiple of 2.9x of FY21 book value implying a target price of Rs 1,703.Brokerage: LKP SecuritiesNoneWe foresee a big turnaround in the earnings on the back of lower credit cost of 1.5 percent in FY20e and 1 percent in longer-term, gradual margin improvement and pickup in the loan growth. We expect ROE to improve to 15 percent in FY22e from 3.9 percent in FY19. Unlike in the past during FY15-19 where PAT had degrown at a CAGR of 22 percent, we expect PAT to grow by 141 percent in FY20e, 63 percent in FY21e and 24 percent in FY22e i.e. at a CAGR of ~70 percent over FY19-22e.Comfortable CAR 13.2 percent and high PCR of >70 percent reduces any immediate risk of dilution. Subsidiaries are increasing in size and stature gaining market share given favourable demographics and their presence in important respective financial service space. Long-term value un-locking in subsidiaries could be immense. Balance-sheet of the bank has now strengthened remarkably over the years with a lower concentration of large borrowers, rise in granular retail loans and an increase in lending to better-rated corporates.With strong balance-sheet, the bank is now well-placed to participate in multi-year strong credit growth. We value the bank at Rs 598 with buy rating, assigning multiple of 2.6x FY21e ABV of the bank and valuing the subsidiaries at Rs138 post 15 percent holding company discount.Brokerage: Dolat CapitalNoneZee has historically traded at around 30x 1-yr forward P/E. However, with reduced promoter stake (lesser-skin-in-the-game), Balance sheet deterioration (C&CE declines to Rs 1,500 crore as of September 2019 from peak of Rs 4,000 crore in Mar-17 and Rs 3,100/2,300 crore as of Mar18/19), structural changes in the industry with Zee lagging behind in digital (ZEE5); historic pre-crisis multiple is not warranted. We thus value Zee at 20x Sep-21E EPS with revised TP of Rs 440 (from Rs 330 @ 15x).Zee’s improvement in cash generation and traction in digital business will the key ponderable from here-on. Improvement in either of the metrics may lead to the plausibility of further re-rating."

content,"The ‘encounter’ of the four accused in the gruesome rape and murder of a 27-year-old vet in Hyderabad in the wee hours on December 6 is the third such incident (not involving Maoists) in Telangana in the last 10 years.The accused, who were taken to Chattapally, about 30 kilometres from Hyderabad, post-midnight to recreate the crime scene, were shot dead by the police after they allegedly tried to escape after attacking the police.In a coincidence of sorts, Cyberabad police chief VC Sajjanar was at the helm of this encounter much like he was in Warangal, when three men charged with throwing acid on two girls were shot dead by the police.The other two incidents are:2008 Warangal ‘encounter’The case dates back to December 12, 2008, when the Warangal Police shot dead three persons accused of throwing acid on two engineering girl students. The encounter was led by VC Sajjanar, who was the then SP (Superintendent of Police) of Warangal, which was then a part of undivided Andhra Pradesh.At that time, the police had claimed that the accused were killed in self-defence as they had tried to escape after attacking the the police team, which had gone to recover a motorcycle used by them in connection with the case.The police action came in the wake of a public outcry over the acid attack in which the faces of the two girls were disfigured.

title,Messi clinches a record-breaking sixth Ballon d'Or

description,"Four years after his last Ballon d'Or, Messi pulled clear of the five next to the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, and now owns twice as many as Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten."
content,"Lionel Messi has won a record-breaking sixth Ballon d'Or on December 2  after another sublime year for the Argentinian and FC Barcelona captain.Messi whose familiar brilliance remained undimmed even through difficult times for club and country. Despite Barcelona's collapse at the end of last season and Argentina losing to Brazil in the semi-finals of the Copa America, Messi's genius was ever-present in 2019, for which he now stands alone in the history of the game's most prestigious individual prize.Four years after his last Ballon d'Or, Messi pulled clear of the five next to the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, and now owns twice as many as Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten.In 54 appearances this year, Messi has managed an astonishing 46 goals and 17 assists while for Barca alone he hit 41 goals and 15 assists in 44 matches, which included seven doubles and three hat-tricks.""It's like he is extra-terrestrial,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde in March. ""Every time he gets the ball something extraordinary seems to happen.""Messi's first season as club captain brought a third consecutive La Liga title and he scored the winner in the game that clinched it, a 1-0 victory over Levante.He also claimed his sixth Pichichi Trophy as the division's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 matches.But Barcelona unravelled as their 3-0 advantage over Liverpool -- to which Messi contributed a brace -- went up in smoke at Anfield and the club crashed out in the semi-finals of the Champions League.They were then beaten by Valencia in the final of the Copa del Rey, when Messi's tap-in proved a consolation, but it was his voice that spoke loudest in defence of coach Valverde, whose survival owed much to the support of his captain.Messi had led the way on the pitch too, particularly during the run-in when he scored 16 goals in 12 games as Barcelona put together a relentless winning streak.""This league has one person's name on it,"" wrote Diario Sport.- 50th career hat-trick -=========================He scored his 50th career hat-trick in a 4-2 win at Sevilla and in April, another hat-trick began with a free-kick into the top corner and ended with a sweeping chip from the edge of the area that was so good even the Real Betis fans felt compelled to applaud.When asked about their reaction, Messi said: ""To be honest I don't remember anything like that.""His goal was nominated in the FIFA Puskas Award's 10-long shortlist.""I have not seen any player like Messi in the history of football,"" said Betis coach Quique Setien.""His goal was something you do playing Playstation.""After finishing the Champions League as top scorer with 12 goals and collecting his sixth Golden Shoe for a record third consecutive year, Messi joined up with Argentina for the Copa America, a tournament that kickstarted a frustrating three months for the 32-year-old.Messi was sent off against Chile in the third-place play-off and his comments about the refereeing drew him a three-month suspension from international football.A return to Barcelona should have offered some respite but Messi suffered a calf injury on the first day of pre-season before a thigh strain meant he would not begin playing regularly again until October.Yet he made up for lost time by scoring six goals in five games and then a hat-trick against Celta Vigo, this time a treble made up of set-pieces, two from free-kicks and one a penalty.It was his 34th hat-trick in La Liga, equalling Ronaldo's record in the Spanish top flight.Free-kicks have become an increasingly potent weapon for Messi and his improvement is more evidence of a player still adding to his skill-set in what can be assumed will be his twilight years.""It's clear that when games are close we have the advantage of having the best player in the world and the best free-kick taker in the world,"" said Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets.Another milestone came at the end of November when his goal and two assists in a 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund coincided with his 700th appearance for Barcelona. On Sunday, he scored the winner in a 1-0 victory at Atletico Madrid.Barcelona insist they have plans for coping with Messi's dreaded retirement but the truth is their number 10 will be irreplaceable."

description,A quick look at the 10 bellwether seats in Jharkhand that have always voted for the party that eventually forms the government
content,"Jharkhand is polling to elect a fresh Legislative Assembly. Elections are being held for all of the state legislature’s 81 seats.NoneRaghubar Das, Jharkhand’s only chief minister to complete a tenure, is leading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s campaign to retain power.The saffron party is being challenged by an alliance comprising former chief minister Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the Indian National Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).BJP’s long-time ally, the All Jharkhand Student's Union (AJSU) is contesting this election separately. Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) is also contesting alone.While results of opinion surveys and exit polls are often the subject of debate, historic election data, at times, paints a clearer picture.To get a sneak peek into what the election result could turn out to be, political observers have been studying opinions and reactions of voters in the state’s bellwether seats.What is a bellwether seat?By definition, a constituency that votes for the political party which eventually forms the government is called a bellwether seat.While there is no scientific basis to this, bellwether constituencies usually act as a marker for the final results.It is to be noted that Raghubar Das is the only chief minister in Jharkhand’s history to have completed a tenure in office. This means that governments in the state have changed frequently even as the Assembly polls were held only every five years.NoneTwo or more governments have been sworn in within one Legislative Assembly tenure on more than one occasion.For example, three governments were in office during the third Legislative Assembly (2009-2014). First, it was JMM leader Shibu Soren’s government that lasted under six months. This was followed by President’s Rule and a BJP government led by Arjun Munda. This government lasted under two and a half years. Finally, after another segment of President’s Rule Soren’s son Hemant formed a government that lasted till the end of the Assembly’s tenure concluded.Hence, the analysis takes into consideration the first government formed after every Assembly election held in the state. It does not consider any government formed subsequently.The majority mark in Jharkhand’s 81-member Assembly is 41. No party has been able to reach that figure on its own. Having fallen short, parties have formed governments with the support of parties that were not part of their pre-poll alliance. These post-poll alliance has also been considered in this analysis.The winning side in 2014 was the BJP-All Jharkhand Student's Union pre-poll alliance. In 2009, JMM had formed the government with the support of BJP and AJSU. In 2005, JMM had formed the government with pre-poll partner Congress and post-poll support of RJD, Dumka’s Independent Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Stephen Marandi, among others.Here are Jharkhand’s 10 bellwether seats:Manika (Latehar)As Jharkhand has had only three Assembly polls after being carved out of Bihar, these 10 constituencies have always voted for a party that formed the government first.(Data source: Election Commission of India (EC) and news reports)"

We have suggested the MSC Bank to try to merge the PMC bank with it so that the poorest of its depositors get relief,"" Patil told reporters here.The PMC Bank has been put under restrictions by the RBI, after an alleged Rs 4,355 crore scam came to light following which the deposit withdrawal was initially capped at Rs 1,000, causing panic and distress among depositors.The withrawal limit has been raised in staggered manner to Rs 50,000.At least eight depositors, who had high quantum of money stuck with the bank, died in the last couple of months, including one who committed suicide.""We want to assure the PMC Bank depositors that the government stands with them. The merger of the two banks will definitely help small depositors,"" the minister said.Patil, who has earlier been finance minister of the state, said the MSC Bank's health is good and there should be no problem in case the PMC Bank is merged in it.The Maharashtra NCP chief also said that the process may take around one-and-a-half months to complete.The PMC Bank, which has around 16 lakh depositors, was placed under an RBI administrator on September 23 for six months due to massive under-reporting of dud loans.The bank, over a long period of time, had given more than Rs 6,700 crore in loans to the Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), which is 73 per cent of its total advances, and which turned sour with a shift in the fortunes of the now bankrupt company.Its total loans stand at around 9,000 crore and the deposits at over Rs 11,610 crore. There have been massive protests across city from the PMC Bank depositors following the RBI action.Twelve people, including top officials of the PMC Bank and HDIL, have so far been arrested by Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in connection with the scam."

title,Bharat Bond ETF first cut: The nitty-gritty of the government’s debt offering
datetime,2019-12-04 19:21:00+00:00
description,"The bond ETF, to be rolled out by Edelweiss AMC, will have two variants – one scheme maturing after three years (2023) and another after 10 years (2030)."
content,"India’s first bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) is just a few weeks away from being rolled out. Called the Bharat Bond ETF, Edelweiss Asset Management will launch it soon, after nearly two years of deliberation with the government of India. The former finance minister Arun Jaitley had made announcements relating to bond ETFs in his Budget speech of 2018. Now, here is a low-down on the structure of the product and some pointers for investors to benefit from.NoneThe structure of the debt ETFThe Bharat Bond ETF will have a definite maturity period, just like the way a closed-end mutual fund scheme has. Of course, the ETF units will be listed on the stock exchanges. In her first and exclusive chat with Moneycontrol, Radhika Gupta, the chief executive officer of Edelweiss AMC said that the bond ETF will have two variants – one scheme maturing after three years (2023) and another after 10 years (2030). Only the growth option would be available to investors. There would be no dividend option in these schemes.NoneBond ETFs such as these, which come with a defined maturity, are popularly known as ‘target maturity’ ETFs, abroad. And since these are schemes meant for specific tenures, Edelweiss will launch a tranche each in both these variants, once a year.Globally, bond ETFs are broadly of two types. One is an ‘all-term bond ETF’ that invests in bonds across maturities and resembles a typical open-ended dynamic bond fund. It is an open-ended fund and you can enter and exit at any time.None“Indian investors, who typically invest in fixed-income securities, need to know, even if indicatively, as to how much returns they can make,” says Radhika. The only catch here is that you must stay invested till maturity.In a way, the Bharat Bond ETF will loosely resemble a fixed maturity plan. Just like fund houses launch FMPs every year, Edelweiss Asset Management will roll out the two tranches of Bharat Bond ETFs every year. Meanwhile, the older tranches of Bharat Bond ETFs, the three-year and 10-year tranches, will continue to be available for those who wish to buy shorter duration schemes. The fund house would also ensure that the underlying companies continue to channelize their borrowing requirements – even for the reducing periods – through the Bharat Bond ETF. In simple words, the older tranches would also see re-issuances, even as new three-year and 10-year issuances come along. “This will ensure liquidity in older tranches also,” says Radhika.“But if those investors buy its units midway through its tenure, then they would need to re-calculate the yields of the underlying instruments, if they wish to analyse how much returns they could potentially get. That is what happens when you enter a closed-end type of an investment, midway,” says Joydeep Sen, founder, wiseinvestor.in.The ETF will be listed on the stock exchanges. Large investors will also be able to buy and sell units with the fund house directly. The first series will hold AAA-rated securities only. Later tranches could hold securities rated between AAA and AA+. There will be two baskets of securities on which the fund will be based upon. The three-year variant will have 13 companies, with REC, National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development and PFC as its top three components. The 10-year variant will have 12 companies with the National Highways Authority of India, Indian Railway Finance Corporation and REC as its top three constituents.What are the returns likely to be?Although the capital market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) does not allow mutual funds to guarantee returns, a scheme that comes with a defined maturity does give an indication. Bharat Bond ETF will invest in securities that are rated AA+ and higher, though Radhika says that bonds rated below ‘AAA’ aren’t that liquid. It will also invest in state-owned companies.The  three-year Liquid India AAA PSU yield has been typically 30 to 140 basis points higher than the three-year government securities yield, over the past about five years, according to Bloomberg data. The 10-year Liquid India AAA PSU yield, according to Bloomberg data, has typically been 50 to 140 basis points higher than the 10-year government securities yield, over the same period. The yield of the three-year index has moved in the range of 6.8-8.9 per cent and that for the 10-year index moved between 7.1 per cent and 8.9 per cent. This could roughly be the pattern of the Bharat Bond ETF, depending on the interest rate cycle in which each tranche gets launched and also the underlying securities.Trading volumes The question is: would investors be able to buy and sell effectively? Would there be enough liquidity in the market for the Bharat Bond ETF’s units? Radhika says that the fund house has appointed market makers to ensure that there are sufficient number of units available for those who wish to buy them, as well as for buying from those who wish to sell units.Then again, all ETFs have market makers, but most ETFs have insufficient liquidity. The lack of a sizeable number of units at an appropriate price leads to an impact cost.For instance, if you wish to sell 1,000 units at the prevailing market price, you may not find a buyer who would want to buy this entire lot. In such cases, you may be able to sell a few units at that price. For the remaining units thereafter, the price keeps fluctuating, depending on the order book on the stock exchange. Would Edelweiss AMC, then, incentivise the market makers, especially given the fact that the income it will make from the Bharat Bond ETF will almost be negligible? Radhika did not comment but said that the fund house “in whichever way possible, will ensure liquidity.”Also, only those investors who wish to buy or sell units worth Rs 25 crore would be able to directly approach the fund house. For everyone else, there are market makers. This higher threshold for approaching the fund house, she adds, would also ensure the market makers have enough units circulating.How will the debt ETF work?A government ETF, such as the Central Public Sector Enterprises’ ETF and Bharat ETF, helps investors buy shares in multiple state-owned companies. Instead of selling its stakes in several companies at different points of time, the government offloads all of the divested stocks and sells it to an ETF. The ETF raises money from the public and pays back the government. Units of this ETF are then available in the market for investors to buy.A debt ETF – much like a debt fund – does not give investors the ownership of companies, unlike an equity vehicle. Instead, it provides a chance to state-owned companies for borrowing funds from a large section of investors. Think of several companies issuing non-convertible debentures instead of equity shares, almost at the same time, to the ETF. The ETF collects the amount and lends it to the companies that require the funds for a fixed period of time. The companies pay back the ETF, which in turn gives the amount back to the investors.Globally, debt ETFs are common. As per data from etfgi.com, a UK-based database and research firm that tracks ETFs worldwide, the number of debt ETFs grew from 995 in 2016 to 1,559 by the end of September 2019. During the same period, the assets of debt ETFs grew from $659 billion to $1,185 billion. In fact, so far in 2019, debt ETFs have seen more net inflows (more money came in than went out) to the tune of $171.529 billion, as compared to equity ETFs that saw a net inflow of $134.899 billion.Shyam Sekhar, Chief Ideator and Founder, iThought, says that the quality of companies that are part of the ETF basket would determine the ETF’s success. He says that there are lessons to be learnt here from recent events. “The government has to unambiguously say what it would do, in case any of these underlying companies fail to pay up. It should clearly lay bare the risk factors. For instance, if a state-owned bank fails, people assume they will get their money and deposits back and the government will pay back. But that doesn’t always happen,” he says adding that a good-quality basket is very important for the fund.Joydeep says, “The USP (unique selling point) of the product is the concept. It imparts the benefit of FMPs (predictability of returns) and does away with the deficiency. Hopefully, market makers will ensure liquidity to the ETF units. It does away with the issue of fund manager performance (buy and hold strategy). It would be better to limit the investment universe to AAA-rated firms. What happened recently with two fund houses, when their FMPs matured but one issuer could not pay up, is a learning for us.”Do you need a demat account?Yes, you do. Since ETFs can only be brought on the stock exchanges, you need a demat account. However, to facilitate transactions for investors who do not have a demat account, Edelweiss AMC’s Radhika says that the fund house will launch a fund of funds (FOF) MF scheme. Such a scheme will collect money from investors the way normal funds do and will invest its entire proceeds in the ETF."

description,The December 6 jobs report provided a respite from all the pessimism and from the continuing uncertainty over the status of US-China trade negotiations
content,"The dollar gained on December 6 after five straight days of losses, lifted by data showing the US economy created more jobs than expected in November, backing the Federal Reserve's stance of keeping interest rates on hold after cutting them three times this year.Gains in the dollar were fairly modest despite the robust jobs number, however. The greenback has been pummelled all week due to a slew of weaker-than-expected data in the US manufacturing and services sectors, with investors coming to grips with the reality that the economy is slowing down.The December 6 jobs report provided a respite from all the pessimism and from the continuing uncertainty over the status of US-China trade negotiations.Data showed non-farm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, with manufacturing recouping all 43,000 positions lost in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180,000 jobs.The dollar still posted its worst weekly percentage loss in more than a month despite Friday's (December 6) gains.""No question today's jobs report is strong, but is it strong enough for people to change their views about the economy?"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.""I still think the US economy is weakening and I don't think today's number is going to change people's expectations for Q4 GDP (gross domestic product),"" he added.The New York Fed Staff Nowcast estimate for GDP in the fourth quarter stands at 0.6 percent and 0.7 percent in the first quarter next year, according to the NY Fed website. Poor US data releases earlier reduced the GDP estimate by 0.2 percentage point for Q4 and lowered the expectation for Q1 next year by 0.3 percentage point.Earlier in the week, US data showed dismal figures on private payrolls, services, manufacturing, and construction spending.The jobs report reinforces expectations that the Fed will remain on hold at next week's policy meeting, with its outlook on monetary policy seen little changed from the last statement.""We suspect the large majority of the (Federal Open Market) Committee will be comfortable projecting no change for policy rates in the year ahead,"" Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JP Morgan, wrote in a research note.In afternoon trading, the dollar index gained 0.3 percent to 97.707. For the week, the dollar was still down 0.6 percent, its largest weekly loss since early November.The dollar was up 0.1 percent against the Japanese yen at 108.59 yen, posting its worst weekly performance in nearly two months.The euro, on the other hand, fell to 1.1058, down 0.4 percent."

datetime,2020-05-10 12:11:00+00:00
description,"The sore-spot for the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena alliance is not in the new-found Sena-Congress ties, but the equations in the NCP and the Pawar family."
content,"The Common Minimum Programme (CMP) that supposedly lists out key priorities for the new government opened with a ‘preamble’ emphasising on ‘secularism’ rather than propounding a grand political vision for Maharashtra.Ironically, the Congress spent too much time hammering out the CMP until the early morning ‘shock and awe’ type of swearing-in of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister on November 23. This robbed the Opposition of its slumber and forced it to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court, whose intervention for an early floor test saved the alliance.Soon, strategy managers were busy in herding their numbers and wooing the rebel, NCP’s Ajith Pawar who was sworn-in as deputy chief minister under Fadnavis, back to the fold. The political drama ended on November 26, a day before the apex court-ordered floor test was to be conducted. This has left the ‘numbers versus longevity’ game to be settled for another day.For grabbing an opportunity of heading the government after 20 years, the Shiv Sena dumped a 30-year-old alliance with the BJP and shed initial disagreements on using the word ‘secular’ in CMP, where now the word appears twice in the first paragraph itself. Reports were that the Sena was against the word appearing in the coalition’s or Maha Vikas Aghadi’s CMP.A day after he won the confidence vote, Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra’s Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray could not help saying that the Hindutva ideology is indispensable to the Shiv Sena and the party will not leave it. “I am still with the ideology of 'Hindutva' and won't ever leave it,"" he said in the state assembly.They rely on his averments that he would not allow anything “that makes the common man feel terrorised.” Therefore, the CMP would serve as a tool that will “bridge the ideological and temperamental gulf between the Congress and the Sena by focusing on some pressing issues faced by the commoners, particularly farmers.”Other key focus areas in the CMP were hardly contentions issues as most parties agreed on tackling them on a priority basis: farm distress, unemployment, health, industry, social justice, women, education and urban development. Similarly, a law to ensure 80 per cent reservation in jobs for local/domicile youth (which is seen as the Sena’s plank) should not bother the ruling partners in terms of their ideologies.However, observers feel that the sore-spot for the alliance is not in the new-found Shiv Sena-Congress relationship — it is the equations within NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s family where his prodigy Ajit Pawar has returned to the NCP fold and where tension is brewing. It is said that the junior Pawar has still not reconciled to Thackeray being allowed a full five-year term as CM.On the other side, the Congress is wary of Ajit Pawar after he joined hands with the BJP. That said, Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi and her aides realise that he is too important for the NCP and cannot be stopped from becoming deputy chief minister. Without him in the government, the NCP may well disintegrate.Importantly, the Congress’ decision to nominate a former BJP MP Nana Patole for the assembly Speaker’s post is not exactly an expression of friendship towards the NCP. Patole, a fourth-term MLA from Sakoli, won Bhandara Lok Sabha seat as a BJP candidate, defeating former Union minister Praful Patel in 2014. Patole quit the BJP and joined the Congress following his disappointment with the top BJP leaders, citing their friendship with Patel and for refusing to act against his acts of commission and omission during the UPA regime. Patel remains a very influential leader in the NCP as he is close of the Pawars. Patel has never been averse to the NCP doing business with the BJP and won’t take kindly to the Congress’ decision on Patole.Be as it may, the Thackeray-led Cabinet will be expanded this week. The buzz is that, besides the post of deputy CM, the NCP is all set to emerge as the biggest gainer by getting high-profile portfolios such as revenue, home and the public works department. It is also likely that the NCP may get one more ministry than the Shiv Sena. Given these complexities, the BJP’s wait may be longer than it thinks, but are there enough reasons for the Aghadi to come unstuck a year from now?"

content,"A mutual fund is a way to pool in money for investment in a variety of underlying securities. A mutual fund house issues unit of mutual funds to investors in proportion to their investment money. The objectives of the mutual fund are disclosed in the offer document. The profits or losses are shared by investors in proportion to their investments. A mutual fund must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) before it can collect funds from the public.A mutual fund is a popular investment option as it provides access to a large portfolio of assets. Some of the mutual funds also provide higher returns than the ones from conventional investments. A mutual fund is professionally managed by a fund manager who takes all the decisions in line with the financial goals of the investor.There are various types of mutual funds on the basis of the maturity period and investment objectives. Let’s take a look at the various types of mutual fundsOn the basis of the type of underlying asset in which investment is made, the following are the various types of mutual funds:NoneNoneNoneOn the basis of structure, there are three types of mutual funds in India:NoneNoneNoneFollowing are the types of mutual funds in India based on the investment strategy:NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneAs is the case with most investments, mutual funds are subject to various risk factors. On the basis of the level of risk involved in the investment, the following are the types of mutual funds in India:High-risk FundsMost equity schemes are high-risk funds. These work best for investors with a huge risk appetite who want huge returns. These funds need active fund management. They are subject to market volatility. You can expect 15% returns, though most high-risk funds generally provide 20% returns and 30% in some other cases.Medium-risk FundsMost debt funds fall into this category. The risk factor is medium as the majority of the investment is in debt and the rest in equity funds. The NAV is not that volatile. The and the average returns are between 9-12%. These work best for investors who do not have a very high-risk appetite and want steady returns.Low-Risk FundsIf the investor is unsure about the investment decision or there is a sudden crisis in the market, it is recommended to invest the money in either one or a combination of liquid, ultra-short-term or arbitrage funds. The returns offered are low, but the risk associated with these funds is also very low.Very Low-Risk FundsExamples of this category of funds are liquid funds and ultra-short-term funds. These investments are not risky at all. However, the returns from this scheme are very low. These work best when the investor needs to fulfil a short-term financial goal and wants a low-risk option.Here are the special types of mutual funds in India:Gilt FundsThese funds invest exclusively in government securities. There is no risk of default from these investments. However, the NAVs of these schemes are susceptible to change in interest rates and other economic factors.Index FundsThese funds replicate the portfolio of a particular index such as the BSE Sensitive index (Sensex), NSE 50 index (Nifty), etc. These schemes invest in securities in the same weightage comprising an index. The increase or decrease in the NAV is in accordance with the rise or fall in the index. However, it does not mirror the index exactly by the same percentage due to some factors known as “tracking error”.Fund of FundsA scheme that invests primarily in other schemes of the same mutual fund or other mutual funds is known as a FoF scheme. An FoF scheme enables investors to achieve greater diversification through one scheme. It spreads risks across a greater universe.Foreign FundsForeign Mutual Funds are favored by investors seeking to distribute their investment to other nations.

It spreads risks across a greater universe.Foreign FundsForeign Mutual Funds are favored by investors seeking to distribute their investment to other nations. This can deliver excellent yields to investors even when Indian stock markets don't perform well. An investor can use a hybrid strategy (say, 60% in national equities and the remainder in overseas funds) or a feeder strategy (receiving local funds to position them in foreign stocks) or a theme allocation (such as Gold Mining).Global FundsGlobal funds are quite distinct from International Funds. While a global fund invests primarily in markets around the world, it invests in securities in India. On the other hand, international funds focus exclusively on foreign markets. Global funds can be diverse and universal in strategy due to the distinct policy, market and currency differences across the world. It works as a break against inflation. The long-term returns from these funds have been historically high.Real Estate FundsDespite the real estate boom in India, owing to numerous hazards, many are cautious of investing in such projects. Real estate funds can be an ideal option for such investors. In these funds, the investor is only an indirect participant who places the money in established property firms/trusts instead of real estate projects. These funds demand a long-term investment. These funds also negate hazards and legal difficulties associated with buying a property to use it as an investment vehicle.Commodity-focused Stock FundsThis is one of the types of mutual funds which is a great option for investors with adequate risk appetite who are seeking to diversify their portfolio. Commodity-Focused funds provide an opportunity for the investor to dabble in various sectors of industry. However, the returns are not regular and are either based on stock company performance or commodity performance itself. Gold is the only commodity where mutual funds can directly invest.FoF is one of the types of mutual funds that refers to a scheme that invests primarily in other schemes of the same mutual fund or other mutual funds. Such schemes enable investors to achieve greater diversification through one scheme. The risk profile is reduced as the investments are made across different funds.It is possible to change the nature of the scheme. However, SEBI has laid down certain regulations which need to be complied with for affecting such a change:Any changes in the fundamental attributes of the scheme such as the structure, investment pattern, etc., can be changed only when written communication is sent to each unitholder and an advertisement is given in one English daily newspaper having nationwide circulation. The information should also be published in a newspaper published in the language of the region where the head office of the mutual fund is situated. In case the unitholders do not want to continue with the scheme, they have the option of exiting the present scheme at prevailing NAV without bearing exit load.As per SEBI regulations, every mutual fund has the obligation to disclose full portfolios of all of their schemes on a monthly basis on their website. Portfolio disclosure on a half-yearly basis is published in the newspapers. The fund house can also send the disclosure of half-yearly portfolios to their unitholders.There is no size fits all approach to investment decisions. The investor should take into account the specific needs and the investment objectives before deciding. Information about various types of mutual funds is available online and in the offer document. It is advisable to read them carefully. "

title,"Dividend mutual funds: Advantages, types, how it works"

description,"Dividend Funds: Everything you need to know about Dividend Mutual Funds, its types, advantages, how it works & how to invest in India. Read more on dividend mutual funds at Moneycontrol."
content,"As an investor, based on investment goals, you can choose to invest in two kinds of mutual fund systems: growth-oriented and dividend-oriented. A growth-oriented mutual fund invests in a potential-showing company's stocks. The main goal of the investment is to achieve maximum capital appreciation.On the other hand, you can choose to invest in a dividend yield fund. The fund house invests in stocks of businesses paying a large dividend in this situation. These firms produce high earnings that enable dividends to be declared. Investments are therefore made in stocks of businesses that have proven track records of earnings being declared. If you've invested in dividend-oriented funds, you might want to learn about these dividend mutual funds.Dividend mutual funds can be categorized into two classifications based on asset distribution: Dividend Yielding Mutual Funds (Equity) and Dividend Yielding Mutual Funds (Debt) fund.In the case of a dividend mutual fund (equity), the fund house invests predominantly in equity stocks of a company. As per the regulations of SEBI, an equity mutual fund scheme must invest at least 65% of the scheme’s assets in equities and equity-related instruments. The chief objective of these funds is to provide capital appreciation over a medium to the long term investment horizon.In the case of a dividend mutual fund (debt), a mutual fund scheme invests in fixed income instruments, such as bonds issued by the government and corporate, debt securities, and money market instruments, etc.  These mutual funds are a popular investment option for investors who do not have a huge risk appetite but want steady returns. Debt mutual funds are referred to as fixed-income securities as the investor is aware of the returns to be received from the investment right from the time of the investment. These funds are considered less risky than equity funds and offer significant tax benefits.The above types of dividend mutual funds also vary from each other in terms of yields and tax treatment.Most investors who invest in dividend mutual funds generally seek a source of revenue. Dividends provide a constant and safe payment to an investor from their investment in mutual funds. Dividend mutual funds are best suited for retired investors due to their income-generating nature. Dividend mutual funds tend to be less risky than other kinds of funds, such as equity mutual funds.A stream of high dividends indicates that the company is performing very well. Dividends are tax-free at the hands of the investor. Dividends represent the distribution of profits among the shareholders and are treated as the income of the shareholders. The tax on the dividends is called the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT). Usually, the income tax is paid by the receiver of the income. However, DDT is paid by the company which is declaring the dividend. Therefore, dividend remains tax-free at the hands of the dividend holder.Since dividends are linked to profits of the company, an investor should only those dividend mutual funds which invest in profit-making companies. It is important to check the historical data of the dividend declaration of such companies before making an investment. A very high dividend declaration can indicate that the company does not have enough opportunity to expand.These funds do not perform well in bullish markets. There is also a tax implication associated with dividend mutual funds. it actually destroys your money because of the tax on dividends. The dividend income which is in excess to Rs. 10 lakh in a year is chargeable at the hands of individuals, HUF, partnership firms or private trust. The present rate is 10%. If you sell your investment, you also attract a long-term capital gains tax on the dividend at the hand of the investor. The tax deductions reduce the amount of dividend or the returns you can earn from a dividend mutual fund.In a dividend mutual fund, the fund house invests in stocks of companies that pay a high dividend. These companies generate high profits which allow them to declare dividends. Therefore, investments are made in stocks of companies that have a proven track record of declaring profits.If you choose a dividend yield fund, the returns that you receive are the dividends declared by the underlying company.  If the investor chooses this option, dividends are usually sent directly by the fund manager to the investor.  The fund house is required to dispatch to the unitholders the dividend warrants within 30 days of the declaration of the dividend. In case of failure to dispatch the dividends within the stipulated time period, the fund house is liable to pay interest as specified by SEBI from time to time for the period of delay. The delayed interest is 15% at present.You can also choose the dividend-reinvestment mutual fund. This mutual fund gives an investor the choice of reinvesting the dividends received. The dividend can be used by the fund manager to buy more shares. Reinvesting the dividend increases the number of shares owned and results in higher returns as compared to the dividend-yield option.Investors can invest directly or contact mutual fund agents for the necessary application forms that are needed. Investors must ensure that they invest through the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) registered distributors and that the distributor has a valid AMFI Registration Number (ARN).Investors can also invest in dividend mutual funds directly without a distributor. For investments through the direct plan, the investor needs a financial adviser but does not have to pay any commissions to the distributors. This maximizes the returns as there is no commission paid.Investors also have the option to invest directly with the mutual fund either by visiting the mutual fund branch or online through mutual fund website. Forms can be deposited with mutual funds through the agents and distributors who provide such services.Before making an investment, the investor should take into account the track record of the dividend mutual fund/scheme. As per SEBI regulations, all the mutual funds are required to label their schemes on the following parameters:a)  Nature of scheme – whether the aim is to create wealth or provide regular income in an indicative time horizon (short/ medium/ long term)b)  A brief about the investment objective (in a single line sentence) followed by kind of product in which investor is investing (equity/debt)An investor should take into account the product labeling before investing in a dividend mutual fund.The performance of a particular scheme of a mutual fund is indicated by the Net Asset Value (NAV).NAV represents the market value of the securities held by the scheme. Since the market value of securities changes every day, NAV of the same scheme varies on a day to day basis. The NAV per unit is the market value of securities of a scheme divided by the total number of units of the scheme on any particular date. For instance, if the market value of securities of a mutual fund scheme is INR 200 lakh and the mutual fund has issued 10 lakh units of INR 10 each to the investors, then the NAV per unit of the fund is INR 20 (i.e.200 lakh/10 lakh). NAV is required to be disclosed by the mutual funds on a daily basis.Yes, cash investments up to INR 50,000 per investor, per mutual fund, per financial year can be made in mutual funds. However, any repayment of the dividend is made only through the bank channel.Yes, non-resident Indians can also invest in dividend mutual funds. The offer documents contain the necessary details for the same.An investor should take into account his risk appetite, age factor, financial position, etc. There is no one size fits all investment strategy which applies to all the investors. Each investor should make a decision based on the investment objective and financial needs. The investor should also pay special attention to the offer document which contains all the details about the mutual fund.There may be changes from time to time in a mutual fund. The mutual funds are required to inform any material changes to their unitholders. Many mutual funds send quarterly newsletters to their investors. At present, the Scheme Information Document (SID) is required to be revised and updated at least once a year. In the meanwhile, new investors are informed about the material changes by way of addendum to the offer document till the time offer document is revised and reprinted."

title,Withdrawing money from mutual funds: SWP works better than the dividend option

description,"The way an SIP lets you invest in a fund as per your cash flow, an SWP lets you withdraw as per your cash flow requirements."
content,"There are two routes to withdrawing amounts from your mutual fund investments for your cash flow requirements, which are distinct from exiting the schemes. The two modes available are the dividend option and SWP (systematic withdrawal plan). The other way of withdrawal is in the form of a lump-sum, as and when required, which is ad-hoc. Let’s first understand the concepts of dividend and SWP.Taking out moneyDividends are distributed from the surplus accumulated in the dividend option of a fund, from time to time. The quantum and timing of the pay-out are at the discretion of the fund manager. There are certain defined dividend options – monthly, quarterly etc. – and AMCs do pay out in that frequency on a best-effort basis, though there is no obligation to do so. In other words, if a fund pays a dividend after one year in the quarterly dividend option, it would not be violating any rule. The reason: dividend distribution is subject to availability of a 'distributable' surplus in the fund, which in turn is a function of the underlying market. To overcome this issue, sometimes, fund managers keep some ‘reserve’ in the NAV – i.e., they pay-out an amount that is less than the available surplus – to provide for future dividend pay-outs during adverse market conditions. If you try to gauge the future dividend pay-out of a particular fund from the pay-out history, it would at best be indicative.An SWP is a method of withdrawing a defined amount, at a defined frequency, so that the money comes to you from your investment. If the amount withdrawn periodically is on the lower side, within the earnings accruing to the fund, it is fine. If the quantum or frequency of withdrawal is on the higher side, it will draw from your principal. However, you need not fret over withdrawing from the principal, because it is your money, meant to be used by you. An SWP is the best mode of withdrawal for retired people, as the desired quantum of money flows from the investment kitty. The other advantage of an SWP is tax efficiency. The holding period for eligibility for long-term capital gains taxation is one year for equity funds and three years for debt funds. For tax efficiency, provided your horizon permits, invest in growth option and start the SWP after one year of holding for equity funds and three years for debt funds. Tax is computed on a FIFO (first in first out) basis; hence you will get the benefits.Choosing the better mode of withdrawalNow let’s come to the issue we raised; i.e., which withdrawal route is better for you. The answer is the SWP, due to the following reasons:Limitations of taking the dividend route:- The quantum of dividend may be on the lower side; less than your requirements- The frequency may be uncertain; history is only indicative- The pay-out decision rests with the fund manager, not you-  The dividend option is less tax efficient than the growth option, for debt funds- Mutual Fund is a route for long-term wealth accumulation, not high pay-outsAdvantages of taking the SWP route:- You can customize the amount, frequency and duration as per your requirements- You can start an SWP anytime, to suit your requirement- You can increase/decrease the amount or even stop the SWP when needed- Generate tax efficiency in debt funds by starting the SWP after holding for three yearsAnother relevant aspect in this discussion is positioning of certain funds, particularly balanced schemes, on the basis of regular dividend pay-outs. What we need to understand here is that mutual funds are not Post Office Monthly Income Schemes (MIS). A mutual fund is a vehicle for long-term wealth accumulation from the underlying market, with your preferred allocation between equity and debt. For a section of investors, for e.g., retired persons who may require regular cash flows, SWP is the better mode of withdrawal. Otherwise, the pitch of “1 per cent dividend per month plus market upside” creates an illusion for the not-so-savvy investor of higher returns. If the market is favourable, you will get even better returns in the growth option; the dividends are not anything over-and-above what is due to you.To conclude, mutual funds invest money, on your behalf, in the underlying market, i.e., equity or debt. Returns from the market will anyway accrue to you. Dividends paid to you are not an ‘extra’ or ‘bonus’ and are to be seen accordingly. The way a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) lets you invest in a fund as per your cash flow, an SWP lets you withdraw as per your cash flow requirements."

title,Explained | From payments banks to neo banks -- how India's fintech ecosystem has evolved
datetime,2019-12-04 19:51:00+00:00
description,"From digital wallets to payment gateways to the so-called “neo-banks”, the choices available to today's tech-savvy users are many."
content,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) granted in-principle approvals to 11 entities for setting up payments banks (PBs) in August 2015 and 10 for Small Finance Bank (SFB) in September 2015.The RBI grants two kinds of banking licences- Universal Bank Licences (the ones given to regular banks) and Differentiated Bank Licences (for niche banks). These niche banks cater to the needs of a certain demographic segment of the population. SFBs and PBs are examples of such niche banks.However, new financial companies, which tend to target the more ‘tech-savvy’ audience, are also gaining ground. From digital wallets to payment gateways to the so-called “neo-banks”, the choices available are many.Most of these digital payment facilities do not function like regular banks and hence do not require banking licences. There are certain overlaps in the services that are provided by these niche banks and payment facilities. Then what is it that makes them different?PAYMENTS BANKSA payments bank is like any other regular bank, but operating on a smaller scale and without involving any credit risk. It can carry out most banking operations but can’t advance loans or issue credit cards. It can, however, accept demand deposits (up to Rs 1 lakh), offer remittance services, mobile payments/transactions and other banking services like ATM and debit cards, net banking and third-party fund transfers (more like deposit-taking companies).The main objective of payments bank is to extend payment and financial services to small business, low-income households, migrant workforce, but in a secured, technology-powered environment.Aditya Birla Payments Bank, Airtel Payments Bank, India Post Payments Bank, Fino Payments Bank, Jio Payments Bank, Paytm Payments Bank and NSDL Payments Bank are some PBs that are functional in India.However, there are several restrictions imposed on the deposit portfolio of PBs. They can accept deposits of up to Rs 1 lakh only. In addition to this, they also have to maintain Cash Reserve Ratio on their deposits with the RBI and also have to invest a minimum of 75 percent of their “demand deposit balances” in government securities. As if this wasn’t enough, an additional 25 percent of their deposits must be held with other scheduled commercial banks for operational purposes and liquidity management.Hence, some of these payments banks are also considering a conversion to small finance banks.SMALL FINANCE BANKSA small finance bank undertakes basic banking activities like accepting deposits and lending to unserved and underserved sections of the population. The key difference between SFBs and regular banks is scale. SFBs mainly provide services to small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, with their USP being high technology coupled with low-cost operations.However, in a financial year, SFBs are required to open at least 25 percent of their branches in unbanked rural areas, similar to scheduled commercial banks.The central bank mandates small finance banks to lend 75 percent of their credit to priority sector borrowers. Priority sector includes those working in agriculture and small enterprises as well as people with low-income. This limit is higher as compared to that prescribe by the RBI for commercial banks, which have to lend only 40 percent of their credit to such sectors.Additionally, 50 percent of their loan portfolio must be made up of advances of up to Rs 25 lakh. These banks are also allowed to distribute simple financial products such as mutual funds, insurance and pension products.PAYMENT GATEWAYSPayment gateways are like bridges- they connect a user's bank account to platforms to which money transfers are to be made. It allows one to make online transactions by means of various payment modes like net banking, credit or debit cards, UPI and digital wallets like Paytm, PhonePe or Google Pay. It plays the third-party role in facilitating money transfer from the user's bank account to the platform.DIGITAL WALLETS Digital wallets, on the other hand, are basically secure storage systems for user information used for various payment methods and platforms. These mostly work through apps on users’ smartphones.NEO BANKS"

Out these, 4,000 will be set up at bus stops and 7,000 will be located in markets, residential welfare associations and other places in the city.On the launch of the scheme, 100 hotspots will be inaugurated. They will be set up at Kashmere Gate Metro station and ISBT, ITO bus stand, Mandi House bus stand, Delhi Secretariat, Indraprastha Metro station and Adarsh Nagar (18), Badali (19), Moti Nagar (10), Seemapuri (16) and Shahdara (18) Assembly constituencies.According to Kejriwal, there will be 100 hotspots in every Assembly segment. After the inauguration of the first batch of 100 hotspots on December 16, 500 hotspots will be set up every week and in the next six months, all 11,000 hotspots will be in place, he said.NoneNoneUnder the free Wi-Fi scheme, each individual will be allowed usage of 15 GB per month or 1.5 GB per day. The speed will be on average 100 mbps to 150 mbps with maximum of 200 mbps in some areas, the chief minister said.Each hotspot will be available for simultaneous usage by 150-200 persons. The entire network will handle around 22 lakh users at a time, he said.How to use the free Wi-FiIn order to enable people to use the data, the Delhi government will launch an app. Users can upload their KYC details. An OTP will be sent to activate the connection, Kejriwal informed.As each hotspot will provide internet services within a 100-metre radius, there will be an arrangement for automatic switch-over from one hotspot to another.Cost to the state exchequerThe total cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs 100 crore, said the chief minister. The Wi-Fi scheme is based on a rent model and the government will pay a monthly rental for each hotspot to the company handling the project, added Kejriwal."

content,"FASTags will soon be made mandatory on national highways across the country. This real-time payment project is a joint effort between the National Payments Corporation of India’s (NCPI), National Highway Authority of India and Indian Highways Management Company Limited.The authorities have announced that the electronic payment initiative is active across 560 tolls in India and will be extended to more tolls in the coming months.FASTag uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to collect toll payments as the vehicle passes through the plaza, not requiring it to stop. A scanner at the plaza reads the tag fixed on the vehicle’s windscreen, debiting the amount directly from the user’s account linked to FASTag. Over 20 banks and fintechs currently support the FASTag, which has a validity of five years. Users get an alert on their mobile when the credit balance is low and can recharge it online.Paytm Payments Bank is one fintech selling FASTags under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) program and has witnessed significant uptake for the product since November. It is free for passenger vehicles with INR 100 waived off as tag issuance cost. Customers have to pay INR 250 as security deposit and maintain INR 150 as minimum balance. Each FASTag is linked to a registered Paytm Payments Bank wallet or account, and this facility is currently functional at over 110 toll plazas in the country. The company plans to expand this to another 100 toll plazas by 2020.Even Amazon has seen rapid sales for FASTags since it started offering it on its platform. “After the government announced December 1 as the initial deadline for FASTag compliance, demand has since grown by 2.5 times over the preceding month,” the company stated. This urgency could be attributed to the announcement that those not using a FASTag will be charged double the toll."

Angavu was deeply shaken.Angavu's doctor advised her to go to India for surgery under the Kenyan government’s National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). The NHIF covers up to a maximum of 5,00,000 Kenyan Shillings (or Rs 3.5 lakh) for individuals seeking treatment abroad.A patient is referred abroad for treatment by the Kenyan government if there is evidence that the hospitals in Kenya lack the infrastructure for treatment of the disease and treatment cost is comparatively affordable.Once the referral is approved, Magnus Medi, the Mumbai-based medical value travel company takes over. Magnus Medi's office in Nairobi assists the patient in choosing the hospital, arranging visas, tickets and accommodation. It also facilitates medical appointments and supports patients during surgery, while also providing timely follow-ups.Angavu underwent surgery in Apollo Hospitals in Navi Mumbai and was discharged.

title,Explained: Why you should keep the AC at 24°C
datetime,2019-12-10 11:02:00+00:00
description,"From an electricity bill savings point of view, changing the temperature setting to 24 degrees from the current 18 degrees will reduce the power bills by around Rs 4,000. "
content,"A move by the power ministry to increase the default temperature in air conditioners to 24 degree celsius will help you save almost Rs 4,000 on annual electricity bills, apart from reducing energy consumption.The Ministry of Power (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) has said that all room air conditioners (AC) will have to ensure a default temperature setting of temperature in the appliances at 24 degree celsius from January 1, 2020.This will mean that a new AC will have 24 degrees as the pre-set temperature when the appliance is switched on. Individuals desiring a lower temperature can reduce it manually.While the power ministry has taken a decision to have a set temperature, there is a deeper reason behind this move.Why is the temperature set at 24°C?The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (a body of the Ministry of Power) has said that the reduction in AC temperatures to 24 degrees from the conventional 18-21 degrees can result in 24 percent of energy savings.Countries like Japan and the US have already put in regulations for the functioning of air conditioners. Japan introduced a default setting for air conditioners at 28 degrees celsius. In the United States, some places have enforced limits on lowering the air condition beyond 26 degrees celsius.How much energy can be conserved?The overall potential for energy conservation through such measures is estimated to the tune of 20 billion units (worth Rs 10,000 crore) annually. If about half (50 percent) the consumers adopt to such recommendations, this would result in about 10 billion units of electricity, which is equivalent to the reduction of 8.2 Million tonne of carbon dioxide per year.From an electricity bill savings point of view, changing the temperature setting to 24 degrees from the current 18 degrees will reduce the power bills by around Rs 4,000 annually. Increasing the temperature further to 27 degrees will reduce the yearly bill by almost Rs 6,500 compared to 18 degrees.Would it be feasible to have the AC temperature at 24 degrees in a humid weather?The Normal human body temperature is 36-37 degree celsius. Hence, to take a temperature closer to 24 degrees is considered to be healthier for individuals in tropical regions like India. The ministry says that, as per the comfort chart, temperatures up to 25 degrees are quite comfortable for human body, along with the desired humidity and air movement values.According to ASHRAE Standard 55-2013 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, The thermal comfort zone is the condition of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. This condition is defined using temperature, humidity level and air flow experienced by the human body, apart from individual parameters such as clothing and metabolism. Technical analysis indicates that, in order to achieve the desired comfort level at a steady state, the temperature setting can be 24-25 degree celsius.Wouldn’t it take more time to cool a room?This is a common misconception. The thermostat in the AC just checks the temperature of the air inside the room and stops the compressor when the temperature reaches the desired level.This means that the compressor will work longer if the temperature is set to a lower level. So, it will work more and use more electricity if the temperature is set to 18 degree celsius than if it is set to 24-degree celsius. This is because it will take less time for air to reach 24-degree celsius than 18 degree celsius as the compressor is working with the same power or wattage.Why is India taking this step?The Bureau of Energy Efficiency estimates that, considering the current market trend, the total connected load in India due to air conditioning will be about 200 GW by 2030. This may further increase as only 6 percent of households are using one or more air conditioners at present.If the measures are followed by all consumers, India can save about 23 billion units of electricity. The total installed capacity of air conditioner is about 80 million TR (tons of refrigeration or amount of cooling required to convert 1000 Kg of water into one tonne of ice in 24 hours), which will increase to about 250 million TR in 2030."

datetime,2019-12-09 14:09:00+00:00
description,"The hike comes because of a change in the star-rating table. With the change, the refrigerators will become more efficient and will consume lesser power"
content,"The prices of refrigerators are all set to rise from January 1, 2020. But, it may be a small price to pay for lower electricity bills.The price rise is because of a new table of star ratings being implemented by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) from 2020. The ratings, which are visible on a sticker on the fridge, undergo a change every two years.With each jump in a rating, the price will go up between Rs 300-500. In other words, a two-star fridge that may cost Rs 12,000 till December 31, will be pricier by Rs 500 from the New Year.“Customers have a chance to buy a higher star-rated refrigerator till December end since the table will undergo a change in January,” said Kamal Nandi, Business Head and Executive Vice President, Godrej Appliances.Over and above this, a five-star refrigerator may cost at least Rs 5,000 more because a new vacuum panel will have to be put in the appliance. Tweaks in the production line have to be done for this.What is the star rating?The BEE Star Rating scheme was launched by the power ministry in May 2006 and is currently applicable to appliances like room air conditioner, ceiling fan, colour television, computer, direct cool refrigerator, frost-free refrigerator and washing machines, among others .The star rating is a measure of energy efficiency of an appliance, it is a five-point scale where the higher the rating, the lower is the energy consumption and, hence, better savings.For each product, BEE decides a period of two to three years for which a rating table is valid. This rating table gives an indication of what is the energy consumption under each rating.Each appliance has the BEE Star Label mentioned on the cover. This gives an indication of how many stars the appliance has and how much is the expected units of power consumption.How will the refrigerator star labels change?BEE is of the view that, with technology advancements, the same appliance can be made more energy efficient over time. Hence, a review is done every two years.The review means that a four-star fridge, will now have only three stars from January 1, 2020. A five-star rated refrigerator will become four-star rated, and the current one-star rated refrigerators won’t be valid.This rating will be valid from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Since it is reviewed every two years, the new rating will come next in January 2022.BEE has told appliance-makers that the current one-star rated refrigerators will not be eligible for upgrade in the minimum energy performance level.When there is a rating change, appliance makers have to change the star rating on the device. One-star rated refrigerators will have to go out of production, and a new set of tables are followed to design the products.The star rating on the refrigerators does not just depend on the energy used but also on the size. BEE uses a formula based on the storage, volumes and energy use to come up with the star category changes."

But we said that we need to get into a lot more into the rural areas and thus we came up with this unique concept called the Studio Store. It was so successful in a few areas that by August we added 250 of them and by October, we launched another 250. We have now 500 of them, fantastic response for these,"" said Vinod Dasari, CEO, Royal Enfield.The average size of these stores are around 500-600 sq ft, which will be set up at an investment of Rs 5-6 lakh per store. In comparison, a regular Royal Enfield showroom is spread over a area of 2,000-4,000 sq ft that comes at a cost of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 3 crore, depending on the location.Since a major chunk of studio stores are coming up in the rural pockets the investment required is thus a lot lower compared to those that come up in the cities. There is a difference in pay-back period too which is faster in studio stores.""They were set up with the idea that, depending on location to location, they would do anywhere between 8 to 10 motorcycles a month. And it is not about sales only, it is about service too. So it is a full, smaller size, but a full Royal Enfield store. It is a proper dealership in that sense. So, all put together, from a motorcycle sales perspective, they were to do 8 to 10. The start has been extremely promising,"" said Lalit Malik, CFO, Eicher Motors.Domestic sales of Royal Enfield bikes fell 19 percent to 4.53 lakh during the April-November period as against 5.59 lakh sold in the same period last year. Royal Enfield claims to have a huge fan following in the rural areas given its long standing association with the armed forces and the huge number of people joining the forces from the rural areas.""They are pretty much 20-40 kilometers, depending on location to location, away from the main dealership. The break-even, generally speaking, is about 8 bikes a month, and that is only on bike only because service income will start in some period of time.

content,"NoneIn the clip, Mann, who is also the chief of AAP’s Punjab unit, is seen delivering a speech in the Lok Sabha.While talking about the Bill which proposes to regularise illegal colonies in Delhi, Mann points out that the AAP government in Delhi had passed a similar bill, but that has not received the nod as yet.He is also seen throwing digs at BJP members for making adverse remarks against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and taunts them saying the BJP has only three MLAs in the national capital, while the Congress has none.NoneNoneReacting to the video, BJP national secretary Tarun Chugh said it was unfortunate that Mann was treating the “hallowed precincts of the Lok Sabha” as a place for doing comedy.Chugh told the newspaper, “He [Mann] is conveying a wrong impression about Punjabis not only in the country but also internationally that all they do is just laugh and joke about.”“A previous MP who used to sit next to him in the last Lok Sabha had also complained against him that he is under the influence of liquor and had requested that his seat be changed as he reeks of liquor. We demand that a narco test be done on him,” he added.However, Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly and senior AAP leader, Harpal Singh Cheema, called the BJP’s demand laughable.Defending Mann, Cheema told the publication, “They [BJP] are unable to digest the pointed attacks made on them by Bhagwant Mann in Lok Sabha where he has thoroughly exposed him. He has a typical style of speaking and these people are unable to understand the satire that he uses to corner them.”"

title,Asit Baran Pati | An options buyer journey to financial freedom
datetime,2019-12-09 11:40:00+00:00
description,Option buying has got a bad name in the trading community mainly on account of the high rate of failure. Asit Baran Pati explains what it takes to make option buying hugely profitable. 
content,"""Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.""These words from Nelson Mandela are true for every successful person, be it a businessman, sportsperson, musician or a trader. It is especially true in the case of Asit Baran Pati @asitbaran, who rose like a phoenix from the ashes of his creation.From a well paying Investment Banking job to live off his mother’s pension money, Asit has seen it all. It was his confidence and persistence in search of a winning formula and sticking to it that made him a successful trader. The taste of freedom between jobs when he attempted to trade fulltime, was his driving force.A short term momentum trader and a scalper, he is among the few successful options buyer in the trading community. He has strong views on options trading and why retail investors need to be aware of the risks involved.Apart from trading, Asit likes to listen to western classical music. He confesses that he is an audiophile and collects different headphone and when he has some free time goes out looking for Vinyl records.In this interview with Moneycontrol, Asit Baran Pati talks of the ups and downs in his trading career and how he finally made it.Q) Can you tell us about your journey to becoming a trader?A: I have been on the research side of the Investment Banking field for the most part of my professional life. After completing my BCom Hons from Odisha I moved to Delhi to do my MBA in Finance after which I worked in various research firms conducting sector research.I later moved to Hyderabad where I worked for a KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) firm called Office Tiger where I worked for international clients like Blackstone and JP Morgan. After two years I moved to a company called UBS Captive which was being set up in Hyderabad. I worked there for nearly seven years and was actively involved in the Investment Banking research process preparing financial and valuation modelling. This was a high-pressure job where we used to work for 12-14 hours every day.Though we were compensated well for the sacrifices we made in our social life, the job was taking a toll on me. I remember a time when on a Diwali day we were asked to work the entire night because the analyst had a presentation the next day in the US. I along with my team, sat down to complete the job. It's for days like these when you question yourself as to what is important in life. For me the answer was simple – freedom to live my life the way I want. That move towards freedom was about to start.2012 was a watershed year in my life for more than one reason. I lost my father to cancer after an arduous 8-9 months of battle. We were also blessed with a pair of twins during the year. And finally, it was also the year I started dabbling in the market.My father who was a bank manager was a regular investor in the market, but till the time he was alive, I rarely looked at it. I guess he passed on the baton to me.During the initial period, I dabbled in the cash and futures market. Though my work experience was on the fundamental side I was never a patient investor. I preferred the shorter version. My interest in the market started growing as I steadily started making money.Looking back at it, it was plain and simple beginner's luck. There was no strategy that I was following. I picked up a stock that was moving or heard some recommendation on TV and traded them.Just before the 2014 election, I had bought some shares and few call options in the market. The sharp rise post-election results increased my investment by almost three times in a matter of one month. This event got me interested in the market.By now I was trading big quantities in the derivative markets and making good progress. I was making a month’s salary in a matter of a week in the market. There was a phase when every alternate day my profits were equivalent to my month’s salary. This period made me feel invincible and I used to think that I was good at my job and also good at trading.I was so carried away that I was trading with intra-day leverage of 10-15 times. Greed took the better of me. If I was making Rs 1 lakh in a day I would chase a target of Rs 1.5 lakh but end up losing the entire profit.Looking back I had no clue how I was making money. As is always the case, the law of averages caught up with me and my losing phase started. I lost my capital and savings in the market. To make matters worse, I left my well-paying job at UBS Captive to concentrate on my trading and recover my money.But my losses just would not stop. I kept on losing money regularly. The more losses I made the more aggressive I became. Revenge trading only made matter worse for me. My ego did not allow me to think rationally. I was good at my professional career and I felt that I would be good in the markets too. Accepting the fact that I had failed did not come easy.I tried everything in the market to recover my money, including paying for those pesky market calls from Indore. Nothing worked but there was a lesson in all this. It taught me what does not work. So I decided to find what does work.I was forced into reading books and blogs to prepare myself for the second innings and take trading as a serious business. The book that changed my life and my psychology to trading was Alexander Elder’s Trading For A Living. The Disciplined Trader by Mark Douglas and Trading in the Zone by Ari Kiev were the other books that had a big influence on me.But getting back on my feet would take some time. I was flat broke, I had borrowed money from family and friends and had no source of making money. There was no job nor any money left in the bank account and I had the monthly EMI to take care of apart from other expenses.The only thing I had was the support of my family. Though they did not know the intensity of my problem, I knew that I could count on them.I was always confident that I had enough skill and experience to get myself another job. I started looking for one and found it in Bank of America in Gurgaon in June 2015. Such was my state of helplessness that I did not have money to go to Delhi and had to ask my mother to give it to me from her pension fund.Looking back, had I not been completely broke with my self-esteem completely down, I do not think I would have done the kind of research and back-breaking work that I put in.I borrowed money from my mother to book a train ticket to Delhi from her pension account. I lived off my mother’s account for 2-3 months. For the first few months in Delhi, I stayed at my friend's place as I could not afford a rented house. Over the next few months, I could save enough from the new job to take care of myself and my family. But these few months of 2015 were the defining moment in my life.With some stability on the operational front, I was back looking for opportunities in the market. The job pressure in BankAm was lower than in UBS. But I had tasted freedom and was longing for it again. The difference this time was I knew what I was doing and had my systems and strategy in place to make money.More importantly, I knew that trading is a game of psychology and discipline. Technical analysis and strategies are secondary. How you think is how you trade. If you need to succeed in trading you must first change how you think. After a couple of years at BankAm, I was back trading full-time.Q: What all do you trade and how?A: I am an option buyer which means that I am dependent on momentum and trend to make money. In options, I generally trade the weekly Nifty and Bank Nifty options. I also trade stock futures.There are two main types of trading that I do. First is what one may call a BTST or a buy-today-sell-tomorrow trade which is based on momentum and the second is scalping. Signals for both these trades are generated by a system.Though I have a decent knowledge about charts I prefer to look at data like open interest built up, option chain, implied volatility, put-call ratio, etc. Apart from these, I have a series of indicators that help me navigate the market.Selecting an indicator is important. Many traders use multiple indicators which are overlapping and essentially confirm what the first indicator is saying. While no single indicator will tell the entire story, the goal is to integrate the information that indicators provide to get a better picture. I use indicators that are grouped under trend and momentum, breadth, volatility and volume category. The entire gamut of indicators helps reduce the clutter and present to me a multidimensional view of price behaviour.To get a comprehensive picture I use these indicators on multiple time frames ranging from 15-40-75 minutes to 1-3-6 hours. Different timeframes provide useful information on differing relative volatilities.The extract of these indicators and data are numbers which I rank. My system uses Bull and Bear ranking to each instrument. As there are 15 indicators that I use, during the phase of extreme bullishness the rank would be +15 and of extreme bearishness, it would be -15. So if Bank Nifty has a rank between +12 and +15, I would like to buy Calls and if it is between -12 and -15 I would like to buy Puts. The quantity that I will trade also depends on the ranking that the system throws up.In the recent past, there was one day when the system gave an extremely bullish signal of +15, that was also the day I made my biggest profit. This was the day the finance minister announced the corporate tax cut. There was also a time when the system could not prevent me from taking a sizeable loss. I had carried my long call position overnight and the next morning there was this news of air-strike. Being an outlier event, the system cannot be blamed for catching it. I booked a loss the next morning which was recouped in the next two trading days.No system will ever work fully. The game of trading is not about guaranteed profits but about the probability of making a profit. This is where option buying comes in.Q: Why have you selected options buying over options selling, which is what most traders do?A: There is a misconception that buying option is a losing trade. Let me explain the concept of option buying.The ‘Probability of Profit’ also known as POP in the trading world is only around 30 percent for an option buyer. POP is the probability of an option closing ITM on expiry. It also indicates that a trader will make a profit or barely breakeven only 30 percent of the time. This is also the reason why option selling is catching up as their POP is 70 percent.In trading, POP is all that matters. For an option buyer, it goes down with time and for an option seller, it increases with time. Thus, for an option buyer, it becomes imperative to trade only when the momentum is good. The Greek gods that an option buyer can worship are Delta and Gamma while Theta is their biggest enemy.An option buyer should not hold his position for a long time as Theta or time decay starts playing on the position and erodes its value. Secondly, an option buyer should buy such an option which has more intrinsic value than extrinsic value – which means a slightly in-the-money (ITM) contract. Further, your timing should be such that the momentum is strong and is building up. One needs to exit the trade as the momentum slows down. The only way an option buyer can end up with a winning trade is if the underlying stock or index moves significantly in his direction.If you are buying option in a trending market the Greeks Delta and Gamma in an option premium will ensure that they not only nullify the effect of Theta but also overpower it. I always enter a trade where the momentum is about to enter an active zone.The strikes that I chose to trade have a delta value between 0.3 and 0.6 and tend to avoid deep ITMs. I prefer to buy options with a high premium and sell them higher.If you time the option of buying right and select the right strike to trade, there is nothing that is as profitable as options buying. Unfortunately, most retail buyers tend to buy out-of-the-money (OTM) options and hold them till expiry which ends up worthless.The basic idea of being consistently profitable in option buying is not to fall into the trap of option sellers. In option buying the margin requirement is low, its risk is low but so is the POP. To keep the odds in my favour I keep on rotating the strikes as per the movement of the index.As compared to buying option selling option is a high-risk game, similar to selling earthquake insurance. All it takes is one earthquake to wipe out the profits of the insurance company.A quote from Nicholas Taleb’s book ‘Fooled by Randomness’ explains the risk associated with options selling. He says ""a 99.9 percent chance of winning a $1 bet over 1000 bets is not worth it if there is a 0.1 percent chance of losing $10,000. Over 1,000 chances you will win $999 but the one losing chance will take away $10,000.""A day like the one on which corporate tax cut was announced would be enough to wipe out an option sellers profit made throughout the year.Even the best and most knowledgeable option sellers could not save themself from these black swan events. The point here is we need to cover our bases for an unforeseen event. While in option buying the losses gives the buyer a chance to come back, an option seller can get wiped out.James Cordier from Optionsellers.com and author of ‘The complete guide to option selling’, one of the most popular sites on option selling, wrote to his investors recently about ‘Catastrophic loss event’ that he not only lost all their money but that they would also owe money for margin calls. This was after the sharp move in Natural Gas which caught him unaware. If such knowledgeable traders can go belly up, a retail trader has reason to be worried.Q: What is your options buying framework?A: There are a few criteria that need to be taken into consideration before buying options.Apart from the strike selection that we discussed above, implied volatility (IV) also needs to be looked into. If IV is high, ATM buying should be avoided. One must then buy shorter-term ITM options.Timing the entry is very important. While buying options, the objective is to minimise the amount of time of exposure in the market.Volatility skew is another thing to note which is used to identify opportunities to buy cheaper options. A negative skew for buying call options is preferable as it implies that IV increases as we move from higher strikes to lower strikes. Thus if you buy a call option and everything works in your favour and the call option moves deeper in the money the IV’s will go up taking your option premium higher.The ideal situation to enter if you are a buyer of a call option is to buy it on a pullback.Coming back to my momentum trading strategy I start building my position between 1.30-2.00. I will scale into my position as it moves in my direction. If the position is not moving in my direction and starts to hurt me I will be out of the trade.Since the move is sharp towards the end of the day, my premise is it will continue to do so at the start of the next day.For each day I have a fixed profit and loss target. After these targets are achieved I am sitting on the sidelines or taking small scalping trades. If I have earned, say Rs 1.30 lakh during the day as compared to my target of Rs 1 lakh, I will use the extra Rs 30,000 as my stop loss to the scalp.Q: How do you scalp in the market?A: Scalping has helped me become a better trader over time. I do scalping only in index options on account of high liquidity in them. There are small windows of opportunities to scalp every day which I try to capture.I start nibbling in a trade with a small quantity and only when it moves in my direction I will add to the position. Say if my signal is generated at Rs 200, I will add to the position at Rs 230 but if the option premium goes down to 170 I will start reducing my positions.Having said that scalping is not easy. You have to be cold-blooded in taking these trades. There may be an occasion when you have exited the trade and it still keeps on going up, you need to be happy that your target is met and that this was only a scalp trade. Changing the strategy is an easy temptation to scalpers and probably the reason for their downfall.I use four indicators for my scalping trades – Supertrend, MACD (moving average convergence divergence), ADX (Average Directional Index) and EIS (Elder’s impulse system) which helps speedy exits.I will hold on to the position until at least two of the indicators give me a sell signal.Q: What would you like to tell a retail trader struggling to get his act in place?"

title,Here’s why SMEs should go digital to grow their businesses
datetime,2020-03-02 16:41:00+00:00
description,"As per a Google-KPMG 2017 report, 68% of SMEs in India are offline and operate with traditional methods and legacy tools, Only 2% are digitally engaged."
content,"Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) form the backbone of the Indian economy and contribute immensely to the GDP numbers. As per the annual report of MSME ministry 2017-18, the sector, which has a vast network of 63.38 million enterprises, contributes more than 28% to the GDP and employs around 111 million people. In terms of volume, the SME sector stands next to the agriculture sector.Thus, the role of the sector cannot be emphasised enough, and if given the right push, it has the potential to contribute even more. MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari said in the years to come, it will be his endeavour to raise the contribution of the MSME sector to the country's GDP to 50%.NoneThat said, one of the ways that SMEs can grow further is through a digital transformation where business owners are willing to use the latest technology in their daily operations to drive efficiency, accuracy, innovation and reduce turnaround time. Although SMEs have started realising the benefits of the digital mode, still, the adoption is extremely low.As per a Google-KPMG 2017 report, 68% of SMEs in India are offline, have no digital presence and continue to operate with traditional methods and legacy tools, and just 2% are digital engaged.The numbers show that SMEs are still engaged in old practices and there is no digital uptake, which can be due to various reasons such as lack of awareness, lack of skilled labour, funds, low IT infrastructure, etc.But, there’s no denying the fact that digital opens up many avenues for SMEs. As per the report, digital SMEs grow revenues and profits up to twice as fast as offline counterparts, capture greater efficiencies, communicate effectively, reduce lead time, and more.Moreover, by adopting digital practices such as CRM, online payments, selling on e-commerce platforms, the latest machines at manufacturing units, etc., SMEs can meet client expectations and bring in innovation. By upgrading their IT infrastructure, business owners can reduce losses, improve employee productivity, enter new markets and make their companies agile.In a bid to support the SME sector for digital initiatives, the Indian government has taken several initiatives such as online filing of taxes (GST), a scheme for promotion of innovation, rural industries and entrepreneurship (ASPIRE), MSE-CDP platform, technology development centres providing skilling on cutting edge technology to MSME and more.Moneycontrol has also kickstarted an initiative to help SMEs to digitise their operations through Easybiz. Under Easybiz, SMEs can use tools and services such as customer management, invoicing, online collections, payment reconciliation, payment reminders and GST filing to simplify business operations and increase efficiency."

title,USFDA's new draft guidelines on insulin products to help biosimilar makers like Biocon
datetime,2019-12-03 20:53:00+00:00
description,"Once insulins are regulated as biologics or biosimilars, it will become possible for drug companies to seek interchangeable designations for their products. "
content,"NoneSo far, US-approved insulins are approved as “follow-on” drugs under Section 505(b)(2) pathway of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. But from March 2020 onwards, insulin products will be approved as biologics under the Biologics License Applications (BLA) pathway.Once insulins are regulated as biologics or biosimilars, it will become possible for drug companies to seek interchangeable designations for their products.For instance, Basaglar (a biosimilar of Sanofi’s basal insulin Lantus), sold by the Eli Lilly-Boehringer Ingelheim duo, is classified in the US as a “follow-on” drug. This makes it ineligible for interchange with Lantus.The same Basaglar is approved in Europe under the biosimilar pathway, thus making it eligible for substitution.This has resulted in higher-priced insulins for diabetes patients in the US, as Sanofi and Novo Nordisk had a stranglehold on the market.The USFDA, in its draft guidelines, also proposed the waiver of a comparative clinical immunogenicity study, in certain conditions for approval of biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products.In general, immunogenicity studies investigate the presence of an immune response to the therapeutic protein and its clinical impact, which can influence whether or not the therapy will work well and be safe.“This draft guidance is intended to help guide efficient product development by clarifying what data and information may – or may not – be needed to support a demonstration of biosimilarity or interchangeability for a proposed insulin product, as defined in the draft guidance,” USFDA said in a release.“The FDA is committed to continuing our efforts to help increase market competition among insulin products, which may potentially lower costs for patients and payors and increase access and product choice,” the agency added.Companies like Biocon, which are engaged in biosimilar development, have welcomed the development.“We welcome the decision of USFDA and believe it is a step in the right direction,” said Biocon Biologics spokesperson.“It will help companies like Biocon Biologics to take its high quality affordable Rhi and analogue insulins in its pipeline to the patients in the US faster. Biocon Biologics has been working with various stakeholders to enable this decision in the best interest of patients,” the spokesperson added."

title,Fill insurance forms yourself and make complete disclosures
datetime,2019-12-05 09:09:00+00:00
description,"In the Indian market, agents play a role in declaring mis-information in application forms."
content,"In my career in insurance industry, I have met hundreds of customers. I can safely say that 90 per cent of them did not read product brochures properly; neither did they fill the insurance application form themselves. I will talk about the latter in this article.An Insurance policy fundamentally is for protection against an “adverse event” occurring to the insured person. In life insurance, the adverse event could be death. It could be hospitalisation, surgery, etc. in a health policy. It could be a fire or accident in the case of property and motor vehicles insurance policies, respectively.Contract based on faithNoneThis is a critical responsibility of the customer for insurance to work. The insurance industry essentially aggregates the risks faced by thousands of individuals and by creating a portfolio of such individual risks; the overall risk is better managed in the portfolio. This means an insurance company is dealing with thousands, if not millions, of individuals. Each individual applies to the insurance company for a risk cover. Each application is scrutinised by the insurance company by experts for risks. This critical job is done by a special unit of insurance companies – under-writers. The under-writer scrutinises the application form and assesses whether the risk is worth under-writing. If yes, a policy is issued, else, the application is rejected. There is a third option – the under-writer may approve the application, but at a higher rate of premium. This is called charging up the premium. Today, there are sophisticated automated systems being built, but they are merely computer algorithms that do a human under-writer’s job. The nature of underwriting does not change.Once you understand this process, you will appreciate why, if you lie while filling the application form, the insurance company may deny you the claim. For example, if the customer states he/she is not a smoker and at time of his/her death, even if say the death was caused by heart failure, the insurance company has the right to reject the claim because smoking affects a person’s health in multiple ways.Being forthright while filling formsWhat data is important in your application form? In general, it is a good policy to be honest and straight-forward in replying to the questions asked in the application form. Age, common habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol etc. are common ones. Other health-related questions such as personal health history or surgery or illness, family health history etc. should be declared properly. If one has occupational hazards – people working in dangerous factories or in mining jobs – those must be disclosed. There is no penalty to doing this. The insurance company may query (sometimes) you regarding the nature of your prior illness but that does not necessarily mean it will reject your case.In the Indian market, agents play a role in declaring mis-information in application forms. Many of us are lazy to fill the form and we leave it to the agent. This is not a good idea. The agent may not know everything about you or your family and may take a short-cut in filling “blank” or “not applicable” answers to many important questions. This is wrong and you will suffer in the end, not the agent.You are buying insurance to have peace of mind, for securing your family. If you hide crucial data/information or declare what is untrue in your form, the chances of the claim getting approved are threatened. What is the point of taking insurance if after your death or accident, you or your family does not get the claim amount? The purpose itself is defeated. At worst, the may company charge you more premium due to the data you provided in the form. This is welcome, because then you know the benefit of claim cannot be denied to you or your family. Even if the policy is rejected, it is fine, as at least now, you as a customer have clarity. There is no false hope or security. For example, an applicant with severe diabetes or previous heart attack history may be rejected for fresh insurance. This may be disappointing, but still acceptable because in that case the customer will make alternative arrangements for his/her family.Honesty is indeed the best policy when it comes to filling an Insurance form!"

The Badshah Masala brand is owned by Jhaveri Industries and the promoters, the Jhaveri family, are looking to sell a controlling stake of 76 percent in the company to Capital Foods,"" a source told Moneycontrol."" The plan is for Hemant Jhaveri to make a complete exit by selling his entire 55 percent stake in the company. His cousin brother Kailash Jhaveri holds the remaining 45 percent stake and is set to make a partial exit by selling 21 percent stake,"" added another source.""Badshah Masala is one of the oldest spice brands in the country and has a massive network of points of sales. General Atlantic wants Capital Foods to expand aggressively into newer, additional segments of food ingredients,"" added a third source.Moneycontrol could not independently verify the value of the proposed transaction.Jhaveri Industries had revenues of around Rs 350-400 crores for FY19, as per reports.It sells 48 varieties of blended spices and ground spices ranging from red chilli powder to curry masala and has a manufacturing unit at Umbergaon, Gujarat. Exports to countries like USA, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania and Singapore account for a third of the firm's sales.Badshah Masala’s catchy jingle from the 90’s “ Swaadh Sugandh Ka Raja, Badshah Masala” made the brand a household name. The jingle was also used later on the Mumbai Western Railways suburban train network as part of a campaign. It competes with brands like Everest, MDH, Catch, Mothers Recipe, Priya and others in the Indian market.Ajay Gupta is the Managing Director of Capital Foods, and General Atlantic invested in the packaged foods company in mid-2018. Its popular Indo-Chinese ""Chings Secret"" brand also offers instant soups, chutneys and masalas. Capital Foods also owns the ""Smith & Jones"" brand of cooking pastes, pasta masala and pizza ketchup.In the consumer segment in India, General Atlantic has also invested in supermarket chain D-Mart, casual dining restaurant chain 'Absolute Barbecue' and maker of women's apparel and accessories 'House of Anita Dongre'. It has over $35 billion assets under management (AUM) and has been present in India since 2002. According to its website, other companies in its Indian portfolio include PNB Housing Finance, IIFL Wealth and Asset Management, Hexaware, Byju's and Jubilant Lifesciences amongst others.“The overall food market in India is growing annually at a rate of over 12 percent. It was worth $200 bn in 2016-17 and is expected to cross $540 bn by 2020. A new market for products such as breakfast cereals, pasta, infant food, bakery products, foreign liquor and different types of oils and sauces is driving the growth,” says Anil Talreja, Partner, Deloitte India.According to the 2017-18 annual report of the Spices Board India, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, the export of Indian spices continued its increasing trend and achieved an all-time record in both volume and value.“A total of 10,28,060 tonnes of spices and spice products valued at `17929.55 crores was exported from the country as against 9,47,790 tonnes valued at Rs 17,664.61 crores in 2016-17, registering an increase of 8 percent in volume,” the report said."

description,The study pointed out at an important finding – 60 percent of heavy television viewers also watch OTT daily. This means that OTT is an add-on. It compliments television and is not here to cannibalize TV.
content,"A recent study has pointed out that the growth of women viewers watching content on over the top (OTT) platforms is faster than that of men.According to Kantar OTT report, a data insights and consulting company, 58 percent men watch content on video streaming platforms but the their viewership growth has slowed down to eight percent from last year.On the other hand, female viewership on OTTs has grown by 14 percent from 2018. Now, as many as 42 percent Indian women watch content on streaming platforms.In addition, OTT consumers between the age of 15 and 19, 20 and 24 and 25 and 34 are seeing a decline in viewership growth by 15 percent, nine percent and six percent respectively.But, users between the age of 35 and 44 and 45 and 55 are seeing 18 percent and 63 percent growth in viewership respectively, as compared to that of last year.This indicates that a more mature audience is taking to OTT platforms to consume content. Looks like the efforts of video streaming platforms in getting more mature content is paying off.Another interesting insight shown by the study is that while the general notion is that consumers watch OTT content on the go, it is home-viewing that is seeing exponential growth.As many as 87 percent OTT viewers watch content at home as against 36 percent, who prefer watching their favorite shows and movies during their travel. Home-viewing has increased 75 percent from the last year and on-the-go-viewing has seen a 38 percent increase.Also, the prime-time slot reserved for television is now being shared by OTT content. The proof of this is that between 8 pm to 12 am, 81 percent viewers are on OTT platforms and 76 percent people watch television.Once a consumer gets hooked on to OTT, then as many as 55 percent consumers watch content on the platform daily.The study pointed out at an important finding – 60 percent of heavy television viewers also watch OTT daily. This means that OTT is an add-on. It compliments television and is not here to cannibalize TV."

description,"36 percent of all Bahar-ka-Khana (outside food) occasions with spouses/partners are order-ins, indicating that home is becoming the place of choice for spending a romantic evening."
content,"Did you know, when it comes to ordering food online, Biryani  is one of the the most preferred dishes among consumers?NoneThe survey which was conducted in 13 cities among 3,990 Indian consumers aged between 15-50 years, who consume out-of-home food at least once a month. Along with the top cuisine consumed, the survey revealed more interesting insights regarding online food consumption habits.NoneTwo in three non-home-cooked food occasions are either order-ins or take-aways. Trends are similar in metros and smaller towns, though takeaway is slightly higher beyond metros where delivery is relatively less well-spread owing to logistical challenges.Many restaurants, yet limited experimentation While online food delivery platforms offer a host of restaurants, 82 percent consumers stick to five or less restaurants when they are considering out of home food.“People don’t exercise options and this is an opportunity to look at how to make people experiment more,"" Sreyoshi Maitra, Executive Director, Ipsos told Moneycontrol.Adding to this, Bansi Kotecha, Head of Operations, India and SA, UberEats said that while young millennials are clear as to what they want to eat, they are willing to experiment.""There is a clear shift in how people look for what they want to eat. People earlier would look for a restaurant and then decide what they want to eat. Now, people search for a dish and then find a restaurant. There is a play here on how food tech players can let restaurants be discovered in a way that eaters are able to experiment from them,” he added.Breakfast - a missed opportunityOrdering for day meals and dinner may be a common affair on online food delivery platforms, but the same is not the case when it comes to morning meals.Around 82 percent consumers take home-cooked breakfast.Hence, breakfast comes across like a home delivery opportunity missed, which could be addressed by an array of hot and fresh morning meals, the report pointed out.Ordering food online- a matter of convenienceNot only has the concept of ordering-in become a matter of convenience, consumers are choosing better packaging to make the experience easier.This is why all-in-one meal bowls are preferred by one in three consumers. Specifically, for delivery, 51 percent order a combo meal or a meal-in-a-box.Plus, in case of ordered-in food, 35 percent eat straight out of the box.Have a date? Then why not order-in?NoneThis is clearer in the nature of the order too. Consumers spend more (order value being three times compared to a solo order and similar to a larger group order) and spend on other items apart from the basic meal, especially desserts."

description,"Searches were conducted in Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Jaipur after the I-T intelligence and criminal cell detected illiquid option trades"
content,"The Income Tax (I-T) Department is probing Future and Options (F&O) brokers, bogus entry players and beneficiaries of these bogus trades for evading long term capital gain (LTCG) tax.""I-T department conducted searches on brokers and beneficiaries over the past two days, and it may continue for another couple of days,"" a source close to the development told Moneycontrol.Searches were mainly conducted in Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Jaipur after the I-T intelligence and criminal cell detected illiquid option trades.In October 2018, the Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT) had written a letter to SEBI seeking information on the same. SEBI had in FY14-15 passed an order in regard to the matter.NoneUnderstanding the methodLet us understand this better with an example.For a derivative trade to be executed, a specific buy quantity by investor A has to be matched with a corresponding sale transaction by investor B. Now, trader A can get into an agreement with B to buy back the illiquid contract any time before expiry at a pre-determined higher price. This will result in profit in the books of A and an equivalent loss in B’s books.Trader A will now be able to convert his black money into white because of this profit, despite having to pay securities transaction tax and short-term capital gains on this profit. Though trader B incurred a loss, he will be paid off in black and can carry forward this loss for eight years, which can be set-off against future capital profits.History and similar casesThis is not the first time that I-T officials have suspected tax evasion via the capital markets. In FY14-15, the Director-General of Income Tax, Kolkata prepared a report detailing how penny stocks were used to evade LTCG tax of over Rs 80,000 crore.Later on, SEBI gave a clean chit to entities listed in the report, thus watering down the case. The market regulator at that time mentioned in its internal note to the SEBI board that they were only concerned with the price manipulation and not tax evasion, as the latter is under the I-T Department’s purview.In 2010, unique client code modifications worth Rs 55,000 crore per month were made on the NSE by 82 brokers in the equity, equity derivative and currency segments. This amount collectively is over several lakh crores.In September 2019, the I-T Department sent letters to stock exchanges, asking them to look more closely into cases of client code modifications to help spot tax evasion tactics.NoneI-T’s letter also states that exchanges should probe whether the requested client code modifications are intended for genuine purposes. The department’s renewed glare on client code modifications as a method to evade taxes comes after it its success in plugging another loophole of tax evasion.Modifications in client code – unique trading ID given to all clients – are required in case of a manual error on the part of investor or broker while punching in the client code at the time of order. For instance, a broker may have mixed up an order for Client A with that of Client B."

description,The MPV was spotted most recently under testing without camouflage.
content,"Ahead of the BSVI emission norms which will be implemented from April 1, 2020, Maruti Suzuki is gearing up to launch BSVI-compliant versions of its existing models. Among them is the Ertiga, whose diesel variant was recently spotted under testing on Indian roads.The MPV was spotted most recently under testing without camouflage. Maruti Suzuki has officially confirmed that it will discontinue the diesel engines in its lineup, due to the high costs of upgrading them to BSVI emission norms.However, contradictory to its statement, the new Ertiga was spotted with a diesel engine. Though it hasn’t been officially confirmed, it can be expected that the Indian carmaker will continue its 1.5-litre diesel engines.Currently, the Ertiga is equipped with a 1.5-litre DDiS diesel engine which makes 95PS of maximum power and 225Nm of peak torque. It is speculated that the new Ertiga will get a Fiat-sourced 1.6-litre DDiS engine which makes 120PS of maximum power and 320Nm of peak torque.Diesel powertrains are preferred by a majority of MPVs currently sold in India. Hence, discontinuing the diesel option for Ertiga would serve as a major hurdle to the company’s sales. However, it is unlikely that it will receive the company’s 1.6-litre Multijet diesel engine as the company seems to have spent a significant amount on making its 1.5-litre DDiS engine BSVI compliant."

title,Zhili has become the children’s garment centre of the world
datetime,2019-12-04 19:40:00+00:00
description,"Zhili has managed to free itself from the clutches of some of the crudest forms of industrialization and return to its ancient roots that lay in weaving, knitting and pastoral settings."
content,"Today, Zhili town is the largest centre in China for making children’s garments. The town and its surroundings exhibit lush greenery, ever-flowing streams and clean roads. But it wasn’t always so.Located in the hinterland of China's Yangtze river delta economic circle, Zhili town covers an area of 90 square kilometres with a permanent resident population of more than 450,000. It squats in the midst of three waters – the Tau Tang in the South, Taihu lake in the North, and Beihengtang in the middle. True to the adage that water breeds life, the region developed ancient water systems. In 2016, the neighbouring Yigao village was selected as a model irrigation village by the World Heritage Foundation. This village was famous for its weaving, and water transport through the nearby Hujiong harbour gave it access to markets.But in between the past and the present came short-sighted industrialisation. Three decades ago, the area known as Zhili and the adjoining Yu village in Zhejiang province were hostages to some of the crudest forms of industrialisation. Many still remember that there used to be a 30,000-square-meter quarry in the vicinity. It had abandoned its ancient roots that lay in weaving, knitting and pastoral settings. It used to embrace embroidery, shipbuilding, book printing and book trading industry in older times.NoneThe neighbourhood changed. Streams were cleaned up and greenery was protected. The quarries and mines went. In came fabrics, weaving, knitting and garments. Over the past 20 years, it has attracted numerous wholesalers from all over the country to make their purchases at the Zhili south gate.  In the north cashmere sweaters are popular.Garment weaving and hi-tech industries nestle together. Electronics, robotics and e-commerce are the new non-polluting industries around today. Some of them have become suppliers to the world’s top 500 companies such as Apple, Belsen, Hitachi, Sumitomo, Foxconn, BlueThink Technology, and Bourne optical.Hitech has blended into garment making as well. In Zhili you can witness the magic of a child’s dress being readied in just 45 seconds. Intelligent production and logistics further add to the bottom line of this industry.  On an average 3,000 children’s clothes are transported out of weaving in out of Zhili every minute. The town is busy -- even at night.The garment industry is huge.  In 2018, according to Xinhua, it produced 1.3 billion pieces/sets of children's clothes produced and sold by over 13,000 companies with annual sales reaching 50 billion yuan (about US$ 7.33 billion).  Not all of it gets exported.  China has a bustline and attractive domestic market as well.Zhili alone has around 20,000 are children.  In 2018, China alone accounted for 246 million children/ This is expected to reach around 250 million by 2023. The sales volume of China's children's wear market reached 160 billion yuan (US$ 22.75 billion – each yuan is approximately Rs.10). and this is expected to grow to 265.5 billion yuan (US$37.7 bn) in 2020.That could explain why the biggest children’s garment brand in Zhili – QiruiDeze  -- prefers to sell only to the domestic market.  But, according to Li Yun Pin, Chairman, and owner of the QiruiDeze brand, he is considering exports – especially to Africa.  He is also considering shifting some of his production base to Vietnam or Laos  -- not India – to cope with increasing costs of Chinese labour.  Studies are underway.  Wherever automation reduces costs, it will be adopted. The rest could go overseas.  But India is important as a market.  That is why he has begun looking for dealerships in this country as well.He, like many other garment manufacturers, admits that were it not for Zhili, he might not have grown so big and so quickly.  He has self-financed this brand and has around 1,600 stores (owned and franchisee) across China – all within 15 years. He employs around 5,000 people, but refuses to discuss investments (“my people are my biggest investment”, he says smilingly). “We will add more stores in years to come, and we will expand overseas as well,” adds Li. He admits that there are bigger players than him in the country, notably Balabala, which grew over four decades outside of Zhili. It has sales of 65 billion yuan ($8.8 bn) compared to his own 5 billion yuan ($711 million). But he is confident of becoming a 100 billion yuan company ($14.2 bn) within the next five years.With garment sales zooming, the growth of the e-commerce sector was inevitable.  Even Li wants to sell through the internet – through stores like Alibaba and Amazon -- by next year. Currently, the number of e-commerce shops has swelled to 10,000.All this resulted in more jobs – and accommodation/construction -- for workers who came here from other provinces. More than three-fourths of the population comes from other provinces – and are quaintly called immigrants. To ensure that there are no disputes on account of different cultural backgrounds, social governance has played a significant part. The aim is to prevent crime. Penalising culprits is a next step that comes in only when the first has failed.At the core of all this development is the search for the best talent, because no industry can survive without attracting the best of talent. That is a lesson India needs to learn even as political parties clamour for reserving 80 percent of jobs for locals.Most people talk of Zhino. She is the fabled daughter of a weaver who fell in love with a cowherd. Their romance was forbidden because both came from different communities. Hence both were banished. Today, there are operas and stories about how the two can be found at either end of a road called the Milky Way.The romance finds its way into a booming child population in Zhili. And fashion parades in Zhili are also unusual. They have children strutting the stage. That has caused a market for child models to flourish. They can earn as much as $1,500 a day. But China does not want its children without education. Its social governance system steps in when a child misses school. Business must grow. But not at the cost of the future generation.The author is consulting editor with Moneycontrol."

title,Here’s how Pet Fed – a festival for your furry friends – is becoming big in India
datetime,2019-12-04 20:15:00+00:00
description,Growth in both ticketing and sponsorship revenue is one reason for the optimism.
content,"Don't you like to step out of the confines of your house for a breath of fresh air and some entertainment to go with it? Your pet can have the same desire. What are the options, you ask? Maybe a walk in the park or an excursion to a pet-friendly restaurant, which is not only hard to find but also has not much to offer to keep your furry friends entertained.A big break for your pet could be taking them to the Pet Fed Festival, which is the only pet festival in India offering fashion shows, security dog show, off-leash play area, cat zone, pet care stalls and more.Started in 2014 by Akshay Gupta, who thought that a pet festival would be right in India as the country is not very pet friendly, is taking the festival to more cities after seeing strong traction in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru.Talking to Moneycontrol, Gupta said that the agenda is to be present in at least 10 cities in India.“We are also present in Pune, Chandigarh and Hyderabad, but this year, we have smaller events there. Next year, we will have the main festival there as well. The growth for the festival is steep because we add new cities every year and next year, we will be present in five cities,” he said.He added that a lot of queries are coming from smaller towns like Gwalior, Ahmedabad, Surat, and Indore to have a Pet Fed there.What makes Gupta so optimistic about the growth of the Pet fed Festival?Growth in both ticketing and sponsorship revenue is one reason for the optimism.Initially, the ticketing revenue was growing at about 25 percent every year. Now, it grows at about 12 percent. “So, seven to eight percent is organic footfall growth. There is also an increase in the price of tickets every year. We increase the price of the ticket by Rs 50 every year. So, the overall increase comes up to about 12 percent hike YoY in ticketing revenue. The ticketing revenue is around Rs 60 lakh per city,” added Gupta.Currently, the ticket price is Rs 400 per person.In terms of sponsorship, he said that the festival is seeing sharper growth. In absolute numbers, the exhibition revenue makes up for Rs 90 lakh to Rs 95 lakh per city.As many as 220 brands across the three cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru) associate with the festival each year.“We have about 120-140 different brands. Plus, there are brands that are repeated across cities,” added Gupta.Rise in ticketing and sponsorship revenue are an indicator of a strong footfall at the festival.In 2017, Pet Fed saw 20,000 visitors in Delhi alone, which went up to 21,500 last year and 22,500 visitors are expected to attend the festival this year.“In the first two years, we saw very sharp growth and the footfall used to grow 20 percent every year. Since then, it has been growing but at a pace of about 7 - 8 percent per annum,” said Gupta.While the exhibition or sponsorship has been at the lower end in 2019, Gupta is expecting the usual growth of 25 percent this year as he believes that the pet industry is nascent in India and hence far from saturation.This year, Pet Fed visited Bengaluru and is now coming to Mumbai and Delhi on December 28 -29 and January 11 and 12, 2020 respectively.Delhites, if you are planning to visit the festival, remember that the Delhi Police Crime Branch is performing at the police dog show with 12 dogs and 22 officers."

content,"NoneNone“From time to time, (we) keep exploring various options for sustainable growth of the Company,” the company told exchanges. It did not deny these reports.The possible sale is expected to ease Wockhardt’s financial woes to some extent. So far, its promoters have been infusing funds to ensure that the company doesn’t default on its debt repayment obligations. In FY19, they infused Rs 250 crore in the form of redeemable preference shares, in order to refinance the company’s outstanding preference debt.However, the company’s operating performance continues to be worrisome. In the first half of FY20, Wockhardt’s sales dropped 22 percent and losses widened to Rs 127 crore as against that in the same period of the previous year. The company has been incurring losses for the last three consecutive financial years on a consolidated basis.In the last one year, Wockhardt shares on the BSE have shed nearly half their value. On December 2, shares of Wockhardt closed at Rs 254.55, declining 1.24 percent on the BSE.“The ratings continued to be tempered by weak operating performance resulting in continued losses (though the net loss has declined in FY19 and Q1FY20), substantial decrease in cash and cash equivalents as well as the company's exposure to regulated markets especially the USA, which is witnessing increased competition resulting into pricing pressure,” said Care Ratings, while revising the ratings on long term bank facilities from negative BBB- to BB+ stable in September.However, a month before this, another ratings agency, India Ratings, had downgraded the drugmaker’s credit ratings from BBB- to BB+. The ratings firm issued a negative outlook, citing significantly elevated refinancing risks for Wockhardt in H2FY20 due to its weak liquidity position for servicing its upcoming debt maturities over the same period.Wockhardt isn’t losing hopeThe company, during the half year ended September 30, 2019, said it had repaid Rs 408 crore towards various long term debt obligations as per schedule.“Total long term outstanding debts as on September 20, 2019 were Rs 2,098 crore as compared to Rs 2,789 crore as on September 30, 2018 and Rs 2,469 crore as on 31st March, 2019,” Wockhardt said.Its gross debt to equity ratio as on September 2019 stood at 0.94. Wockhardt employs over 7,000 people and has a presence in the US, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, France, Mexico, Russia and many other countries. Around 72 percent of the company’s revenues comes from exports.Why Wockhardt ended up in this stateWockhardt, which sounds German, derived its name from Worli Chemicals. Founded in 1967 by Habil Khorakiwala, it went on to become India’s fifth largest drug company by revenues.However, the company’s bets on complex currency derivatives pushed it into deep trouble, with mounting debt and huge losses towards 2008.The company moved to the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) cell in the first half of 2009. To clean up its balance sheet, Wockhardt had to sell its nutrition business to French FMCG major Danone for $356 million. Also, group company Wockhardt Hospitals sold part of its hospital chain to Fortis for Rs 909 crore in order to repay loans.In what can be seen as a remarkable turnaround story, Wockhardt was back in the pink by early 2011. In next two years, it grew at an aggressive pace, focusing on the US generic market.But issues of data integrity and those related to regulatory compliance at its plants once again rocked the company. By November 2019 end, seven of Wockhardt’s facilities were placed under regulatory restrictions by the USFDA.Two of its flagship formulation facilities – in Waluj and Chikalthana in Maharashtra, continue to be under import alerts since 2013.The other facility in Waluj received a warning letter in 2013. Also, facilities under Wockhardt’s subsidiaries CP Pharmaceuticals Limited (UK) and Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals Inc. (US) were issued warning letters in FY17.Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals and the facilities in Waluj contribute around 80 percent to the sales to its US markets.While Wockhardt’s facilities continue to be compliant as per other regulatory authorities, the US regulatory problems put breaks on its growth story."

content,"At the recently concluded 2019 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda had showcased an off-road moped concept based on the Super Cub 125. Dubbed the CT125, the company has entered the moped into production.The Japanese automobile manufacturer will revive the ‘CT’ nameplate which had been defunct since 2008. The new moped is expected to be equipped with a 124cc, single-cylinder engine which does duty in the Euro-spec Super Cub 124. It should make 9.65PS of maximum power and 10.4Nm of peak torque while being mated to a 4-speed gearbox.Honda had showcased the concept scooter with a scrambler-like high-set exhaust, spoke wheels, dual-purpose tyres, and a bash plate. However, it is yet to be confirmed that Honda will be offering these accessories as standard after its launch.After Honda launches the CT125, it will be able to offer a wider range of products across multiple power segments. The moped will not have any direct competition since there are no significant off-road based mopeds on sale in the market. The CT125 will pose as a more durable option for people who like to take their scooters off the road."

description,"If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA's executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said."
content,"The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) slapped a four year ban on Russia from all major sporting events for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019. The ban means Russia will not be able to participate in the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the football 2022 World Cup in Qatar.Russia has been under investigation following a 2015 report commissioned by WADA which uncovered evidence of mass doping among Russian athletes. In September 2018, WADA lifted the three-year suspension which followed the state-sponsored doping scandal, over conditions which included Russia providing access to laboratory data and samples.WADA's executive committee have now taken the decision of enforcing the ban after concluding that Moscow had tampered with the laboratory data it submitted by planting fake evidence and deleting files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats.A spokesperson for WADA committee's said the decision to punish Russia with a ban was unanimous.Russia, which has tried to showcase itself as a global sports power, has been embroiled in doping scandals since 2015 when whistleblower and former head of Moscow's anti-dopting laboratory Grigory Rodchenkov revelaed that Russian intelligence services had helped by devising a way of opening and resealing urine containers previously believed to be tamper-proof.NoneNoneNoneThe sanctions imposed on December 9 had been recommended by WADA's compliance review committee in response to the doctored laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year.One of the conditions for the reinstatement of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which was suspended in 2015 in the wake of the athletics doping scandal but reinstated last year, had been that Moscow provide an authentic copy of the laboratory data.The sanctions effectively strip the agency of its accreditation.Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov last month attributed the discrepancies in the laboratory data to technical issues.The punishment, however, leaves the door open for clean Russian athletes to compete at major international sporting events without their flag or anthem for four years, as was the case during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have branded the call for sanctions unfair and likened it to broader Western attempts to hold back the country.If RUSADA appeals the sanctions endorsed by WADA's executive committee, the case will be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), WADA has said."

title,Aramco IPO: Shares indicated up 10% from IPO price ahead of debut

description,The sale of 1.5 percent of Aramco is the bedrock of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious strategy to overhaul the oil-reliant economy.
content,"Saudi Aramco shares were indicated at 35.2 riyal ($9.39) each in the pre-market auction on December 11, 10 percent above their initial public offering (IPO) price of 32 riyals.Saudi Aramco's shares began trading domestically on December 11, after the energy behemoth raised $25.6 billion in the world's biggest initial public offering.Aramco had priced its IPO at 32 riyals ($8.53) per share, the high end of the target range, surpassing the $25 billion raised by Chinese retail giant Alibaba in its 2014 Wall Street debut.The sale of 1.5 percent of the firm, or three billion shares, is the bedrock of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious strategy to overhaul the oil-reliant economy.A 10 percent increase in the share price would take its market capitalisation closer to the $2 trillion price tag long sought by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange held an opening auction for Aramco shares for an hour from 9:30 (0630 GMT) followed by continuous trading.The company said Friday it could exercise a ""greenshoe"" option, selling additional shares to bring the total raised up to $29.4 billion.The market launch puts the oil behemoth's value at $1.7 trillion, far ahead of other firms in the trillion-dollar club, including Apple and Microsoft.But the scaled-down IPO is still a far cry from the blockbuster originally planned by Prince Mohammed.The much-delayed stock sale, first announced in 2016, was initially expected to raise as much as $100 billion from the sale of up to five percent of the company. The government's plans to raise additional funds by listing on a major international market are also on hold.The IPO fell short of Prince Mohammed's desired $2 trillion valuation. But the government is trying to persuade wealthy families and institutions to buy Aramco shares after it floats in a last-ditch effort to reach the $2 trillion mark, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.The Saudi government itself has pumped in huge funds to boost the IPO, which was originally intended to raise external funding for the kingdom's diversification plan.Two-thirds of the shares were offered to institutional investors. Saudi government bodies accounted for 13.2 percent of the institutional tranche, investing around $2.3 billion, according to lead IPO manager Samba Capital.The IPO is a crucial part of Prince Mohammed's plan to wean the economy away from oil by pumping funds into megaprojects and non-energy industries such as tourism and entertainment.But sceptics say the proceeds will barely cover the kingdom's budget deficit for a year.The IPO was heavily focused on Saudi and other Gulf traders. International investors have remained sceptical about the secretive company's targeted valuation. The IPO also comes with oil prices under pressure due to a sluggish global economy hit by the US-China trade war and record output by non-OPEC crude exporters."

description,"You can get the entry-level configuration at $5,999. "
content,"Apple’s revamped Mac Pro workstation and Pro Display XDR high-end monitor recently went on sale. While the monitor is expensive in its own rank, the new Mac Pro will end up costing you a small fortune if you opt for the top-end model. The Mac Pro is designed to bring Apple back to the forefront of high-performance Pro workstations, but it comes at a pretty hefty price.The Mac Pro workstation starts at $5,999 (Approx. Rs 4,25,300) while maxing out the spec sheet on the machine will set you back $52,599 (Approx. Rs 37,28,800). And that’s without the monitor, which costs an additional $4,999 (Roughly Rs 3,35,500). Not to mention, the monitor doesn’t come with a stand or VESA mount adapter, that is priced at $999 (Approx. Rs 70,900) and $199 (Approx. Rs 14,200), respectively.On the performance front, the Mac Pro can be outfitted with an Intel Xeon W processor with anywhere between eight to 28 cores. The entry-level Mac Pro comes with 32GB of 2933MHz RAM, but the twelve 128GB user-replaceable slots will allow you to add up to 1.5TB of RAM. The Mac Pro supports 4TB of SSD storage, split across two 2TB SSDs with Apple claiming an 8TB option will be available in the future.In terms of graphics, Apple’s professional desktop packs an AMD Radeon Pro 580X GPU to start with. However, graphics can be upgraded to the newer Radeon Pro W5700X or twin AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo GPUs with 2x32GB HBM2 memory each, which takes the tally to four graphics cards and eight display outputs. Additionally, the Afterburner accelerator card and wheels for the Mac Pro will set you back $2,000 (Approx. Rs 1,41,800) and $400 (Approx. Rs 28,400), respectively."

description,"Without naming anyone, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also underscored the need for coming out of the psyche that one should get only a lucrative portfolio in the government ""to serve the state or country"", and questioned the intention of such leaders."
content,"Ahead of the Maharashtra Cabinet expansion, the Shiv Sena on Monday said old guards are not ready to give up ministerial berths for young leaders and they should come out of the illusion that the state government cannot do without them.Without naming anyone, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also underscored the need for coming out of the psyche that one should get only a lucrative portfolio in the government ""to serve the state or country"", and questioned the intention of such leaders.It, however, named senior Congress leaders like Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan and NCP's Ajit Pawar, who are being seen as contenders for Cabinet berths in the second round of expansion.The state Cabinet expansion is likely to take place after the state legislature's winter session, which begins in Nagpur on Monday and will conclude on December 21.The editorial expressed surprise at party president and Chief Minister Thackeray Uddhav Thackeray not keeping the key Home department with himself, as had been the practice.Thackeray's predecessor Devendra Fadnavis had kept the portfolio with himself.The Shiv Sena said re-allocation of portfolios will take place during the Cabinet expansion.The Sena, NCP and Congress formed government in the state by joining hands after the October 21 Assembly polls under the banner of the 'Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi'.The Shiv Sena, which is leading the government, said former state chief ministers Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan are keen on joining Thackeray's Council of Ministers.The question is as to which departments befitting (their stature) should be given to them, it said.""It will be a trapeze act to incorporate Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan during Cabinet expansion and re- allocation of portfolios,"" the Marathi daily said.It said NCP heavyweights like Ajit Pawar, Dilip Walse Patil, Rajesh Tope, Nawab Malik and others are also in the contention for ministerial berths.""The Shiv Sena, too, will have to pick leaders (for ministerial positions) from among its old hands and young turks. It is expected that fresh faces come into Maharashtra's politics...but the old guards are not ready to let go of chairs for youngsters,"" the Thackeray-led party said.Without naming anyone, it said, ""Big people should come out of the illusion that Maharashtra or the government cannot do without them.""Noting that the Fadnavis government is no more there in Maharashtra, the Sena said it is not that the state is unable to do without it.Those who think that only lucrative portfolios can help serve the state or the country do not have ""clean intentions"", it remarked.Government departments like relief, rehabilitation, information technology, skill development, school education and health are also important, but nobody is ready to take charge of them, the Sena alleged, without naming its allies.""The definitions of words 'public services' and 'state's interest' need to be changed if the jousting is only for portfolios like home, urban development, public works and irrigation, thinking that holding these portfolios only marks the epitome of life,"" it said in sarcastic remarks.The Sena alleged that the previous Fadnavis government ensured its sustainability through the home department and the BJP's growth through the urban development department.""It used home department as if (the department) was its own employee and party workers...but the government has changed now. The chief minister has not kept much for himself and allocated portfolios with rather generosity. Hope the Nagpur session is successful! It definitely will be,"" it said.As per the portfolio-sharing arrangement decided by the Sena and its allies NCP and Congress, the Thackeray-led party has got home, urban development, forest, environment, agriculture, industries and higher and technical education, and parliamentary affairs departments.The NCP has been allocated finance and planning, housing, public health, irrigation, rural development and social justice departments.Besides, the Congress has been given revenue, energy, PWD, tribal welfare, women and child welfare, textile, relief and rehabilitation."

title,Samsung Galaxy A51 vs A50s vs A50: What's the difference?
datetime,2020-01-22 16:06:00+00:00
description,"The similarities between the Galaxy A50, A51 and A50s make it pretty hard to pick either one of the three phones."
content,"PerformanceOn the performance front, the Galaxy A50s and Galaxy A51 get the same 10nm Exynos 9611 SoC with both offering 6GB RAM. The Galaxy A50, on the other hand, gets an older 10nm Exynos 9610 chipset. Now, because Indian prices for the Galaxy A51 have not yet been released and the 6GB version costs little over Rs 24K in Vietnam, we’d have to give the Galaxy A50s the benefit of the doubt.CamerasIn terms of optics, both the Galaxy A50 and A50s pack triple rear cameras, while the Galaxy A51 gets a quad-camera setup. In terms of capabilities, the Galaxy A51 does have the upper hand, but it is barely ahead of the A50s. Apart, from the macro lens, there aren’t any big differences here. If we had to pick on of the three phones, we’d go with the Galaxy A51. One more thing to consider here is price, and for the price, we feel the Galaxy A50 has a better camera than its counterparts.Design and DisplayAll three phones look pretty sleek but feature plastic bodies. Additionally, displays specifications are also pretty similar across all three devices. However, the Galaxy A51 gets a punch-hole display rather than the waterdrop notch on the Galaxy A50 and A50s. Moreover, the A51 also sports a 20:9 aspect ratio as opposed to the 19.5:9 aspect ratio on the other two devices. If nothing else, the punch-hole notch does have a more modern feel to it.VerdictThe similarities between the Galaxy A50, A51 and A50s make it pretty hard to pick either one of the three phones. On paper, the Galaxy A51 and Galaxy A50s are pretty hard to tell apart, with the most noticeable changes on the A51 coming in the form of a punch-hole display and fourth macro lens.The Galaxy A51 also runs on Android 10 with the One UI 2.0 skin out of the box. Since the pricing of the device hasn’t been revealed to Indian audiences, we believe it won’t exceed Rs 23,000 for the base variant. The improvements on the Galaxy A51 seem minor over the A50s, and we don't recommend getting it if the price exceeds Rs 20K in India."

description,"""As the industry moves toward EVs, profits from large SUVs will help pay for investments,"" GM President Mark Reuss said. "
content,"General Motors Co (GM) could expand the lineup of vehicles using its large truck and sport utility vehicle (SUV) architecture and sees big opportunities in over-the-air software updates, President Mark Reuss told Reuters on December 10.GM, which controls about 70 percent of the large SUV market in North America with six models, unveiled the redesigned Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban. These are the first of a new generation of large SUVs whose profits will help fund the development of electric vehicles (EVs) from the automaker in the future.The 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, revealed at the arena where the Detroit Red Wings hockey team plays in downtown Detroit, is 6.7 inches longer than the current Tahoe and can carry as much as 122.9 cubic feet of cargo. Passengers in the third row of seats get 10 inches more legroom and a better ride thanks to a more car-like independent rear suspension.The new Chevy Suburban will grow by 1.3 inches to 225.7 inches long - making it one of the longest passenger vehicles on the market. GM's big SUVs will be powered by eight-cylinder gasoline engines or six-cylinder diesel motors.The vehicles have a new digital electronic architecture that enables over-the-air software updates and new revenue opportunities, Reuss told Reuters.""It is huge,"" Reuss said of the potential to sell customers new digital functions or avoid warranty repairs with a software update. Electric car maker Tesla Inc has used over-the-air upgrades as money makers and to fix problems at low cost.""As the industry moves toward EVs, profits from large SUVs will help pay for investments,"" Reuss said. Those include GM's plans to build a new battery plant and offer an electric pick-up truck.The new SUVs are assembled at a complex in Arlington, Texas, a state where many of them will be sold. GM has invested $1.4 billion (£1.09 billion) to expand the Arlington operation, and that gives the company the option to manufacture additional models, Reuss said.""We do not want to invest that much..and not have agility,"" he said.The Tahoe and Suburban unveilings cap a substantial investment by GM over the past five years in its largest pickup trucks and SUVs. GM's Detroit rivals, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, are also expanding their large SUV lineups, even as they promise more electrified cars for the future.Detroit automakers are doubling down again on big SUVs for a simple reason: It pays.The Arlington, Texas factory is running 24 hours a day to meet demand, and profit margins on large SUVs can be as high as 30 percent, or more than $15,000 a vehicle, industry executives and analysts said. Barclays estimated large pickup trucks and SUVs accounted for 72 percent of GM's North American profit in 2018.GM did not disclose pricing or fuel consumption data on the new SUVs, but the average Tahoe sold for $57,414 in November, according to data from ALG, a unit of TrueCar.US fuel economy rules, instituted under President Barack Obama, encourage automakers to make SUVs even bigger. Vehicles that have larger ""footprint"" because they are long and wide have easier mileage and CO2 emissions targets to meet.President Donald Trump has said he wants to ease vehicle CO2 standards but has not released a final plan. GM has sided with Trump on fuel economy policy in a dispute with California, which has sued to maintain the stronger Obama era standards.GM's sales of big utilities through the end of November were roughly steady year over year, according to sales figures from Automotive News.But GM faces tougher competition in the segment going forward. Ford has boosted sales of its competing Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large utilities by 45 percent through November 30. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV plans to launch a new Grand Wagoneer in 2021."

description,"According to brand strategist Harish Bijoor, “The bet is more on Dabangg 3 than on Salman Khan. If Dabangg 3 is a hit, this decision is a hit as well.”"
content,"It looks like Salman Khan has a new addition to his brand portfolio as the actor has been roped in by Pepsi, according to The Economic Times.NoneBut, is this the right move by Pepsi?NoneNoneNone“Pepsi could be doing this for tactical reasons. Maybe they want to open the lower segment of the market. Market for colas is declining in metros as youth in metros prefer healthier options. But, probably in tier II and III towns, there is an appeal of colas, which might score and there Salman will definitely help,” said Kanchan.He added for the last few campaigns Pepsi did not have celebrities so maybe the company wants to over-compensate by taking on Salman Khan.However, he thinks that, from the branding perspective, there does not seem to be synergy.NoneHe added that it is not the first time Pepsi is using an older star. They did get Amitabh Bachchan on board, but they used him as an add-on celebrity. He was never the face of Pepsi. This is why taking on Salman Khan looks like going against their (Pepsi’s) strategy kind of a move. But, given Salman’s popularity, it may help them break the clutter,” he added.Bijoor also said that Salman being invited by Pepsi is an endorsement of the fact that 53 is the new 23. He added, “Salman brings his distinctive attitude to the table, and attitude is everything, not physical age.”But, age was a factor when Khan was replaced by Ranveer Singh to endorse Thums Up. Until three years ago, Khan was endorsing the rival cola brand, but the contract was not renewed as the brand decided to sign Singh who symbolized youth.Losing Thums Up left Khan with not many big brands. Currently, he has around eight brands including BharatPe, Somany Ceramics, CP Plus, Image Eyewear, Dixcy Scott, Astral Pipes, Bahamas range of slippers by Relaxo and Emami’s edible oil range.With Pepsi’s addition, Khan’s endorsement game is getting stronger. He has probably entered the space later than most of his peers."

description,"While the market is abuzz on what could be stopping them from closing the deals, here's a look at five reasons why the country's fourth largest private lender is not able to attract interest from top quality investors:"
content,"NoneMoreover, the list of lesser-known investors got a big thumbs down from markets on concerns that they might not fit the bill as per regulatory norms.While the market is abuzz on what could be stopping them from closing the deals, here's a look at five reasons why the country's fourth-largest private lender is not able to attract interest from top-quality investors:No relief from stressed assetsThe Indian banking sector has been marred with rising bad loans and high provisioning requirements. Investors are on a lookout for banks with relatively cleaner balance sheets. In such a scenario, Yes Bank reported slippages of Rs 12,175 crore in the first half of FY20, the highest as compared to other private lenders.Regulatory lapsesThe lender reported bad loan divergences of Rs 3,277 crore for the financial year 2018-19. The divergence in net NPAs stood at Rs 2,299 crore, which was 51 percent of the net NPAs reported by the bank. The bank also reported divergence in provisioning at Rs 978 crore as on March 2019. This was the third such year where bad loans assessed by the regulator were higher than those reported by the bank.Liquidity under pressureLast week, Moody's downgraded Yes Bank's issuer ratings and bank deposit ratings and lowered the outlook to negative on concerns that the likely slippages and low loss-absorbing buffers against bad loans, will add pressure to its funding and liquidity in future. The global rating agency also said Yes Bank's position in this area compares weakly to its peers and may come under pressure if the bank does not strengthen its solvency in coming quarters.Capital woes unlikely to end soonEven if the bank is able to go ahead with its plan to raise $2 billion now, it will take more to restore the capital adequacy levels. As per Macquarie's estimates, the capital required by the bank could go up to $3-3.5 billion over the next 18 months, if fresh slippages are not contained. Investors face the risk of continued dilution going ahead.Legacy under threatYes Bank's founder and former chief Rana Kapoor's role in extending certain loans came under scanner after allegations of irregularities were raised by a whistleblower. While the audit conducted by JLN US & Co. was inconclusive, reports suggest fresh investigations have been sought into the matter.Kapoor stepped down from the top post in January 2019, as the banking regulator did not extend his appointment on grounds of weak governance and compliance issues. Kapoor also lost the promoter tag after he offloaded Yes Bank's shares in tranches, leading to an unceremonious exit from the bank in less than a year.The bank's rapid growth in a short span despite a challenging business environment and its significance in the country's banking system seems to be the only saving grace amid all uncertainties.However, it remains to be seen if Gill can bank upon this franchise to raise some good quality capital and steer the lender out of troubled waters soon."

description,The Bill does away with provision for nominating Anglo-Indians to Lok Sabha and some state assemblies
content,"NoneAccording to the report, the organisation has raised objections to Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's claim that there are just 296 members of the community in the country and stated that there are ""several lakhs of Anglo-Indians"" in India.The Bill seeks to extend by ten years the reservation given to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Lok Sabha and state assemblies. It was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 9. The Bill also proposes to do away with provision for nomination of Anglo-Indians in the Lower House and some state assemblies.""We accessed the government data which is from 2011 census. It shows nine Anglo Indians in West Bengal. There are probably more than that in my own family,"" Barry O Brien, the organisation’s president-in-chief told the newspaper.Barry, who is the brother of Trinamool Congress Member of Parliament (MP) Derek, added that while the data shows that there are zero Anglo-Indians in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, those Assemblies have sitting members from the community.""Did the state government nominate non Anglo-Indians? How can they?"" Barry said, adding that a petition started by the organisation has 750 signatures of Anglo-Indians.""The truth is nobody knows how many Anglo Indians there are in the country. All we know is it's not just a few thousand... It’s probably somewhere in the lakhs,"" Barry said.In a letter to Prasad, according to the report, Barry has said that the organisation had documentary evidence to prove that the number of Anglo-Indians in India is ""far greater"" than 296.""It is unfathomable as to WHY this drastic step of amending the constitution has been taken,"" Barry has said in the letter, according to the report.""What appears to have shattered our community today is the suddenness with which this is being done and the fact that not a single Anglo-Indian leader or member of the community has been consulted, nor has a justification been offered before going in for this amendment. Why has the community been kept completely in the dark?"" the letter adds. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.Article 331 of the Indian Constitution provides for the nomination of two Anglo-Indians to the Lok Sabha.""Notwithstanding anything in Article 81, the President may, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community is not adequately represented in the House of the people, nominate not more than two members of that community to the House of the People,"" it states."

datetime,2019-12-14 10:32:00+00:00
description,Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in US crashes since 2016.
content,"The US auto safety agency on December 13 said it will investigate a 12th Tesla crash that may be tied to the vehicle's advanced Autopilot driver assistance system after a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut on December 7.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) special crash investigation program will investigate the December 7 crash of a 2018 Tesla Model 3 on Interstate 95 in Norwalk, Connecticut, the agency confirmed.Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in US crashes since 2016. The agency's special crash investigation team inspected 12 crashes involving Tesla vehicles where it was believed that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the incident. In one of those, however, it was later found that Autopilot had not been engaged.To date, the agency has also completed a report on a 2016 fatal crash in Florida in which Autopilot was engaged.Tesla, which did not respond to requests for comment on December 13, and the NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous.Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. Last month, US Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep.The NHTSA has previously confirmed special crash investigations in a number of Tesla crashes, but the overall number of crashes under review has not been previously reported nor has the agency's investigation of the Connecticut crash.In the Connecticut incident, the Tesla struck a state police car waiting for a tow truck to provide assistance to a motorist and then struck a disabled vehicle. The Tesla driver said the vehicle was on Autopilot and he was checking on his dog in the back seat prior to the crash. The driver was issued a misdemeanour summons for reckless driving; no one involved was seriously injured.A Connecticut State Police spokeswoman on December 13 referred questions about whether Autopilot was engaged to Tesla."

title,"In-Depth | When onion made India cry: How onion price rise affects politics, business and the common man"
datetime,2019-12-13 16:39:00+00:00
description,Onion – an ordinary vegetable – is a crucial political commodity given its long-standing history of overturning governments in India.
content,"The price of onion has been hovering above Rs 100 per kilogram for over a month leaving the entire nation wailing. Skyrocketed prices of this key kitchen staple has not only left households teary-eyed but traders, wholesalers, and farmers have also been equally affected as people are beginning to cut back using the costly bulb.Scores of small restaurants are also feeling the pinch as rising prices of onion is taking a hit on their business. While some restaurants are opting to pass on the burden to customers, many others are mulling over reducing the usage of onion until the situation stabilises.The power of the bulb, which is an essential utility item for the rich as it is for the poor, can be seen in ways that it is tempting thieves, destroying livelihoods and putting a question mark on the policies of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government.Even as the Centre is taking steps to tackle the onion crisis, the Opposition is leaving no opportunity to target the government over the exponential spike in onion prices.The primary reason that the Centre should be jittery is because onion prices have had the potential to topple governments in the past.NoneThe sudden rise in the price of this ubiquitous kitchen item has been officially attributed to a decline in domestic production during kharif (harvested after October) and late-kharif (harvested in January- March) seasons because of late monsoon followed by excess rains in major producing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka.There is a shortfall in production by over 15.8 lakh tonnes this year, as per the data provided by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha. According to the minister, states had estimated production of onion to be over 69.9 lakh tonnes by November 30 in this season, but the actual production is likely to be 53.67 lakh tonnes.NoneThe heavy unseasonal rainfall which lashed Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat in September also contributed to the price rise as it damaged the ready crop in these states.What is the average rate of onion prevailing in the country?The price of this kitchen essential has been rising steadily in the country. It started to climb from September and has averaged over Rs 100 per kg since November 25.Since then, the price has hovered over the Rs 100 per kg mark in most states. The rates are as high as Rs 165/kg in Panaji (Goa).As per official data, onion prices are ruling at Rs 96 per kg in the national capital, Rs 102 per kg in Mumbai, Rs 100 in Chennai and Rs 140 per kg in Kolkata.Onion is being sold at Rs 160 per kg in Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Mayabunder, and at Rs 150 per kg in Tirupati, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Palakkad.In Bengaluru, Wayanad, Ramanathapuram and Port Blair, the rates stood at Rs 140 per kg.Onion prices prevailed at Rs 120 per kg in Gurugram, Jagdalpur, Behrampur, Purulia, Maldah, Itanagar, Agartala, Puducherry, Dindigul, Tirunelveli and Dharmapuri.In Amritsar, Surat, Jabalpur, Darbhanga, Sambalpur, Balasore and Gangtok, onion prices were Rs 110 per kg.Onion rates are Rs 100 per kg in Chandigarh, Shimla, Mandi, Srinagar, Jammu, Ludhiana, Gorakhpur, Haridwar, Ahmedabad, Patna, Cuttack, Jeypore, Kharagpur, Raiganj, Shillong and Tiruchirappalli.Why does the onion matter so much?Onion is a staple in kitchen and an essential ingredient in most cuisines. Therefore, an increase in the price of the bulb affects a large section of the society including farmers, traders, wholesalers and households.The price rise has also adversely affected the business of street-side food vendors and small restaurants.Bitan Mukherjee, co-owner of a retro-themed cafe in Kolkata told PTI that the skyrocketing prices of onions were affecting the profit margin in the restaurant, adding that he would be compelled to increase the rate of items if the situation does not stabilise.NoneThe importance of the vegetable is also being seen in unexpected ways; the rise in its price is tempting thievery. The police has registered cases for missing onions, launched probes, arrested people and recovered the bulb from them.In one such incident, cops arrested two persons for allegedly stealing 168 kgs of onion worth Rs 20,160 in south Mumbai. Yet they could recover only 68 kgs of onions from the duo.A case has also been registered against Union Minister of Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Pawan for ""misleading and cheating"" people on the rise in the price of onion. It was filed by a person named M Raju Nayyar in Muzaffarpur Civil Court who said that Paswan misled people through his statement that the price of the vegetable has gone up due to its black marketing.NoneNoneHow does onion affect politics?Onion – an ordinary vegetable – is a crucial political commodity given its long-standing history of overturning governments in India.1980: The onion electionThe political footprint of onion was established in the 1980 general elections when Indira Gandhi, who had suffered a defeat after she proclaimed Emergency from 1975 to 1977, rose back to power by making onion prices a populist rallying cry. Waving garlands of onions at political gatherings, she thrashed the ruling government for its failure to control prices.None1998: Onion repeats historyNoneThe onion again showed its influence on the country's politics in 1998, when it was regarded as the deciding factor in the Delhi and Rajasthan Assembly elections. In Delhi, the late Sushma Swaraj-led government faced the wrath of angry citizens as the BJP lost the state polls to Congress despite performing well in Lok Sabha elections, which had concluded months ago. Similarly, an onion crisis, which was set off by unseasonal rains, ended up  snatching power from the BJP government in Rajasthan.2010: A grave concernNoneIn 2010, the country witnessed a dramatic rise in the cost of onion across markets due to shortage of onion production because of erratic rainfall in the onion producing belts across the country. The crisis led to simmering political tensions in the country and was described as ""a grave concern"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.In response, Singh banned onion exports, lowered import taxes and got shipments of onions from neighbouring Pakistan, which ultimately lowered the price of the bulb in India.But why?!Now that it is evident that onion has impacted India's politics, let us understand why.Put simply, if the price of the essential commodity is shooting high, it is most likely to anger a large bloc of voters – be they everyday-households, farmers, wholesalers, or anyone engaging in selling or purchasing onion.Tn the present year too, the Opposition has gotten enough fodder in the rise in price of onion and is leaving no stone unturned to target the ruling dispensation; even as the PM Modi-led NDA government is trying to defuse the onion bomb before it explodes.NoneThe minister was targetted on her statement by former finance minister P Chidambaram. The Congress leader, who was recently given bail in the INX Media case,  said that if ""she doesn't eat onions, what does she eat? Does she eat Avocado?""NoneWhat could be a viable solution?Every time onion prices soar, the standard response of the government is the imposition of a minimum export price (MEP), and resorting to imports. In the current crisis as well, similar steps have been taken.But is that enough?Experts believe that such policies are only a temporary solution to evade the crisis. Besides, they deprive the farmers of whatever little benefits they get from onion exports. The country needs a robust long-term solution.According to observers, the annual see-sawing of onion prices is primarily due to hoarding and not because of supply constraints.NoneThe Ministry of Consumer Affairs has also directed the state governments to carry out immediate anti-hoarding operations to ensure that the supply in the markets are augmented and stock holding limits are strictly enforced.NoneWith this, the total quantity of imports that have been contracted so far reached approximately 30,000 tonnes, according to an official statement.However, the government needs to mull over long-term solutions to prevent the crisis in future. These include observing weather patterns early with the help of advanced technology and managing the crops accordingly.Better water management is a dire need to save the crop from damage in situations like drought and excessive rainfall.Provision of suitable, safe and cheap storage facilities to farmers can save the bulb from rotting, thus helping them sell their full crops at a reasonable price."

title,The Bharat Bond ETF is not without risks
datetime,2019-12-16 09:00:00+00:00
description,"Investors are going gaga over the Bharat Bond ETF, whose NFO has opened. But is it as attractive an instrument as it is made out to be?"
content,"Rajiv ShastriThe Bharat Bond ETFs are here and those in the investment ecosystem in India can’t stop talking about them. Asset managers, advisers and the media have all expressed their opinion, which is largely positive and salutary.The Bharat Bond ETF is, after all, a brand-new investment product; an option that investors didn’t have yet. It’s certainly different; but, does that make it necessarily better? Let’s take a deeper look.How it compares with other optionsThe Bharat Bond ETF offers a unique combination of relative return certainty (if held to maturity), beneficial tax treatment (if held for more than three years) and liquidity (if one needs to exit before maturity – as the ETFs will be listed on the exchanges).Returns from a bond instruments such as debt mutual funds, when held for at least three years, get taxed at a rate of 20 percent, with indexation benefits as well.Of the three benefits mentioned above, the first two (relative return certainty and beneficial tax treatment) are available on fixed maturity plans (FMPs) that have maturities of more than three years.The last two factors (tax and liquidity) are available in the growth options of open-ended debt funds, if held for more than 3 years.NoneWith this proposition and indicative yields that compare favourably with bank fixed deposits, there is a distinct possibility that the Bharat Bond ETFs will be successful in collecting a reasonably large amount of money. However, this success will come on the back of significant concerns.The risk factors The Bharat Bond ETFs (there is a 2023 maturity plan and a 2030 maturity plan) track the respective indices that contain bonds of 13 AAA-rated central public sector enterprises in the 2023 version and 12 in the 2030 version. Investments in the bonds of each of these companies can be done for up to a maximum of 15 per cent of the corpus.The rules governing the Bharat Bond Index specify that the index will be tweaked every quarter based on certain parameters. For instance, an issuer will be excluded from the indices if it is downgraded to a rating below “AAA,” or, if it ceases to be a CPSE.If a company is excluded from the index, the ETF will be obliged to sell its holding of instruments issued by that firm. And this is where the primary concern lies.Debt ETFs are commonplace in countries that have reasonably vibrant debt markets – those that exhibit a reasonable amount of inherent liquidity. This liquidity is largely absent in the Indian non- government debt market, especially in the longer-term segment in which the Bharat Bond ETFs will operate. In this largely illiquid market, bonds issued by CPSEs are thought to be relatively liquid. But this liquidity isn’t the same for all CPSE issuers and is quite fickle as well, especially when faced with unanticipated changes in either credit quality or the ownership of the issuers.There is a school of thought that believes the Government of India will ensure these issuers are not downgraded. But the ground realities are different.Case in pointLet’s take Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) as an example. Bonds issued by REC, which has a 12.72 per cent allocation in the 2030 plan and a 15 per cent allocation in the 2023 plan already trade at yields higher than those issued by say, the Power Finance Corporation (PFC), even though both are rated “AAA” and designated as Navratnas.An increase in yield means investors are now demanding higher interest rate to lend money to the company – it causes a drop in the price of the bond.Moreover, bonds issued by REC attract a narrower set of market participants than what PFC does, and are therefore subject to uncertain liquidity. And with good reason.The government holds 56.16 per cent in PFC. Till recently, the government held 52.63 per cent in REC.But in March 2019, PFC acquired the government’s entire stake in REC, making REC a subsidiary of PFC. And, even though REC technically continues to be designated as a CPSE, the effective step-down holding of the government in REC currently stands at less than 30 per cent. And this is causing some discomfort to bond-market participants, which manifests in the form of lower participation and higher yield.The liquidity problemAs things stand, bonds issued by REC continue to have some liquidity by virtue of the company’s rating and ownership. But it is extremely likely that this would vanish if either were to change. This holds true for most of the issuers in the Bharat Bond Indexes and ETFs. And while the indices will find it easy to exclude an issuer, the ETFs will find it most difficult to exit their positions.Since exclusions and exits will be predictable after a downgrade or divestment, and everyone will be aware of the ETFs’ exact holdings and their need to exit these positions, it is quite likely that such exits, even when available, will happen only at less-than-ideal prices if/when liquidity dries up. This is a cost that will be passed on to the ETF investors.Moreover, while one may have some element of certainty with respect to the ratings and ownership of these CPSEs over a three-year period, it would take an extremely courageous investor to forecast these out to ten years and risk money on the 2030 ETF.Given the liquidity realities of the Indian bond market, the Bharat bond ETF may just be an example of putting the cart before the horse. It is a product which promises to offer liquidity even when its underlying asset market does not.And while, it may achieve some success in raising funds, its potential and its ability to fulfil the assurances to investors will always be undermined by the fact that the bond markets need attention first."

It tells that while the market is stagnant or reducing, people are appreciating newer offerings,"" Porsche India Director Pavan Shetty told PTI when asked how the slowdown in Indian auto industry has impacted the company's sales.Citing the company's own case, he said since the third generation (E3) of Cayenne -- Porsche's flagship range in India -- was launched in October last year the company is delivering ""one car every two days"".""The Cayenne sells at a price point of Rs 1.18 crore. At that price point we have been selling one car every two days,"" Shetty claimed.The company had also launched its compact SUV Macan priced at Rs 69.98 lakh in July.When asked about the sales prospects of this year, he said,""With new cars coming in our portfolio is fresh.

This variant will of course be more expensive but it also attracts a few people who want an SUV.""Shetty said Cayenne is suited for the kind of infrastructure prevalent in India due to its higher ground clearance.The Cayenne Coupe, he said is more like a sports car with a higher ground clearance and with the aesthetics of a coupe.""It has an active spoiler which gets deployed at speeds beyond 70kmph and retracts when it comes at a lower speed.

description,The new Gordon Murray T.50 will be the company's first production car and its main feature will be a 400 mm fan sitting on the rear bumper.
content,"Aerodynamics forms an integral part of the structure of a supercar. Seeing how the car can potentially fly off the ground if things aren't done right, decades of research has been done in this field to reduce drag without compromising on traction.Now all this research has made cars faster and more stable, but British design firm -- Gordon Murray Automotive -- has brought us the future of aerodynamics. The new Gordon Murray T.50 will be the company's first production car and its main feature will be a 400 mm fan sitting on the rear bumper.The fan sits right between the aerofoils and the high mounted exhausts and looks more akin to a sci-fi jet thruster than what its real purpose is. As mentioned before, the fan's direct function will be to speed up the air passing from under the car and channel it through active elements in the car's rear diffuser. The air inlets at the bottom are also vertical so no debris is pushed into the fan's blades.The fan itself, which was first introduced in the Brabham BT46B Formula 1 car, is an active element that works alongside two active spoilers on either side allowing for six different aero modes. The default mode is 'auto' and, no surprises, here lets the car's brain control everything about the aerodynamics required depending on speed and driver input.NoneThen there is braking mode, which is not really selectable, but activates every time you step on the brakes. This causes the spoiler to activate, increasing downforce twice the normal as well as acting as air brakes.Then you have four driver selectable modes. There is 'high downforce mode' for track days and a 'streamline mode' for cruising on the highways. In streamline mode, drag is claimed to be reduced by 10 percent and the fan operates at its top speed creating a 'virtual longtail' at the rear.Then there is 'vmax mode' which, alongside all the aero trickery, bumps up the power by 30 hp by using the 48 volt start-generator. And finally, just so you can show off, you also get 'test mode', which activates all of the aero functions while standing still."

description,An FIR is the written confirmation of police records on the basis of which the investigation and the arrests take place.
content,"Malavika Rajkumar & Kadambari AgarwalAn FIR (First Information Report) is a document prepared by the police when they receive information about a crime or offence that has been committed. Typically, while filing an FIR, the police will ask multiple details regarding the complaint you have and give you a copy of the FIR to keep.An FIR is integral as it is the written confirmation of police records on the basis of which the investigation and the arrests take place.Where do you file the FIR?You can file the FIR by going to the nearest police station. In 2013, the concept of “Zero FIR” was introduced in India whereby it is not a requirement for you to go to the police station in the area where the crime or incident took place. You can go to any police station to report the incident and they have to mandatorily record this and transfer it to the police station in the area/jurisdiction where the incident/crime took place. To find the nearest police station, you can download the ‘Indian Police at your call’ application. You can also file an FIR online. For example in Delhi, you can file an online FIR if you have lost your sim card or your phone has been snatched, etc.Who can file an FIR?You can file an FIR if you are the victim of a crime, if you know that a crime has taken place or is about to take place. If you cannot file it, anyone, including your relatives, friends, etc. can file the FIR on your behalf. It is not necessary that you must have all the information about the crime in order to file an FIR. However, it is important that you report everything you know to the police.Filing the FIRRemember that the details written down in the FIR cannot be changed. You, or someone on your behalf can only give additional information about the incident/crime, if you have any.Filing an FIR may be a daunting process for many. Sometimes, the police may refuse to file your complaint without giving any reason. This is why it is important for you to understand the importance of filing an FIR and knowing what your rights are so that you can insist on getting your FIR registered."

Tewoo’s default signals that corporate stress has aggravated further and the Chinese government is finding it difficult to contain credit risk in a weakening economy.Company backgroundBased out of Tianjin, Tewoo is a material circulation company. It is a bulk trader of commodities such as metals (ferrous & nonferrous), energy, minerals and chemicals. Besides commodity trading, the company has presence in other areas such as infrastructure, logistics, real estate, autos and financial services.In 2017, it had a turnover of $66.6 billion with profits of $122 million and was ranked 129th in the Fortune Global 500 list & 28th in the Chinese enterprises list. The company employs more than 19,000 professionals and has operations across the US, Germany, Japan and Singapore.Funding crunch linked to business associateTewoo’s financial challenges are closely linked to Bohai Steel Group, a business associate which has filed for liquidation due to high leverage. Bohai’s bankruptcy in 2018 triggered systemic risk in Tianjin’s financial market and Tewoo has been facing serious liquidity challenges in recent months.  The group’s financial difficulties came to the fore in April when it approached lenders for a debt recast and sold copper at below market rates market to ease the cash crunch. Consequently, Fitch Ratings downgraded the company by six notches in one go.In the last week of November, Tewoo had proposed its lenders take a huge haircut on the bonds or accept delayed repayment at reduced coupon rates. The 14-day deadline for accepting the proposal expired earlier this week and only 57 percent of the investors had accepted proposal. Less than 100 percent acceptance is termed as a failure and this means that the company will miss interest payments due 16 December on $1.25 billion worth of bonds.Banks suffer as NPAs rise Tewoo’s liabilities are pegged around $36 billion including $2 billion of foreign debt. While the amount is small compared to China’s overall economy, the quantum of bad debt is mounting. Last week, another Chinese state-owned conglomerate Peking University Founder Group skipped payments on $284 million bonds. In total, Chinese corporate borrowers have defaulted on nearly $20 billion this year. The pace of defaults has picked up in recent weeks and fears of contagion are rising as around 15 defaults have been reported since the start of November. The list covers a broad spectrum of industries from real estate to metal to manufacturing and automobiles. The liquidity crunch, which was earlier restricted to private companies, has now spilled over to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and even universities. In fact, the non-performing asset ratio for private Chinese companies has surged to an all-time-high of 4.5 percent in 2019.The stress on corporate debt has resulted in three regional bank failures in recent months. The collapse of Baoshang Bank in May 2019, a small regional bank with $90 billion in assets, was the first bank failure in over 20 years. A couple of months later Bank of Jinzhou was bailed out by three state-controlled asset managers. Last month, Hengfeng Bank joined the list raising concerns over the financial stability of the entire banking system in China.NoneGlobal slowdown hurting businessesInvestments in state-backed or state-owned companies are considered safe-havens as these are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. So, Tewoo’s case can be termed as a sovereign default and failure to repay foreign investors’ money can have major repercussions on the influx of fresh capital into the Chinese economy. Emerging markets such as China are dependent on foreign investors for their funding requirements and capital outflows can result in currency depreciation and further weaken the financial system. The situation is similar to the IL&FS default in the domestic market – which triggered the liquidity crisis in India and resulted in an intense slowdown in the country’s growth rate.China’s situation remains tricky. The trade war with the US is hurting businesses and macro-economic conditions are deteriorating across the globe. Corporates across the world are facing an uphill task of maintaining their profitability and managing their interest payments. As per S&P Global, foreign denominated debt maturities for Chinese companies stands at $90 billion and $100 billion in 2020 and 2021 respectively. In addition, these companies need to repay around $700 billion in local debt each year – for 2020 and 2021.  Investors should remain risk-averse and keep a close watch on such major developments in bond and credit markets – which influence both the flows and returns of equity markets.Follow @Sach_PalNone"

description,"Timing the market is almost impossible but the right mix in the portfolio, in keeping with the risk appetite, can ensure good returns."
content,"NoneArun Kumar“Don't try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. It can't be done except by liars,” said Bernard Baruch.Attempts at timing the market can make investors worse off in the long run than riding out the inherent volatility. This is simply because it’s hard to precisely forecast how the market will move.Here is some data to show how market timing is highly unlikely to work.Our analysis of stock market data shows that a significant chunk of investor gains over a long period of time is actually the result of only a handful of highest-return days or as we call them, the best days.Miss a few of these and your long-term investment returns can take a big hit. Conversely, if you stay out of the market on a few lowest-return, or worst days, it can bump up your returns substantially.But, these good and bad days are very hard to guess in advance. With these days (five best and five worst) accounting for just 0.14 percent of the 7,120 trading days over a 30-year period, it’s very easy to miss them in your effort to time your entries and exits to and from the market.All it takes is a few daysWe looked at the Nifty daily returns from the start-- July 1990 till November 2019. Assuming that someone invested Rs 10 lakh in the market at the start of this period (30 years approximately) and stayed put all through, then they would end up with Rs 4.3 crore today."

content,"None“The market in which FSC (Future Supply Chain) operates is currently about Rs 22,000 crores and is expected to grow at 15 to 20 percent CAGR over the next five years,” Toshniwal said.Currently, the Indian logistics industry is worth $180 billion and contributes roughly 14 percent to India’s GDP.Future Supply Chain, incorporated on March 8, 2006, is a third-party logistics service operator in India. The company covers the entire gamut of the supply chain across the logistics value chain including smart warehousing, transportation, and distribution system and temperature-controlled logistics.As of September 30, 2019, FSC operates through 90 distribution centres across India, covering around 8.33 million sq. ft. of warehouse space.Its hub-and-spoke distribution model comprises 13 hubs and 132 branches across India.A hub and spoke network is a centralised, integrated logistics system designed to keep costs down. Hub and spoke distribution centres receive products from many different origins, consolidate the products, and send them directly to destinations.Toshniwal believes the logistics industry is an ‘extremely inefficient industry’ from the standpoint of the global standard; however, going forward technology will play a pivotal role in the company’s growth.“We believe technology will be a very important differentiator for operations to provide efficiencies for our customers,” Toshniwal said.Future Supply Chain will continue to focus on serving consumption-driven sectors like fashion, footwear, food, FMCG, electronics, and furniture.On December 11, FSC said it has got required approvals to sell 22 percent stake to Japanese logistic firm Nippon Express for Rs 641 crore.According to the transaction, the Future Group's logistics arm will issue 3.78 million shares to Nippon Express at a price of Rs 664 per share, Toshniwal said.""Through this primary issue Nippon Express will hold 8.6 percent stake on a fully diluted basis and FSC will raise around Rs 252 crore for funding its near-term growth plans,"" the company had said in a regulatory filing.The 252 crore proceeds will be utilized for the expansion of warehousing capacities.In terms of setting up distribution centres, Toshniwal said the company has set up six distribution centres, and another four-five distribution centres will be set up in FY21.Nippon Express established in 1937 is a global logistics company that provides land-sea-air service across 711 bases in 308 cities in 48 countries. It is expanding the storage and transport of goods worldwide. The consolidated annual sales are about $20 billion.The warehouse operates around 10 million square meters, with approximately 3,050,000 square meters overseas."

datetime,2019-12-14 08:38:00+00:00
description,"While employees are entitled to take a set number of leaves each year, atleast 5-10 percent of this remains underutilised. "
content,"As the year comes to a close, corporate offices start seeing empty seats. This is because employees start taking holidays more frequently in December to exhaust their entitled leaves.This not only impacts productivity but in service sector roles leads to the end user also facing service delays. A simpler way of preventing this would be to offer partial leave encashment at the end of every three to five years.Leave encashment is a policy which a majority of corporates offer as an added benefit. So if an individual accumulates 60-90 days, this can be encashed at the time of retirement or separation.Companies typically do not allow more than 30-40 days’ leave to be accumulated. This is to ensure that at the time of retirement of senior management, they do not have to end up a heavy benefit.At the time of his retirement in 2017, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman AM Naik was entitled to Rs 38.04 crore retirement benefit, of which Rs 32.2 crore was the leave encashment. This is because Naik rarely took any leaves during his career spanning 50 plus years at L&T.A few companies buy leave encashment policies for individual employees. This can be redeemed at the time of retirement or separation and covers the employer’s liability for encashment. However, this may not be cost effective of companies with a large employee size.Even in companies where employees are entitled to take upto 30-40 paid leaves a year, the staff is rarely allowed to exhaust this limit. A rough estimate suggests that 5-10 percent of the leaves go unused.A simpler way would be to pay atleast 30-40 percent of the amount for the unused leaves proportional to the monthly compensation of the particular individual. As the employee moves higher up in the hierarchy, the proportion of cash payment for unused leaves could be increased.If any corporate employee takes a day off without applying for it, it is a common practice to deduct this day’s pay from his/her salary. The same should apply to leaves that they are legally entitled to."

title,Variable pay to eat up 50-55% of India Inc salaries from 2020
datetime,2019-12-13 20:26:00+00:00
description,A rise in variable pay directly means that the yearly in-hand compensation could be much lower.
content,"A new-age payments technology firm has been exploring the option of tweaking the compensation structure of its senior management to raise the variable pay to 50 percent of the cost-to-company (CTC) from the current 40 percent. The idea is to cap fixed costs and increasingly link the pay to performance.As companies grapple with cost pressures, linking variable pay or the performance-based component of the compensation package of senior management to the company's performance is becoming an alternative.This could mean the variable pay will be raised to 50-55 percent of the CTC in 2020. At present, it constitutes 40-45 percent of the CTC for top management while it is between 25-30 percent for the junior staff.With a drop in corporate earnings in the September quarter, there is increasing pressure on companies to link a large quantum of the pay to performance. Employee cost that is almost 30-35 percent of the expenses weighs down the earnings.“The variable component of the CTC also takes into account how a company performs and not just an individual employee’s performance. Hence, it makes sense to have a larger quantum of variable pay,” said the chief human resource officer at a large financial services firm.A rise in variable pay directly means that the yearly in-hand compensation could be much lower. This is because even if an employee completes all targets and the company performs well, only 80-85 percent of the variable pay will be given.For instance, if an individual has an annual CTC of Rs 10 lakh, of which Rs 4 lakh is in variable pay, then the take-home compensation will be Rs 6 lakh excluding taxes. However, an increase in the percentage of variable could mean Rs 4 lakh will now be Rs 5 lakh and reduce the take-home to Rs 5 lakh. It is also important to note that variable compensation is usually paid as a bulk amount and will attract taxes.""Instead of hiking the annual salary substantially, firms will only increase a large chunk of the variable portion in 2020. So while on paper an employee's CTC goes up, the actual salary may stay constant,"" said the India chief executive of a global HR firm.On the one hand, corporate earnings have slowed, while on the other there is a consumption slowdown. For consumer-facing industries like FMCG, retail and e-commerce, this leads to further concern. Hence, the variable pay to match this change.India’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.5 percent in July-September 2019, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2012-13, confirming fears of a deepening slowdown in the economy as households aren't spending enough to buoy demand and companies aren't adding capacities or hiring more.HR sources said the top management will be the biggest hit while there will be a partial increase for the entry-level staff as well.Which sectors would be impacted?Among sectors, BFSI, FMCG/retail and e-commerce would be the biggest hit. In e-commerce, for instance, the variable pay that stood at around 30 percent three to four years ago has now increased to almost 40-45 percent for the top management.In banking, Reserve Bank of India has said that top executives will have to receive half of their salary in variables which will be linked to the bank's performance. This comes into effect from April 1, 2020.This will help save banks on the salary costs with entities struggling with rising bad loans and a slump in real estate sector impacting loan disbursals."

title,Nooruddin Fidai | Creating magic out of moving averages

description,"Moving average based trading is one of the simplest form of trend trading but has been lost in the maze of new indicators. Nooruddin Fidai, one of the respected names in moving average based trading demystifies his art. "
content,"Shishir AsthanaLeonardo Da Vinci’s words, ‘Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication’ rings as true for trading as it does for other fields.However, many technical analysts and traders in the market complicate their recommendations or strategies by using multiple indicators and jargons to impress fellow traders and novices.Moving averages are the simplest overlays on a price chart, and give a clear picture of the price movement. Yet it is often ignored by technical analysts and ‘experts’ because of the number of loss-making trade it generates.NoneWhen Fidai rose to speak at the Investors Carnival in Goa after a sumptuous dinner few were in the mood to listen to a speech on moving averages. But, once he took the stage, all were mesmerised by the technique's simplicity and magic.From selling shoes on the street of Mumbai to trading, addressing trader’s conferences and training and mentoring other traders, Fidai has come a long way. He is also a hotelier and an ex-banker.In this interview with Moneycontrol, Fidai demystifies moving averages and talks of his journey as a trader.Edited excerptsQ: How did your market journey begin?A: I was introduced to the markets soon after I started my job as a banker in 1990. Those were the days when the market was picking up and I was at the right place at the right time. This was one of the few positive coincidences I had seen in my life thus far.I was born in Hyderabad and moved to Mumbai when I was 9. I am the youngest of eight siblings and we all moved to Mumbai since our father worked here. Life in Mumbai was tough as we did not have a proper house to live in. We changed seven homes in six years, including living in the factory godown where my father worked.Even now when I am asked what I have achieved as a trader, my spontaneous response is that I now have my home in Mumbai. The importance of having a roof over your head that you can call your own is occasionally appreciated.Despite the hardship, our father ensured that each of us was given the best possible education. I completed my tenth with good marks and selected the commerce stream for further education. By this time the family needed all working hands onboard. I had taken admission in Bhavans College, Andheri but to help my family I used to sell ladies footwear on the streets of Versova.After completing my 12th I managed to get a job at a chartered accountant’s firm as an audit assistant. One of the audits I did was with DCB Bank and as luck would have it, I was working in the bank the next year.The second-year into my degree college the bank announced they had vacancies and one would need to clear an entrance exam to get selected. I was in no mood to apply for the job but a relative challenged me that I will not be able to clear it. I not only cleared it, but I also topped the exam. Providence played its part again, the girl who stood second in the banking exam would become my life partner in the next few years.While at the job I saw many of my colleagues apply for initial public offerings (IPOs) and I was pulled into the craze as well. I started to learn about these IPOs and the ones that did well in the market.My friend and I started a pool by collecting money from colleagues. In the 1990s, we collected Rs 200 per month per person. Those who could afford it contributed more to the kitty. We also borrowed Rs 40,000 at 18 percent interest to make the fund sizeable.The idea of this pool was to invest and trade in IPOs. The fund had a three-year lock-in. We accumulated Rs 1.2 lakh by the end of 1991 which shot up to Rs 10 lakh by 1992-end.When the market tanked after the Harshad Mehta scam our kitty also shrunk. At the end of three years, the fund had generated 60 percent after deducting our fees of 10 percent and the interest payout of 18 percent.Though it was a profitable and pleasant experience, the incident did not get me hooked in the markets. I kept on investing and building up my portfolio slowly while at the same time continuing as a banker.I worked with DCB Bank for around 13 years from 1990-2003 but moved to the middle-east on a good offer. However, I did not get along with my boss and quit the job in 15 months and decided to trade full-time. Q: How was your trading journey?A: I began trading full-time after I returned from the middle-east. I had some savings from my trip abroad and a small portfolio but I did not know anything about trading.I bought a computer in mid-April 2004 and borrowed a friend's CD which had the technical analysis software of Metastock, which I downloaded and we can start making money. I had no idea what technical analysis is or how the software worked.Then on May 17, 2004, the market fell 16 percent in a single day (Pokhran Nuclear test by India) and a major chunk of my portfolio went down with it. I had the intention to trade but my capital eroded even before I could start. My friend who was supposed to help me with the trading software also got busy with his job.Pushed to the wall I decided to start learning the ropes myself. Thankfully my wife was working, so the pressure of running the house was not there.I read up on the rudimentary tutorial of Metastock for each indicator and started using it in the market. In those days there was no online reading material to educate oneself. My trial and error cost me money and my portfolio came down from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50,000 in six months. Worst still I was nowhere close to breaking the code of making money in the markets.But slowly the code revealed itself, it was all along in front of me. Whenever I opened my Metastock Software the first chart that I saw had five lines that were displayed along with price and volume. I had found my moving average or MA. It was there as a template in front of me. Though I never used to study the MA the picture was registered in front of me every day.Whenever the MAs converged and crossed there was usually a very strong move in direction of the lines. The convergence of the five MAs would give a long trade.Using the MA I was able to rebuild my portfolio from Rs 50,000 to Rs 5 lakh in a year without taking any leverage. Markets in those days were supportive and stocks were flaring up in front of me.Looking back I took a lot of risks. Though there was no leverage trading and I invested the entire money in a single trade. After earning around 30 percent in the trade the position was shifted to another stock where the moving averages were converging and crossing over.NoneThose were the days when data from the market would come late in the night at around 9 p.m. From 9 pm to 3 am I would sit and study charts to scan the markets. At times there was no data on account of some glitch and I had to manually feed the data in which would take hours. But it was those gruelling hours that finally paid off.While my trading journey picked up smoothly, my journey as a trainer just saw a moving average crossover.It all happened when we were trading and a kid who stayed in our building came in to collect the cable subscription amount. He used to see footwear outside the door every day. One day he came in and asked what we do. I told him we study the markets and trade in it. He showed interest to learn about it and asked if I was willing to teach him for a fee.I had no idea if there was something like professional training in technical analysis and told him it would take Rs 5,000 to discourage him. In those days it was a substantial amount for informal training. To my surprise, the kid – Sohail knocked on the door the next day with the fee. I started working with him and sat for a couple of hours after the market closed. Sohail picked up fast, started trading and making money. As a result, his lifestyle changed. Looking at him others wanted to learn and started coming to learn.This was the time we started Analyse India. During this period we started putting our recommendation on the Moneycontrol message board. In those days there were very few of us who were giving recommendations, as a result, we acquired good followership. We were contacted by broking houses for seminars and training sessions across the country. During that period I travelled across the country giving seminars and on training sessions.In April 2006 I opened a sub-broking office as a diversification from my trading. The business did well till 2013 when the market volume collapsed. Brokers started cannibalising their sub-broker clients and I decided to exit from the broking business. I also gave the reigns of Analyse India to Nooresh who was a partner and withdrew all my money from the market.I decided to take a sabbatical from the market and entered the hotel business with a friend. Between 2014 and 2017 I travelled to the hotel every day which was on the Mumbai-Nasik road. The daily travel took a toll on my health and I developed an ailment which prevented travel. I then became a sleeping partner in the trading business.Though I now had time in my hand I was not in the best of health to trade as aggressively as I used to or travel to various locations to train for long hours at a go. Nooresh then suggested that I need not travel to train, I can do it as effectively by training online. That was the beginning of my second innings in the market. I also started trading, but only on the longer timeframe.It was in one such training session when a student from Kolkata approached me and asked if I can be his mentor. The mentorship program took off which is not only about teaching the strategy to trade but also about position sizing, money management, the psychology behind successful trading and hand-holding through the initial trades. Q: How do you trade using moving averages?A: My trading involves exponential moving averages. I use five moving averages – 4/9/18/50 and 200-day exponential moving averages (DEMA). The reason I select four days is that it is one day less than a working week, 9 day is one day less than two working weeks, 18 days is around two days less than a working month and 50 and 200 days moving averages are empirical and widely followed.I trade the moving average crossovers. However, I do not trade every crossover of the five moving averages, there are certain conditions or filters that need to be satisfied before I enter the trade. I look at volumes – convergence on good volumes generally result in a profitable trade.NoneThe size of the candle also matters at the point of convergence. A big candle is an indication that the market can move in the direction of the convergence. The same strategy can be used on a smaller intraday time frame or a longer timeframe.Further, there are three possible combinations of moving averages that can be used, depending on the trader's risk profile. The convergence of 3 moving averages or 4 or 5 can be taken. Thus one can use either the 4-9-18 or the 4-9-18-50 or 4-9-18-50-200 moving average crossovers. The important point to note is that the moving averages should in chronological order.Further, the four period moving average is important as it is the shadow of the market and follows prices very closely. During a vertical move in either direction, the four periods can offer an important support or resistance point to book full or partial profit. In case the move is slower the 9 periods moving average will be the cushion and for a sluggish move, the 18-period moving average can be used. Based on the momentum one can use the moving averages to act as support and resistance point.NoneAvoiding certain crossovers are also important to succeed in this form of trading. Smaller bodied candles at the point of convergence or a signal when the market is moving in a small range will give whipsaws.One can also use the convergence in the underlying stock to trade in the options market. If a buy signal is generated at the convergence a slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) call option can be bought.Apart from moving averages, I use support and resistance based trades.There are only two points where you can buy or sell using this strategy. You can either buy at support which offers the lowest risk or you can buy at the breakout of the resistance, where the risk is high but you have momentum in your favour. Similarly, one can sell near the resistance where the risk is lowest or a breakdown from the support where the risk is high but momentum favours the short seller.The good part about this form of trading is that one can use options very effectively. A long straddle – a buying at-the-money (ATM) calls and puts option at the support and resistance can offer a good trading opportunity. When the market tilts its hand and moves in one direction we can square off the other leg.If the market is at the support level and we buy a call and put and then the market falls we can square-off the call option and hold on to the put. Now support can be in various forms – it can be a trendline, a moving average, previous high or low or a big candle.There are certain support levels which are very hard to break like the 200 DEMA. Rather than taking a long straddle one can simply buy a call option when the market reaches this point. A small bounce around the 200 DEMA is enough to book a decent profit. If this support breaks the fall can be big and one can capitalize by buying puts. Q: You were amongst the earliest trainers in the market, what do you think a candidate should look for in a trainer?A: One of the first things I get asked is how many of your trades are right or what is your success rate. Frankly, that is a wrong question to ask. Success is a combination of your wining ratio and your risk-reward. A strategy can win only 30 or 40 percent of the time but if it has a risk-reward of 1:4 or 1:5 and above then the number of times your calls are right does not matter.Selection of a trainer just by looking at how many trades are profitable is the wrong approach. One should select a trainer or a training course depending on their requirements.If one cannot leave a job and wants to trade on the side he can pick up a trainer who teaches end-of-the-day (EOD) strategies or longer timeframe strategies. Similarly, someone who has retired or is waiting for a job and has time to sit in front of the terminal can look for a trainer who teaches more aggressive strategies. A good trainer will shorten the learning curve and prevent one from making the mistakes that he did."

title,India's largest security firm SIS' unique growth plan is out-of-the-box
datetime,2019-12-13 16:14:00+00:00
description,"Along with security solutions, SIS is gunning for pole positions in facilities management and cash management businesses too. None, globally, has done this"
content,"NoneThe second-generation entrepreneur is now rolling up his sleeves to achieve something equally remarkable. By 2025, Sinha wants SIS to also become the industry leader in facilities management and cash management.""And in each of the three segments - security solutions, facilities management and cash management - we want to have a market share of up to 15 percent,"" says Sinha of his next Five-Year Plan for SIS.That will be unique for any global security firm. In none of the big markets across the world, including US, UK and Australia, does the market leader in security business also enjoy leadership in segments of facilities management and cash management.For instance, if Allied Universal is the largest provider of security solutions in the US, the market leaders in facilities management and cash management are separate companies. Similar is the situation in the UK.SIS, which had revenue of Rs 7,093 crore in the 2019 financial year, generates more than half of its consolidated topline from the security solutions business. Facilities management and cash management segments make up for the rest. The company had revenues of over Rs 4,000 crore in the first six months of the present financial year, showing a growth of 24 percent, from a year earlier.The new target may be unique but Sinha believes it is achievable. ""It is not like a telecom company is diversifying into real estate sector. All SIS units are service-oriented companies, and sometimes share the same location. For instance, a hotel or a bank will use all our services,"" says Sinha.None The challengeIn security solutions business, which make up most for SIS's 2.25 lakh employees spread over 312 branches, the company has been comfortably sitting on the pole position.But it will be in the facilities management and cash business that the challenge lies. That is especially because, Sinha was hoping to become the largest player in these segments by 2019. Now the target has been pushed a little further.In facilities management segment, in which SIS acquired the then fourth largest Dusters in 2017, Sinha is gunning for the top market share in the next financial year. ""We have a monthly revenue of Rs 110 crore. We are number two in the industry right now,"" he says.An addition of Rs 15 crore in the monthly run rate will take the company into the pole position.It is the cash management vertical that could be the toughest. Even though SIS is the second largest player in the segment, it still has some catching up to do with leader CMS. The path has been tough, especially after demonetisation, and the resultant focus on digitisation, dented the cash management business.Sinha will have to bank on inorganic growth to pull it off. Industry sources pointed out that at least three companies in the top 10 are on the block, and whoever takes the lead in acquiring these would cement the top ranking in the industry.CMS is owned by private equity major Baring PE Asia.The three-point strategyWith his eyes on the 2025-vision, Sinha is using three tools to ensure that SIS is ready to handle the scale.""SIS has taken a micro market approach. We have gone hyper local,"" he says of the company that now has presence in 640 districts in India. No one city contributes to more than 5 percent of its topline.""Mumbai is a big market. But there is opportunity in a Solapur, Silvassa or Aurangabad. Our growth is not dependent on the metros or tier-1 cities,"" says Sinha.Second, he is investing in technology, both to build systems and processes in SIS, and for client servicing. For instance, a pilot project for Indian Railways uses sensors to inform when a toilet in a station has reached a certain limit in footfalls, and needs to be cleaned.Similarly, SIS now spends on an average less than 30 minutes in each hire. ""We have made our business processes repeatable and scalable. It's the philosophy that is followed by a quick service restaurant chain, like the McDonald's,"" says Sinha.It's important for a company that hires more than 30,000 people in its workforce in a year. That is same or higher than a top deck IT company.Sinha's third tool is people. ""As a market leader, we have unfortunately also become a favourite poaching ground,"" he explains. To prevent that, SIS now gives ESOPs to employees every four to five years, puts them up for higher education and has extensive training programmes.""If you take the top 500 key people of SIS,  their average years of service is 11 years. But their average age is only 39 years. So for 60 percent of them, SIS is their first job. My challenge is to ensure these people stay committed to SIS in the next 10 years,"" says Sinha."

datetime,2019-12-12 19:24:00+00:00
description,Premiums paid/reimbursed by the employer are tax-free perquisites for the employee
content,"NoneIn the past few years, expenditure incurred on healthcare has been on the rise, encompassing expenses on preventive check-ups, medical insurance, etc. Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) provides certain tax deductions for an individual in respect of such expenditure incurred on self or dependents, which have been discussed in this article.Mediclaim/Health insurance premiumFor individuals, deduction is allowed for premium paid under a medical insurance policy covering his/her own health or his/her family’s (i.e., spouse and dependent children) up to Rs 25,000 per annum. Further, an individual can claim a deduction for the premium paid under a medical insurance policy covering his/her parent or parents up to Rs 25,000 per annum. In case the said individual, spouse or parents are resident senior citizens (i.e., of the age 60 years or more), then the aforesaid deduction limit is enhanced to Rs 50,000 per annum. Expenditure incurred on preventive health check-up of up to Rs 5,000 per annum for self and family and/or parents, respectively can also be claimed as a deduction. This deduction is irrespective of the individual’s age and within the overall limits mentioned above.In the case of a salaried individual, it is possible that medical insurance coverage is provided by the employer (either by way of direct payment under a medical insurance policy with the insurance company for the employee or reimbursement of such premium to the employee for the coverage of the employee and his/her family).  Such premiums paid/reimbursed by the employer are tax-free perquisites for the employee. The employee may also opt for a higher coverage, upon being given a choice by the employer, by paying a top-up premium at his/her own expense. Such premium would be eligible for a deduction under Section 80D of the Act.  The employer can consider such a deduction while deducting tax at source (TDS) on taxable salary.All of the above deductions referred in the above two paragraphs can be allowed by the employer at the time of computing TDS on taxable income if the employee furnishes the requisite receipts/documents.  Alternatively, the employee can claim the same at the time of filing income-tax return for that particular Financial Year (FY).Medical expenditure A resident senior citizen, who is not covered under any mediclaim insurance scheme, can claim a deduction for actual medical expenditure incurred during a particular FY. Deduction can be claimed up to Rs 50,000 for the expenditure incurred on own or family’s health and an additional Rs 50,000 on parents’ health. No documents have been prescribed under the Act to be maintained for claiming this deduction; however, it would be prudent to maintain a record of prescription, along with copy of diagnostic tests, medicine bills, invoice copy for treatment etc. It is pertinent to note that this deduction can only be availed when no amount is being paid towards the health insurance of such individual.Mode of payment for the purpose of eligible deduction under this Section should be other than cash, except for expenses incurred towards preventive health check-ups for self and family and/or parents.Deduction limits under different scenarios are summarised as under:NoneTreatment for disability/severe disabilityBesides the above, a deduction of Rs 75,000 per annum is allowed to a resident individual under Section 80U of the Act who is suffering from specified disability as certified by a specified medical authority. In case such an individual suffers from any specified severe disability, the deduction limit is enhanced to Rs 1,25,000.For a resident individual, who has incurred an expenditure in respect of maintenance, including medical treatment of a dependent who is suffering from a specified disability or specified severe disability, a deduction is allowed under Section 80DD of the Act of Rs 75,000 and Rs 1,25,000, respectively.  This deduction is allowed provided no deduction has been claimed under Section 80U of the Act as mentioned above.Deduction for prescribed diseases and ailmentsExpenditure incurred by a resident individual on medical treatment of certain prescribed diseases or ailments (such as neurological diseases and malignant cancers) of self or dependents are eligible to claim deduction up to Rs 40,000 under Section 80DDB of the Act. However, in case the dependent is a senior citizen, the amount of deduction is available up to Rs 1,00,000.Dependents for the purpose of the aforesaid deductions (i.e. Section 80DD and 80DDB of the Act) include spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters, who are wholly or mainly dependent on such individual for support and maintenance. The individual claiming such deductions shall obtain a copy of the certificate issued by the prescribed medical authority in the specified form and manner, in respect of the relevant FY.With ever-rising cost of medical treatment, it is worthwhile for individuals to be aware of the potential tax deduction for the medical insurance/expenditure that they are incurring."

title,Dear couples: Discuss money matters to avoid post-marriage financial mishaps

description,Disclosing all the assets and liabilities prior to the wedding keeps the surprises away
content,"It took a while for Delhi-based Kirti Goel, 28, who is self-employed and financially independent, to realise that she now needs to manage her finances jointly with someone. That is, with her husband, Sishir Goel, 29. The couple had got married in 2017.“I didn’t know up until then if Sishir was risk-averse or likes taking risks in his investments, how he spends, and so on,” says Kirti. Just two months into their marriage, and Sishir realised that they needed to talk.NoneKalpesh Ashar, founder, Full Circle Financial Planners and Advisors is of the opinion that such conversations should be started when the couple starts courting and is serious about planning a life together.Shilpa Wagh, Chief Financial Coach at Wagh Financials says, “Have a financial plan either before wedding or immediately after settling down post the wedding.” Financial planners too are busy sensitising youngsters these days as the big-fat Indian wedding season gets underway.Build a contingency fundAs with an individual’s financial plan, it’s crucial for a newly-married couple to have an emergency corpus. Make sure you and your spouse have one. A contingency fund is the foundation of any financial plan because it is a corpus for emergencies such as a job loss. Its presence in your financial plan ensures that you do not withdraw from your long-term investments and allow them to grow instead. Such funds should be parked in fixed/low-risk instruments such as bank fixed deposits and liquid funds, so that you can access the same as and when required.Delhi-based Kumud Ratra, 26 who plans to marry her fiancée Kashish Malhotra, 28, is fortunate to have got a small push heading into her marriage. Instead of a grand reception, they have decided to hold a small ceremony, with only their immediate family members being invited, and save cost. “We’re saving approximately Rs 10 lakh and will now use part of the saving to build an emergency corpus and some near-term goals. We’ll put it in a fixed deposit,” says Kumud. Kumud Ratra and Kashish MalhotraKalpesh of Full Circle Financial Planners advises his young clients to share details of their earnings with one another, discuss spending habits, existing liabilities and if they wish to study further in future. The latter, he adds, can dent their regular monthly income, for which the couple should plan well in advance.Even though the money goals of a couple should be in unison, it’s vital that married women work towards financial independence, simultaneously.Discuss joint goalsIt’s important that the financial goals of a couple are in sync. But it’s okay to have individual ambitions of how they want to spend their money; but common goals also need to be executed jointly. For instance, the Goels want to launch a start-up, sometime in the future, for which the couple is working together on the financial aspects.Tanvi Goyal, Financial planner and Founder of financial advisory firm Wealth Aware says, “Now-a-days, couples want to keep some of the goals separate from joint goals; these include expanding a business or initiating a start-up; brides also want to build a corpus for their parents’ medical emergencies, etc.” You must plan for such needs by precisely understanding the time-frame of goals and corpus required.Honesty is important, says Kalpesh. “Many husbands don’t feel like disclosing their real income due to various reasons and they sometimes try to dissuade the wife from spending more, or sometimes just to inflate their own ego. Some husbands also take financial decisions without consulting their wives. They think their partners won’t understand financial products. This is a fallacy,” he says.Mrin Agarwal, financial educator and founder of Finsafe India says, “Disclosing all the assets and liabilities prior to the wedding keeps the surprises away. Also, this aids in preparing an asset allocation strategy for investments according to set goals immediately after the wedding.”Don’t let liabilities burden marriageIt’s not just that the assets that ought to be synchronised in a marriage. Loans and liabilities can bring a lot of stress. Financial planners suggest that if one of the spouses is serving a loan, disclosing it upfront before the wedding would be ideal. Before heading into the marriage, try and pay off education, vehicle and personal loans. Focus on clearing your outstanding personal loans or credit card debt before marriage since interest rates are high. Beginning married life without the burden of debt would be ideal for couples.After marriage, make sure you don’t give loans to friends and family. You might think it’s innocuous, but such behaviour if left unchecked, can create rifts.Purchase adequate insurance coverIn the hustle and bustle of life, Sishir Goel procrastinated reviewing his existing life insurance policy after he got married in December 2017. This is a common problem with many couples. When the Goels consulted a financial advisor in December 2018, they got to know that the adequate life cover needed was Rs 2 crore and Sishir only had few traditional life insurance policies with life cover of Rs 25 lakh. So, Goel immediately bought a term plan with adequate life cover.Both the husband and wife must buy pure term covers. These cover the financial loss caused due to a partner’s untimely demise. Next, buy a health insurance policy for the family. The thumb rule is to start early and healthy; insurance companies will be more than happy to offer policies to couples.Moneycontrol’s take"

Currently, it takes around six to 12 months to secure approval for a clinical trial.Tellmann said the GDD in Hyderabad helped in the launch life-saving medicines to market including breakthrough products like the heart failure treatment Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) – known as Vymada in India, Cosentyx (secukinumab, AIN457) – Scapho in India, and Kisqali (ribociclib, LEE011) – Kryxana in India.Entresto and Consentyx have emerged as best selling drugs in their categories.Tellmann said that stability of patent regime is also critical for India to attract investments from large drug companies."

title,Asus ROG Mothership review: Power meets innovation in a premium gaming laptop that’s everything but portable
datetime,2019-12-12 16:02:00+00:00
description,"As impressive as it is, the ROG Mothership simply isn’t functional as a gaming laptop."
content,"Gaming laptops have undergone several transformations over the years. While gaming laptops of the past have taken on big bulk form factors, modern gaming laptops balance the scales between power and portability.In fact, we can narrow premium gaming laptop designs down into three categories – sleek and stylish (Asus Zephyrus / Razer Blade), take no prisoners behemoths (MSI GT76 / Dell Alienware Area 51m), and the gaming-centric powerhouses (MSI GP75 Leopard and HP Omen X 2S) that aren’t sleek but not too big and heavy at the same time.But what we are speaking about at this moment is something different altogether. The Asus ROG Mothership isn’t like any gaming laptop you’ve seen before. Although you can call it a behemoth, its design defies the traditional norms of what a gaming laptop should look like but more on that later.The ROG Mothership packs a powerful 8-core CPU, the best-in-class GPU, faster storage, an impressive display, and more. So, without further delays, let’s dive into the beast that is the ROG Mothership.Design Defies ExpectationNo matter the crowd, the Mothership is bound to stand out. The Dell Alienware Area 51m was touted as a desktop replacement rather than a laptop because of the complete lack of portability and the challenge face while using it on the lap. Well, the Mothership follows the same no apologetic approach as the Area 51m, but using it on your lap goes from being a challenge to impossible. Using the Mothership without a table is simply not possible.When closed, the Mothership’s footprint is wide at 16.1 x 12.6 x 1.2 inches, and the laptop weighs about 4.7 kgs (10.5 pounds), and that’s without the two charging bricks. Unlike traditional laptops, all the components on the Mothership sit behind the screen. Those components make the back of the laptop pretty thick, which is why the screen is supported by a stand that requires a solid and flat surface to support the display.NoneIt’s safe to say that the keyboard on the Mothership isn’t like anything you have seen on traditional gaming laptops. Like Microsoft’s Surface Pro, the keyboard on the Mothership is detachable. When it is magnetically attached to the screen, the keyboard sits on a 10-degree incline, which makes it comfortable to type on without a wrist rest.When detached, the keyboard can be stretched out over a surface or folded and used on your lap. It connects wirelessly through 2.4GHz Wi-Fi or via a USB Type-C cable. Folding the keyboard is extremely convenient as you can place the laptop on a table and operate it from a distance. It comes in handy when you want to connect the laptop to a TV and use it from the couch.The keyboard itself is excellent for gaming and typing. The keys are well spaced out and bigger than traditional laptop keys. The actuation point of on the keys is pretty good, giving you a nice tactile bump. Since Asus sent us an engineering sample, the keyboard was a little glitchy. Although I’d give the title to the best gaming laptop keyboard to the Dell Alienware Area-51m, the Mothership isn’t that far behind.NoneA trackpad replaces the Numpad on the right of the keyboard. The trackpad features two clickable buttons that feel really nice. The trackpad can also be deactivated and replaced by a digital Numpad. With a click of a button, red backlit pad lights cover the trackpad. This isn’t the best trackpad, but since Asus includes a gaming mouse with the ROG Mothership, the only time you’ll find yourself using the touchpad is when you’re on a couch watching a movie need to quickly access an email or file.Ports Galore Because all of the components are housed in the display, all the ports on the machine are also located on either side of that screen, and there are a lot of them. On the right, you get a USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 port, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, which doubles as a DisplayPort 1.4 input.NoneAdditionally, there’s an SD card reader and two jacks for the two power adapters. Most importantly, and this took us a bit of time to find, the power button is located on the top right side of the Mothership. Three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a headphone jack, a microphone jack and a Gigabit Ethernet, all sit on the left of the device. There are so many ports on the Mothership, and it almost seems like a desktop, almost.Display Done RightThere are two display options on the ROG Mothership, both coming in at 17.3 inches. However, you can get the Mothership with a 4K UHD IPS panel with a 60Hz refresh rate or a 1080p IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate. The 4K display option seems to be aimed at content creators, while the 1080p screen looks ideal for gaming.The Mothership Asus sent us was equipped with a 17.3-inch 1080p screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time. Moreover, the display also featured Nvidia G-Sync support. Furthermore, the screen on the Mothership averages at 286 nits, which is still slightly brighter than the Dell Alienware Area-51m, but falls short of the category average. The Mothership’s screen also reproduces 102-percent of the sRGB gamut, above the 100-percent average.Because of the higher 144Hz refresh rate, the monitor is capable of replicating high frame rates put out by the graphics card. The panel on the Mothership delivers warm, realistic colours and does an excellent job of not oversaturating the picture. If you’re wondering, why not go for a 244Hz display; well, that’s simple.NoneWhen the ROG Mothership made its first debut at CES 2019, 240Hz gaming laptop screens were still in the making. Asus only launched the Strix Scar III in May 2019 as the first gaming laptop with a 240 Hz display. So, at the time of making, the 144Hz refresh rate, 3ms response time, and G-Sync support were as good as it got on a gaming laptop. Moreover, the difference in going from 144Hz to 240Hz is not a big jump as compared to 60Hz to 144Hz.The King of PerformanceThe Asus ROG Mothership is impressive. What the Mothership lacks in portability it more than makes up for in raw power. On the inside, the laptop packs an eight-core Intel Core i9-9800HK processor paired with 64GB of RAM and four 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe SSDs in RAID 0 configuration. Moreover, the Mothership also packs an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card; there no Max-Q here.The powerful CPU and GPU combination will guarantee every game is playable on maximum settings. We tested the Mothership with AAA and popular multiplayer titles. Before we get into the results, it’s worth noting that going above 144 fps won’t really make much of a difference as the 144Hz screen will no longer be able to keep up with the video card at that point.The AAA games we tested included Star Wards Jedi: Fallen Order and Far Cry 5, the former delivering between 95 fps on average, while the latter peaked at 143 fps and averaged out at 123 fps. The other two games tested included Anthem and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which yielded 80 fps and 122 fps on average. While Shadow of the Tomb Raider managed to hit 140 fps at times, Anthem failed to cross 100 with frame rates dropping to 65 during intense combat. All the AAA games tested were on their highest settings.NoneThe multiplayer games included Apex Legends, PUBG, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch. The Mothership doesn’t fail to deliver on the multiplayer front, with each one of the above-mentioned titles surpassing 144 fps on their highest possible settings. Battlefield V, which comes closer to a AAA title, was also tested in multiplayer, delivering frames rates anywhere between 111 and 143 fps on Ultra settings. On Battlefield V, you’ll also hit 60fps on ultra-settings with real-time ray tracing turned on.All games on the Mothership were tested on Turbo mode, which puts the fans in overdrive. While performance mode will offer a minimal drop in frame rates, it does keep the fans a little quitter at the cost of anywhere between 5 to 15 fps, depending on the game you’re playing.Beyond gaming, the Mothership is a pretty capable machine, racking up a  34,793 score in Geekbench 4.1’s synthetic overall performance test. We also ran the Cinebench R20 benchmark, in which the Mothership earned a single-core score of 503 and a multicore score of 4,809 on turbo settings.Cooling is a key factor in any gaming laptop, especially one with such powerful components. That being said, cooling on the ROG Mothership doesn’t disappoint. Asus has incorporated two fans with eight heat pipes that cover the CPU and GPU, as well as four thick heatsinks and large ventilation holes around the perimeter. Additionally, it also uses Thermal Grizzly Liquid Metal as opposed to the regular thermal paste. Liquid metal is supposed to keep the CPU up to 35-percent cooler.NoneIn addition to the advanced cooling system, the unique placement form factor helps further improve airflow. Placing components on the back of the system, instead of the bottom allows for better airflow and helps keep the system cool during taxing activities. Moreover, since the vents are located on the top four corners of the machine, hot air doesn’t reach your house hand. And since there’s nothing under the keyboard, you don’t have to worry about areas of your keyboard getting a bit warm.Our advice when using the Mothership, don’t have second thoughts about overclocking both the CPU and GPU. Thermal throttling on this machine is simply out of the question. Whether it’s gaming or productivity, the Mothership is undoubtedly going to get the job done with minimal effort.This machine is way ahead of the competition, only rivaled by the MSI GT76 Titan and Dell Alienware Area 51-m, both of which use desktop-grade Intel Core i9-9900K CPUs. In terms of overall performance, only the Area 51-m and GT76 Titan can go head-to-head with the Mothership.A for Audio QualityWhen it comes to gaming on any laptop, we’d recommend using headphones or external speakers. However, sound on the Mothership isn’t half bad; to be honest, it is actually pretty good. The Mothership packs four 4-watt speakers aimed directly at your face. The audio quality here is far better than the sound on most gaming laptops.NoneThe fans can get pretty loud on turbo but cannot drown out the audio on account of the powerful speakers. What’s more, audio quality is further improved when you detach the keyboard.Battery Exceeds ExpectationsDespite its 91Whr battery capacity, the ROG Mothership will not get you through even half a workday. But that’s not something out of the ordinary for a gaming laptop of this caliber. We got little under four and a half hours of battery life on a full charge in our web browsing test, while multitasking between Microsoft Office apps and Chrome delivered under 3hrs and 30mins of use time.NoneDuring our battery test, screen brightness was reduced to 50-percent, and Nvidia Optimus was enabled switching from the RTX 2080 to Intel’s integrated graphics. Additionally, RGB lighting on the laptop was turned off, while the keyboard was detached. For a laptop, this powerful, battery life is expected to be poor. But the ROG Mothership exceeded expectations, doing much better than the category average. If you aren’t undertaking intensive tasks, there’s also no need for both chargers; one will suffice.VerdictThe Asus ROG Mothership is exactly what you’d expect in an over-the-top gaming behemoth like this. There’s absolutely no compromise here, Asus delivers on all fronts.Performance exceeds expectations, primarily because of that improved cooling system and new form factor. The screen is arguably one of the best in the business, while the design doesn’t apologise for what it is, a gaming behemoth.But beyond performance and display, there are other things that Asus certainly hasn’t skimped on, like the audio quality and the overall keyboard experience. When we first got the Mothership, we expected battery life to be sub-par at best, considering the hardware. But that isn’t the case at all; the Mothership exceeded all expectations and fares much better than the competition.NoneThe ROG Mothership is perfect in almost every year except one, ""it doesn’t really qualify as a laptop"". We see the Mothership as more of an all-in-one desktop replacement than a gaming laptop. And for many, it will be much cheaper to build a powerful desktop than to buy a Mothership. However, the ROG Mothership is aimed at a niche audience for whom having everything in one portable unit would outweigh the cost.The Asus ROG Mothership isn’t available in for sale in India, but the model we tested costs $5,499 (Approx. Rs 3,92,100) in the US. So, it is safe to assume that the Mothership doesn’t come cheap. It is more expensive than any other gaming laptop, including the Dell Alienware Area 51-m. However, the Asus ROG Mothership isn’t your average powerhouse gaming laptop; it isn’t even your average desktop replacement (Like the GT76 Titan and Area 51-m); it is something else altogether."

title,Taxability of gifts received by NRIs from Indians
datetime,2019-12-10 14:58:00+00:00
description,"A sum of money received without consideration, is deemed to accrue or arise in India"
content,"Sanjeev PanditFor non-residents, only the income which is received or accrued or which is deemed to have been received or accrued in India is taxable in India. A few years back, the Income Tax Act was amended and gifts in excess of Rs 50,000 received by a person became taxable in the hands of the recipient. This is applicable to gifts in the form of money, immovable property, shares and securities, bullion and few other types of assets. In the case of a non-resident, the gift of immovable property, shares and securities etc. became taxable since the gifted assets are in India. So, the gift transaction was completed in India and it satisfied the condition of income received in India.Changed tax rulesHowever, gifts received by non-residents by way of remittance from India were not chargeable to tax in India since the gift transaction was complete only when the money was received by the non-resident in a foreign bank account outside India. So the income in the form of gift of money remitted from India was neither received in India by the non-resident nor accrued in India nor was it deemed to have been received or accrued in India. It was therefore not chargeable to tax in India in the hands of the non-resident.Under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) formulated under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), a resident Indian can remit amount up to $250,000 a year for various purposes mentioned in the LRS. This includes remittance towards gift, donation, maintenance of close relatives etc. Under this scheme, a resident can remit to a non-resident by way of gift even if the non-resident was not a relative of the person remitting the money. Earlier, such a gift was not taxable in India in the hands of the non-resident.With a view to plug this loophole, the law has been amended. It is now provided that the sum of money received without consideration, is deemed to accrue or arise in India. With this change in the law, gift received by a non-resident by way of remittance from India would be chargeable to tax in India.However, a gift received by non-resident, if it is from certain specified relatives, is not treated as income and is not chargeable to tax in the hands of the non-resident. So if a father remits a large sum of money by way of gift to his son or daughter who has settled abroad, the gift will not be taxable in India in the hands of the non-resident daughter or son. Father falls under the list of relatives and a gift from the father is not treated as income in the hands of the recipient.Taxing giftsIf the gift becomes taxable since it is from a person who is not a relative, there are other consequences as well. When a person makes a payment of any taxable income to a non-resident, the payer has to deduct or withhold tax at source from such payment. Since the gift would be taxed as income, the payer will have to obtain a Tax Deduction Account number (TAN), deduct tax, fill up forms showing the tax deduction while remitting the funds and file a return for the tax deducted. The non-resident recipient, on his part, will have to file income tax return in India, declaring his/her income.While this is the position under the Income Tax Act, the income by way of gift may still escape taxation if India has an agreement (treaty) with the country in which the recipient of the gift is a resident and such an agreement does not grant India the right to tax `other income,’ i.e., income other than income specifically mentioned in various clauses of the treaty. Income by way of gift will generally fall outside the scope of such clauses, giving India the right to tax. In such a case, the provision of the tax treaty will prevail over the provision of the Income Tax Act and the amount will not be taxable in India. There are many countries with which India has signed treaties that do not give India the right to tax `other income.’A change in the law that deems the receipt of money as accruing in India will also apply to receipts by non-resident entities who may not be individuals. A donation made to a non-resident charitable organisation or a donation to your college or university as an alumnus would come under the amended provision and will be income of the non-resident charitable organisation, college or university taxable in India. But if there is a treaty between India and the other country, the donation escapes taxation in India."

title,Ningbo’s rise as the world’s largest port has lessons for India
datetime,2019-12-11 16:43:00+00:00
description,What is even more interesting is that seven of the top ten ports are now from China.
content,"NoneDespite the overall slowing of global trade, the official said cargo volumes at Ningo-Zhoushan would be higher this year.NoneNingo-Zhoushan has managed to race past Shanghai (see chart). Around a decade ago, the largest port used to be Singapore. Then it became Shanghai and now it is Ningbo-Zhoushan. What is even more interesting is that seven of the top ten ports are now from China.But Ningbo’s growth is not unexpected. It has been a trading port for over 2,000 years. It had extensive trading links with India. As described by author Kanakalatha Mukund in her book titled The World of the Tamil Merchant (Penguin), there is enough evidence of the way Indian merchants from South India traded extensively with China. “The goods traded covered a vast range of utility and luxury products from food grains and pepper to cloth, aromatic substances and precious gems like corals and pearls”.And as trade developed, “the ports on the east and west coasts of India, strategically located in the geographic centre of this region, became entrepôts of commercial exchange and of cultural diffusion since merchant ships from the west rarely sailed further east beyond the Bay of Bengal, while the ships from the east, especially China, did not venture further west than the ports of Kerala,” explained Mukund.NoneIndian merchants, even then, acknowledged the superior maritime skills and power of China, and often paid tributes to China’s kings: “For more than one millennium, [Chinese] kingdoms retained strong links with India through religious and cultural interactions. However, China was the great empire and political power for the entire region and embassies were regularly sent to the Chinese court by all the kingdoms—Champa, Kambuja and the Sailendras of Sri Vijaya—which implicitly acknowledged the superior status of China as a superpower both politically and economically. The embassies sent to China by the Chola emperors, Rajaraja I in 1015, Rajendra I in 1033 and Kulottunga I in 1077, in effect, accepted the centrality of China for maintaining the political and economic power balance in the region.”India lost that sense of perspective, and actually tried to minimise trade with China, much to its own disadvantage.So why did India lose out on maritime trade? Just look at the numbers. The entire country accounted for cargo volumes of under 500 million tonnes in 2017 (the latest figures given out by the maritime trade as yet). In China, just one port, Ningbo, accounted for over a billion tonnes.NoneThe government still talks about government-owned ports as major ports, even though its share of cargo business in India has been shrinking year after year (see chart). The ministry refuses to give data on non-government ports, and when it does so, it is scant. Instead of looking at the entire country’s maritime business, it seems keen on projecting just government-owned ports.NoneThird, India has always looked at export and import with suspicion. It has not encouraged and trusted trade. As a result, both imports and exports have suffered, and consequently India’s growth as well.Fourth, culturally, India was distrustful of the sea. As a result, crossing the seas was discouraged. When people like Mahatma Gandhi and Lokmanya Tilak went overseas for higher studies and returned to India, they had to undergo purification rites (shuddhikaran). Even mythology shows Lord Rama, in search of his kidnapped wife, opt to build a bridge across the seas to reach Sri Lanka when boats could have sufficed. He was warned by the ocean gods not to cross the seas by boats. As a result, much of sea trade was carried on by non-Hindu communities (till some of them were adopted and merged into the Hindu mainstream). As a result, India did not develop naval strength.Instead Ningbo, which has quietly, though the centuries, kept building its maritime capabilities and trade volumes. China has obviously learnt from Singapore and Hong Kong, that for volumes to grow, one needs to be more efficient, less bureaucratic, so as to convert its best ports into trans-shipment hubs. Both Singapore and Hong Kong consume a fraction of the cargo throughput. The rest moves on to other destinations. India has not been nimble on this front as well.Ningbo’s rise as a port thus has several lessons for India. It shows how a country’s ports can continue growing in spite of a global economic slowdown. It shows how maritime trade and economic prosperity are closely intertwined, as are cultural linkages between countries. Even today, additional investments are being made to make this a truly multi-modal port with air, road and rail linkages. Moreover, it is immensely profitable. It is listed on the stock markets, and made a net profit of RMB 5 billion (one RMB or yuan is worth around 10 rupees) and expects to grow further in time to come. The entire profit came from loading and unloading businesses and does not include any space rental business income at all.Can Indian ports become this big? Yes, only if government policies are conducive, and growth, not politics, assumes prime focus.The author is consulting editor with Moneycontrol."

description,"– PMAY: Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is an initiative taken by the government of India to provide affordable houses by 2020 to every homeless person. Check out the eligibility, types, features & benefits of PMAY at Moneycontrol."
content,"Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana  (PMAY) is a flagship project of the Government of India that aims to provide affordable housing for the urban poor, rural poor, and other sections of the society who are homeless. The scheme was launched in 2015 with an aim  to build 20 million houses by 2020. There are two categories of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana:Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban: This has specific project verticals to address the needs of those who are in urban areas. Individuals who belong to Economically Weak Section or Low Income Group or Middle Income Group can also avail of the benefits under this scheme.Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin: Under this category, those who are homeless or reside in zero, one or two-room kutcha houses as per the data collected from the Socio-Economic and Caste Census 2011 are eligible to avail of the benefits.As mentioned above, there are two categories of PMAY:This scheme covers approximately one crore households that are currently in kutcha houses. If eligible under PMAY-G, the beneficiaries will receive unit assistance of  Rs 1.20 Lakh for houses in the plains and Rs 1.30 Lakhs for houses located in hilly areas, difficult to access areas,Every year a large number of migrant workforces come to urban areas in search of jobs. However, the lack of affordable housing options for these workforces results in such people finding accommodation in slums and informal settlements. In fact, India's total urban housing shortage is projected to be about 30 million by 2022. In rural areas, individuals who do not have access to sufficient financial resources reside in kutcha houses or houses that are in dilapidated condition.The primary objective of PMAY is to provide affordable housing for all by 2022.  The housing options provided are meant to be sustainable and eco-friendly.  PMAY also aims to make housing accessible to specific target groups such as those who do not have enough economic resources, women, individuals who belong to the minorities such as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, widows of military personnel, transgender people, elderly persons, etc. The Government also provides particular preference to those who are differently abed or are senior citizens. Every house constructed under the aegis of PMAY should be designed and built to meet the requirements of structural safety against earthquake, flood, cyclone, landslides, etc.The eligible beneficiaries should not own a pucca house in any part of the country. In the case of the applicants from the Economically Weaker Sections or Low Income Group, there should be at least one female owner of the house.PMAY Urban has the following components:NoneNoneNoneNoneThe process to apply for PMAY benefits is different for PMAY Urban and PMAY Gramin.Aadhar card is a mandatory requirement. If you do not have access to your Aadhar card, you can use the Virtual Identification Number.If your application for the credit-linked subsidy scheme is approved, your bank will claim the subsidy from the National Housing Bank (NHB). It will also present relevant data and reports to NHB for verification of the claim submitted.  NHB will carry out due diligence and sanction the subsidy amount to your bank.  The subsidy amount will be credited by NHB to your bank.  Once your bank receives the subsidy, the amount will be credited to your account. Your EMI will be adjusted accordingly.As a beneficiary, you are eligible to construct or purchase the house in any Statutory Towns as per Census 2011 and towns notified.  The Government will also inform the Planning Area as with respect to the Statutory Towns and which surrounds the concerned Municipal area. This is important for providing the interest subsidy to those belonging to the Middle Income Group.You are not allowed to build or construct a house outside India with the assistance of PMAY.The methodology of deciding the ownership rights of the houses to be allotted under HFAPoA will be as per the discretion of the State Government/Union Territory, as the case may be. Suitable restrictions may be imposed on the transfer restrictions of such properties.Yes, groups of slums can be considered as a unit for in-situ development under PMAY.In order to effectively monitor the progress of the PMAY scheme, the AwaasSoft platform is used for collating data and generating performance reports. It helps to monitor the performance on the basis of varied parameters of performance."

title,Here's why music OTTs are striking a chord with non-music content
datetime,2019-12-10 20:56:00+00:00
description,"Music OTT (over the top) platforms are experimenting with non-music content like podcasts, interviews, story-telling and even video shows."
content,"If you think music is the best bet for music streaming platforms in India, think again. In fact, it is the non-music category that these platforms are banking on.But why?Talking to Moneycontrol, Prashan Agarwal, CEO, Gaana, said, “People have been consuming more radio content and consumption has moved to digital. Story-telling, comedy shows and shows on music – all have been a part of radio programming.” This is what people want to consume on music streaming platforms as well.He added that while the audience is niche for such content, it is this audience that drives engagement and retention on the platforms.Hence, music OTT (over the top) platforms are experimenting with non-music content like podcasts, interviews, story-telling and even video shows.When it comes to podcasts, major music OTTs are increasing their focus. JioSaavn, which launched podcasts on its platform in 2016, has since then increased its podcast catalog ten-fold.NoneRecently, Spotify announced its first three original podcasts in India which went live from December 3.In an earlier interview to Moneycontrol, Amarjit Singh Batra, MD, India, Spotify had said that over time, 20 percent of all Spotify listening will be non-music content.Same is the case with Gaana, that is increasing its non-music portfolio by getting 3,000 podcasts by March-end next year; of which 40-50 would be Gaana originals.For podcasts, Gaana is looking at achieving 100 million streams a month and sees around three percent of consumption coming from podcasts by March, 2020.Among genres, Agarwal thinks that comedy and devotional will be the biggest section.While most music OTTs have their eyes on growing the podcast portfolio, Hungama is experimenting with non-music content in a different way.Hungama is not moving away from the core content i.e. music. It is creating programs around music, case in point being Hungama Music Room.“This was an informal conversation with music celebrities that gives users a chance to see their favorite artists in an unedited way. It is an audio-visual product where we get into the life, struggle, and challenges of the artists. So, we got a lot of artists sharing their stories and playing music. We had Armaan Malik, Badshah, among others,” said Siddhartha Roy, COO, Hungama Digital Media.Now, Hungama is coming up with Hungama Music Bus, which is like a concert-on-wheels, a property which will feature musicians like Harrdy Sandhu, Jassie Gill, Indian Ocean, Javed Ali, among others.But what is non-music about this?“Hungama will also be creating a full-fledged series of six episodes, each of 22-minute length, which will talk about music in places like Ambala, Karnal, Bhubaneshwar where we talk about local bands. Artists like Harrdy Sandhu or Javed Ali may interact with the local bands and then perform for the local crowds,"" Roy said."

title,Classroom | How do I monitor my MF investments? (Mutual Funds Part 8)
datetime,2019-12-10 17:28:00+00:00
description,This part of MF Classroom will give you tips to monitor your fund investments efficiently.
content,"Part 8 of the Classroom series on mutual funds tells you how to keep track of your investment in funds in a hassle-free manner and make sure you get your account statements regularly. Q. How do I monitor my mutual fund investments?NoneThe easiest way to track your own portfolio is to simply ask your distributor or financial advisor to give you a statement of your holdings. If you invest through an online platform, then your job becomes much easier because the moment you log in online, you can see your portfolio and how it has been doing.Alternatively, you can call up individual fund houses or go to a large registrar and transfer agent’s website and request an account statement. This account statement will give you a status report of your investments that includes your name, address, mode of holding, which funds you’ve invested in, the cost at which you bought them and their latest value. The two major R&Ts that offer this facility are Computer Age Management Systems (Cams) and Karvy Computershare.Q. How do I get my account statements?NoneAs soon as invest in a fund house, it sends you an account statement. It sends you either a physical one or through email if you have registered one. Your fund house also sends you a statement over email after every systematic investment plan (SIP) made.At the beginning of every month, you also get a common account statement (CAS) if there has been any action in any of your mutual fund folios in the previous month, such as a SIP or lump-sum investment made, a dividend declared or if some redemption has happened. If you have a demat account, then you get a common account statement from any of the two depositories (National Securities Depository or NSDL and the Central Depository Services India or CDSL. This CAS also contains all details of transactions done in the previous month on all capital market instruments as well as your consolidated holdings.If you do not have a demat account, then the registrar & transfer (R&T) agents will send you a combined CAS of just your mutual fund holdings.Additionally, you can also call up your fund house or your MF’s R&T and request for an account statement. You can also visit the websites of the two large R&Ts in the MF industry (Computer Age Management Systems or Cams and Karvy Computershare) and request a CAS across all your mutual fund holdings. All you have to do is enter your Permanent Account Number (PAN) and your email address and all your MF holdings mapped to these two details get pulled out and into a statement and emailed to you. Some fund houses have also started a missed call service. Just call up the number from your registered mobile number and you will soon get an account statement.Q. If I miss an account statement, can I request my fund house to send me a duplicate?NoneNoneNoneQ. What are folio numbers? And how do they hold the key to good monitoring and low paperwork?A. A folio number is a unique identity number – typically in alpha-numeric codes – given to your mutual fund investment. The folio number is specific to a single fund house only. If you have investments in four mutual fund schemes across four different fund houses, you will get four different folio numbers.But what if you invest in four funds within the same fund house? Here, if you do not quote your folio number when you invest incrementally (additional investments done over a period of time), you are allotted multiple folios. Try to have a single folio with every fund house you invest in. The benefit of having minimal folio numbers is that you get all your details in a single account statement. Although you get a CAS, you can also avail a single folio statement. And for this, it pays if all your investments in a single fund house are within a single folio."

title,Are India’s Consistent Compounders maxed out?
datetime,2019-12-10 10:08:00+00:00
description,"Worries mostly relate to the growth runway, given their large size and already dominant market shares"
content,"Saurabh Mukherjea and Rakshit RanjanOne of the first steps we take in our research process while trying to identify a ‘Consistent Compounder’ is a 10-year or longer historical track record of consistent and healthy fundamentals. In fact, many firms in our holding portfolio and our coverage universe have delivered more than 20 years of consistency of healthy fundamentals. Such a long and consistent track record clearly means that by now most of our portfolio companies have become large in size (in terms of revenues, volumes, market share and the like).Another way of looking at the growth runwayWhat prevents consistent compounders from saturating in their growth potential?ConclusionsCompanies like HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Relaxo have already delivered consistently healthy growth in their fundamentals over the past decade or longer. However, given the long and consistent historical track record of these companies, some investors are concerned around saturation of the growth runway for these firms, given their large size versus global players in similar categories and their already dominant market shares.Firms of the calibre of HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance and Relaxo overcome these potential challenges by: a) orienting their product portfolio towards a high volume of small-ticket day-to-day essentials in a country which offers a long runway for growth in middle class household consumption and b) executing business expansion through institutionalised systems and processes, minimising product price hikes, and successfully expanding their product portfolio over time in adjacent product categories."

title,ArcelorMittal vs JSW Steel: The rivalry now plays out in the mines
datetime,2019-12-10 20:17:00+00:00
description,Neither has mines that meet all of their requirements for iron ore and coal
content,"NoneMittal is the CFO of ArcelorMittal and son of founder Lakshmi Niwas Mittal. Parth joined his father Sajjan Jindal's JSW Group three years ago and heads the cement and paints businesses.NoneAccepting Parth's wishes on the takeover of Essar Steel, Aditya said that despite ArcelorMittal's numero uno status in the world steel industry, when it comes to India, it is JSW Steel that has set the benchmark.The bonhomie between the two scions though can barely keep the wraps on the intense competition between the two leading companies.NoneThe competition, industry experts said, will now play out more as the same auction takes off, and many more mines come on the block before the March 31, 2020 deadline.Overall, about 300 mining leases are set to expire in March next year. These mines are at present mostly owned by merchant miners and will now be auctioned in what will be windfall for the government.The auction in Odisha saw more than 50 companies participating, with the competition being intense. But when it comes to steel companies, none other than ArcelorMittal and JSW Steel will be more than keen to get their hands on iron ore reserves.NoneThat is thanks to the considerable deposits of iron ore that Tata Steel has in its captive mines. These mines in Odisha and Jharkhand meet all the iron ore requirements of Tata Steel and about 30 percent of its coal needs.Iron ore and coal are used as raw materials in steel making.JSW Steel, on the other hand, has historically depended on the market for its raw material supplies. It has had small victories in recent times, having won rights to mines in Karnataka. But these are small -- with reserves of 93 million tonne and annual production of about 7.5 MT -- meeting about 35 percent of its needs.The mines in Odisha, on the other hand, will have reserves of nearly 600 MT.Having own mines makes sense especially during an economic slowdown, like the present one. And this year's slowdown was marked by low steel prices, but high rates of iron ore and coal, a situation that harms margins even more.""Mines are like a lifeline for the bottomline. To become the market leader, mines are the only way,"" a senior industry executive said.This is the same reason that is driving ArcelorMittal and why it hopes to close the Essar Steel acquisition by 2019-end.Essar Steel, which has its manufacturing facility in Gujarat's Hazira, doesn't have a mine. But it does have access to Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure (OSPL), which supplies iron ore to Essar Steel's pellet plant in Odisha. The pellets are then taken to Hazira to be used in Essar Steel's plants.While ArcelorMittal has emerged as the highest bidder for OSPL, it will want more mines under its kitty, to bring down the manufacturing cost at Essar Steel. Globally, it has a large mining operations with annual production of nearly 60 MT of iron ore and about 5 MT of coking coal.For sure, ArcelorMittal will want to bring all that prowess on the table, as it vies for the mines. JSW Steel, on the other hand, would want to maintain an upper hand in the Indian market.The competitionThe first glimpse of the competition came not in India, but in Italy, where both ArcelorMittal and JSW Steel were interested in Ilva, the country's largest steelmaker. While ArcelorMittal eventually took control of the company, JSW Steel bought Aferpi, another Italian steel mill.Earlier this year, the two again found themselves across the table, this time for Essar Steel. With bids of both ArcelorMittal and Numetal under the regulator's eye (both had to clear Clause 29A of IBC that barred defaulting promoters from bidding for stressed assets), JSW Steel evinced its interest in Essar Steel.This was despite not having put in an Express of Interest when the insolvency process started off. The expression of interest is needed to submit a bid. Eventually, JSW Steel pulled itself out of the Essar Steel race."

title,Jharkhand Election Result 2019 | Hemant Soren: The man who could be the next Chief Minister
datetime,2019-12-23 22:25:00+00:00
description,"According to a survey, Soren is the most popular CM candidate with 29 percent of those surveyed having declared him as their choice for the post. "
content,"With early trends suggesting that the Congress-led Grand Alliance might come to power in Jharkhand, the pre-poll alliance's chief ministerial face, Hemant Soren, is all set to be the man in the limelight.This would not be the first time that Hemant is the man of the moment, however. He has helmed the top post once before, even though it was for a short period of time.In order to script his political trajectory, Hemant had to come out of the shadows of his father, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) supremo Shibu Soren and that of his elder brother, Durga Soren, who was a legislator and potential heir to the Soren family's legacy before his death in 2009.From 2009, when he was still being considered a political novice but was made the chief of JMM core committee, to 2014 when he was projected as the chief ministerial face, Hemant has had a calculated rise, experts suggest.During 2014, the JMM was hoping to project Hemant as the young face with the backing of the old order (read Shibu Soren), but that did not work. The JMM became only the second-largest party after the BJP, and could not form the government. But this did not lead to the sentiment going against JMM or Hemant, analysts say.Experts suggest that it was the 2014 state elections that helped Hemant set a firm foot in state politics, since it was he who had led the party campaign from the front.Hemant was born in undivided Bihar and was educated in Patna. He has studied at the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra and is known to be an introvert. He had served as a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) from 2009 to 2010, and was made the deputy chief minister of Jharkhand in the Arjun Munda-led NDA government from 2010 to 2013."

description,NCLAT holds that the appointment of N Chandrasekaran was illegal.
content,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has restored Cyrus Mistry as the Executive Chairman of the Tata Group.NCLAT upheld that the appointment of N Chandrasekaran was illegal.A window of four weeks has, however, been allowed by the NCLAT on the reinstatement of Cyrus Mistry which means Tata Sons can appeal before the Supreme Court within these four weeks against restoring Mistry as the executive chairman.The NCLAT noted that there was 'prejudicial' behaviour from the Tata Sons board towards the minority shareholders. It also noted that the manner of removal of Mistry was hasty.NoneThe NCLAT has also given clear directions to Ratan Tata to maintain arms-length distance as far as Tata Sons board is concerned.The Registrar of Companies decision to change Tata Sons from public to private company has also been set aside.This is a verdict that will have an impact on the board rooms across India Inc, said Satish Kishanchandani, Managing Partner, Pioneer Legal.“At the same time, there are questions about how this will be implemented. Will all the decision taken by the current Chairman remain valid,” he asked.“The courts have said, what we always maintained, that the way the board conducted itself in October 2016 was illegal. Too early for anyone to digest the verdict and think next steps. What is clear is that the truth does not change regardless of how the court verdicts have gone or may go in the future,” said Prof Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor of marketing at Singapore Management University & Distinguished Fellow INSEAD Emerging Markets Institute.Kumar was the former director and always on Mistry’ camp. He left soon after Mistry’s exit.NoneNoneThe NCLAT judgement today came on a petition moved by former Tata Group Chairman Cyrus P Mistry and his two investment firms -- Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments Corp -- challenging his removal from the group.A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya pronounced judgement over the petitions.Mistry, who had taken over as the sixth chairman of Tata Sons in 2012 after Ratan Tata announced his retirement, was ousted from the position in October 2016.Mistry and Tata family patriarch Ratan Tata had a falling out over key investment decisions, including manufacturing of world's cheapest car Nano. Mistry challenged his removal in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).The Shapoorji Pallonji group hold over 18 percent stake in Tata Sons while the Tata Trusts and Tata Group companies along with Tata family members collectively hold the balance over 81 percent of the total shareholding.The Mumbai bench of the NCLT had, however, in July last year dismissed pleas by the Mistry camp against his removal and allegations of misconduct on part of the board. The bench had also said Mistry was ousted as chairman because the Tata Sons' Board and its majority shareholders had “lost confidence in him"".Mistry had then challenged the order in the NCLAT.Two months after his removal, Mistry's family-run firms approached the NCLT as minority shareholders, against Tata Sons, Ratan Tata, and some other board members.Mistry had argued that his removal was not in accordance with the Companies Act and that there was rampant mismanagement of affairs across Tata Sons."

description,"Earlier this month, a war of words erupted between Chaturvedi and Amruta Fadnavis on social media over media reports that the Uddhav Thackeray government was planning to cut down around 1,000 trees in Aurangabad to build a memorial for Bal Thackeray."
content,"The war of words between the banker wife of Maharashtra's former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi has become the latest talking point in state political circles.It all began with a tweet by Amruta Fadnavis who attacked Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray while responding to her husband's tweet - posted eight days ago - to condemn Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his ""My name is not Rahul Savarkar"" remark.Fadnavis had said Rahul Gandhi was nowhere close to even a single deed of Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar.Taking a cue from her husband's comment, Amruta Fadnavis on Sunday taunted the Shiv Sena president, saying one cannot be a 'Thackeray' just by putting Thackeray after his name.""Very true @Dev_Fadnavis ji ! One cannot be a Thackeray also by just putting Thackrey surname after his name! One needs to be true, principled & should think for betterment of people & party members above his own family & power dynamics! @ShivSena @OfficeofUT,"" she tweeted.Hitting back, Chaturvedi on Monday said Thackeray was living up to his name and Amruta Fadnavis, a professional banker, was missing the point.""Yes he is living up to his surname, but you as usual missed the news - promises fulfilled, principled commitment & working for welfare of his people-farmer loan waiver, Rs 10 meal, CM office in every division,"" she tweeted.""All this in a month of forming govt PS:Thankfully not into singing his own praises,"" Chaturvedi said, the sarcasm aimed at Amruta Fadnavis, who is s a trained classical singer, and has performed at various cultural and social events.Targeting Amruta Fadnavis, Shiv Sena corporator Amey Ghole equated her with Anandibai, infamous in Maharashtra's history for plotting the death of her 17-year-old nephew Peshwa Narayanrao. Her husband Raghunathrao was next in line for the throne at the time of Narayanrao's death.In a tweet, Ghole said Anandibai was responsible for her husband Raghunathrao being dubbed a villain (for the death of Narayanrao) and advised the banker not to forget history.Earlier this month, a war of words erupted between Chaturvedi and Amruta Fadnavis on social media over media reports that the Uddhav Thackeray government was planning to cut down around 1,000 trees in Aurangabad to build a memorial for Bal Thackeray.Amruta Fadnavis had posted a photograph of a newspaper report on the Shiv Sena's reported plan to cut the trees along with a tweet: ""Hypocrisy is a disease! Get well soon @ShivSena! Tree cutting -- at ur convenience or allowing tree cutting only when you earn commission -- unpardonable sins!!""She was referring to the Shiv Sena's opposition to the cutting of trees for the Metro Line 3 car shed at Mumbai's Aarey Colony over environmental concerns, and Uddhav Thackeray staying work on the structure in one of his first major decisions after taking over as the chief minister.That was when Priyanka Chaturvedi made an appearance, pointedly telling Amruta Fadnavis that ""compulsive lying is a bigger disease"" than hypocrisy.""Ma'am, sorry to disappoint you but the truth is that not a single tree will be cut for the memorial, and the mayor has confirmed it too. Also, just to be clear, compulsive lying is a bigger disease, get well soon,"" she had then tweeted, questioning if the commission to cut trees was a ""new policy measure"" promoted by the Maharashtra BJP."

India has long been identified as an attractive market for our company and we have been looking at suitable opportunities to build a meaningful production presence in the country for over a decade.""""Both India and Essar’s appeal are enduring. Essar has sizeable, profitable, well-located operations and the long-term growth potential for the Indian economy and therefore Indian steel demand are well known,"" the billionaire entrepreneur added.The announcement also brings closure to one of the most keenly fought corporate battles, which started in August 2017, after Essar Steel was admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal. The company owed more than Rs 49,000 crore to dozen banks. State Bank of India has among the highest exposure, with over Rs 15,000 crore.

Even though the management believes that margins would likely increase going forward, the brokerage has a cautious approach towards the issue due to following reasons:One is the outstanding litigations against the company. The promoters of the company are partners in Aditya Developers, who has JV with Montana Developers in 2010. The promoter group of the company have contingent liabilities of Rs 904 crore through aditya developers towards Montana developers in damages. Any adverse outcome in these litigations could have an impact on the business, said the brokerage.Second is that as compared to industry, the company has slightly higher levels of debt in the capital structure. ""Even though the company is working on the margins and the management believes that the margins are likely to improve in the upcoming quarters, we remain skeptical about the same,"" Anand Rathi said.The leading polymer pipes and fittings manufacturer already garnered Rs 150 crore from anchor investors on December 17, ahead of its initial public offering.The company intends to utilise the net proceeds from fresh issue for the repayment or prepayment of certain outstanding loans, financing the project cost towards establishment of a new manufacturing facility, upgradation of equipment at the manufacturing facilities and general corporate purposes.

It has a market share of 5 percent in FY19 and is amongst the top six organized players in the market. Its fitting segment enjoys a higher margin due to the specialized nature and precision required,"" said the brokerage.""The company is not only in pipe manufacturing but also providing end-to-end piping system solutions. Its products have a wide range of applications in the fields of plumbing, irrigation and soil, waste and rainwater management,"" it added.Equirus also recommended subscribing the issue as valuation discount to peers and industry tailwind will provide listing gains.""Prince Pipes, the 6th largest pipe player in the industry with largest SKUs of fittings, is well placed to capitalize on ongoing megatrend of unorganized to organized, higher irrigation spending, replacement and new demand from plumbing/drainage,"" the brokerage said.With EBITDA margin at 12 percent against 14-16 percent for Supreme/Astral there is likely upside in margin with operating leverage, according to the brokerage which said IPO was to fund Telangana plant and to reduce leverage at Promoter group level; Pre-money at FY19 EV/EBITDA of 11x, P/E of 20x; 20-80 percent gap with peers provided one-time valuation jump to IPO investors.Prince, one of the leading players in PVC pipes segment with market share of 5 percent, is planning to increase its capacity to around 3,00,000 by FY22 from around 241,000 currently with focus on higher margin business.It has healthy return ratios with average return on equity (RoE) of 22 percent and return on capital employed (RoCE) of 20 percent for the same period.""Assuming revenue growth of 13 percent CAGR through FY19-21E, the company is valued at 14x of FY21E earnings, which appears to be justified considering its business model, steady growth and healthy return ratios. Hence, we recommend subscribe to the issue,"" Reliance Securities said.As of October 2019, the total installed capacity of Prince Pipes' six existing plants was 2,41,211 tonnes per annum and Prince Pipes plans to expand the installed capacity at its plant in Jobner in Rajasthan from 6,221 tonnes per annum as on October 31, 2019 to 17,021 tonnes per annum by December 31, 2019 and to 20,909 tonnes per annum by the end of fiscal year 2020.As at October 2019, Prince Piping Systems products sells its products to 1,151 distributors in India. It sells Trubore products directly to wholesalers and retailers.Going forward, Religare Broking believes Prince Pipes performance would continue to improve as well as the company would gain market share in the organized segment driven by positive sector outlook, better product mix and increased focus on high margins business.""On valuation front, the company is valued at a P/E of 23.5x on FY19 EPS at upper price band of Rs 178, which is decent considering the company’s promising long-term growth prospects,"" the brokerage said.However, the company has higher debt compared to its peers but on absolute basis it at comfortable levels (D/E 0.6x), it added.According to Motilal Oswal, investors can subscribe the IPO from a listing gains perspective. ""The issue is priced at 23.5x FY19 EPS (fully diluted).

Here’s how the year-old governments have fared:RajasthanIn Rajasthan, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has claimed that he and his cabinet colleagues have provided sensitive, transparent and accountable administration as expected by the people.The Congress came to power in the state last year and Ashok Gehlot was sworn in as the chief minister on December 17, 2018.Deputy CM Sachin Pilot said the government has worked for the interests of every section of society.To mark the day, the state government organised several programmes.However, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje alleged that the Congress government, which is divided into two factions, has failed to keep up its promises and is celebrating one year of misgovernance. She further said every class, including farmers, youth, women, businessmen and employees, are ""feeling cheated and are distressed by the chaos that has spread in the last one year"".Madhya PradeshIn December 2018, Congress formed the government in Madhya Pradesh under Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

You need deep pockets, Uday has that,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said at Times Network's India Economic Conclave here.When the same question was posed to third-largest lender Axis Bank's Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, it was answered with the same suggestion.""We (Axis Bank) are a smaller bank. We are trying to ensure that we grow big so that at some stage we can acquire others. So, yes Mr Kotak, they are best suited rather than us,"" he said.When contacted, Kotak Mahindra Group Chief Communication Officer Rohit Rao said, ""these are comments made by other bankers and reflect their views, and not ours"".In the past, both Axis Bank and KMB have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank.According to some watchers, acquiring a bank can help Uday Kotak reduce the promoter stake in KMB, and help him get closer to the levels mandated by the RBI.The regulator has been dragged to the court by KMB for not accepting an earlier attempt at stake dilution and the same petition is slated to be heard early next year.Meanwhile, speaking at the same event, Kotak said there is a need to resist a ""colonialisation"" of Indian finance, hinting at share sales to foreign investors.""I'm looking forward to best in class quality but strong Indian-owned and controlled financial sector and while we must attract foreign capital, we must ensure that there is no colonialisation of Indian finance,"" Kotak said.Yes Bank had to cut its book size by 7 per cent in the September quarter because of the capital constraints and has been looking to finish the capital raising exercise at the earliest.The lender had first announced it has interest from investors of USD 3 billion, and a few days later disclosed offers of USD 2 billion. It wanted to finalise the same at the last board meet on December 10 but was not able to take a decision."

The rest of the amount will be paid to Prince Muffakham Jah (£1.8 million) and the eighth Nizam Mukarram Jah (£795,064.63).Years ago, the two princes had questioned Pakistan’s allegations that the sum kept in the London bank was meant for a cache of arms to be supplied to the princely state of Hyderabad, which was later annexed by India. The Nizam had reportedly sent the amount for safekeeping to the then Pakistan ambassador Habib Ibrahim Rahimtoola.Content with the court verdict, Mukarram’s lawyer Paul Hewitt said: “Today’s hearing brings this litigation, which started in 2013 but where the underlying dispute dates back to in 1948, to an end at long last.” He also informed that the neighbouring country has decided to not challenge the ruling."

title,Unilever sales outlook cut – It's a surprise. What do you make of it?

content,"- There was something unusual with the sales update of Unilever, Hindustan Unilever’s parent, which on December 17 cut its sales growth outlook for 2019. As the year draws to a close, this comes as a surprise for investors, pulling down both the stocks.The company’s earlier sales guidance was at the lower end of its 3-5 percent multi-year range. It now believes that sales for 2019 would come in even lower. Not just this, the FMCG player doesn’t expect a swift recovery. While it expects H1 of 2020 to be better, growth is still expected to be below 3 percent. A recovery is expected in H2 2020, which could take the full-year guidance to the lower end of the 3-5 percent multi-year range.Unilever has cited economic challenges in South Asia and tough trading conditions in West Africa as the key factors behind the downgrade. Though the trading environment in developed markets continues to be challenging, there are early signs of the tide turning in North America.Interestingly, the underlying sales growth for the nine months to September stood at 3.4 percent whereas the figure for Q3 2019 read 2.9 percent. The trajectory implies that growth has decelerated further in Q4 compared to Q3, leading to the drop in full-year sales guidance.India – Key contributor to sales moderationNoneSource: Unilever, HULEmerging markets (EMs) excluding Latin America contribute about 46 percent to Unilever’s sales. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that HUL’s top line contribution to the EM segment is about 15 percent. In other words, HUL roughly contributes close to 7 percent of Unilever’s sales. When we look at the quarterly sales performance for the past eight quarters, it becomes clear that a large part of the deceleration in the EM space may be actually due to the demand slowdown in India.In the quarter gone by, HUL’s sales slowdown reflects lower offtake in rural areas. Rural demand, whose growth was around 1.3 times that of urban areas in early part of FY19, is now just 0.5 times.ImplicationsLet’s join the dots further. Given HUL’s share in Unilever’s growth sweepstakes and the peer commentary, the industry is not expecting a quick recovery. There could be a gestation of 3-4 quarters before volume growth recovers up to a low double digit.So, we take a contrarian point of view that HUL need not pursue any aggressive pricing-led strategy in coming quarters, except for the pockets where downtrading is visible (soaps and toothpaste).Post weak guidance from Unilever, we have marked down our estimates for FY21, due to which the stock now trades at a multiple of 55x FY21 estimated earnings. While it has corrected by about 12 percent from its all-time high, further consolidation is not ruled out in the near future. However, we remain positive on the stock for the medium term and see it as the most well positioned FMCG candidate to ride out the current slowdown phase.We are also of the view that the company will further raise its market share while posting volume growth ahead of the industry on the back of better channel liquidity and supply chain management.Also, rural demand is likely to improve on better outlook for Rabi season. We see the FMCG major to be ahead of the pack in capturing this incremental demand. The stock can be accumulated on declines.Follow @anubhavsaysNone"

title,Is Rs 3.6 crore enough for your retirement? Here's what a StanChart survey reveals

content,"NoneThe report examined the saving and investment habits of 10,000 emerging affluent, affluent and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) across 10 fast-growing economies: China, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the UAE. The key finding across countries was that people’s aspirations outstrip their ‘wealth expectancy’, or their total net wealth at age 60.In India, the report found that almost one-third participants (32 percent) are on track to achieving more than half of their wealth goal at age 60. But all is not lost for the remaining. StanChart feels it is still possible to narrow the gap with well-defined goals and a considered wealth management approach.According to the report, the average wealth expectancy in India for those in India with enough disposable income to save and invest is Rs 3.6 crore: Rs 1.3 crore for the emerging affluent, Rs 2.6 crore for the affluent and Rs 6.9 crore for HNIs.This translates into an average Rs 93,000 per month to live by on during retirement, which is less than both their current income and wealth aspiration.What's disturbing is that if Indians were to spend at the average monthly rate at which they aspire, their wealth expectancy would last the emerging affluent six years of retirement. These figures should be seen in relation to average life expectancy of 23 years post-retirement.Indians are majorly saving for their children's education, funding their own business, investing in property and supporting parents or relatives financially.On wealth planning, three in five Indians (60 percent) have a financial strategy which includes investment products. The financial products that Indians prefer are: savings accounts, mutual funds, and property, the report stated.Despite this, nearly half (49 percent) see themselves far away from their top financial goals. As per the survey, around 64 percent of the affluent group said ""they worry so much about money that it affects their health, and 62 percent of the emerging affluent feel so overwhelmed by financial planning they fail to put a plan in place at all"".Another point of concern raised by Indian savers (62 percent) was how will the next generation manage and preserve the wealth they pass on, despite 80 percent having a comprehensive wealth transfer strategies in place."

description,"The 4K laser projection system will deliver increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the distinct, exotic colors."
content,"NoneHow will IMAX Laser technology make your cinematic experience better?The 4K laser projection system will deliver an increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the distinct, exotic colours.Talking to Moneycontrol, Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Cinemas, said, “We have planned four-screen roll out on the upgrade and three will be in current existing theatres out of which Mumbai and Delhi are in phase I and the third one will be in Chennai and the fourth will be a new project.”He added that PVR will use the 4k laser projectors to experiment with a slightly smaller site to see if they can increase the penetration of the concept of IMAX.While Dutta did not give exact investment details on how much PVR has invested to bring the IMAX Laser technology, as IMAX is selling the technology to other players as well, he did say it is double the cost of the Xenon deal.“Our last Xenon deal was close to about Rs 8.5 crore to Rs nine crore for entire IMAX. It is typically double of that and this includes seating, signage and the works that come with it,” he said.While IMAX’s Laser doesn’t come cheap, PVR is not charging a premium on the tickets for the new technology.“It (ticket prices) will be marginally higher than what is charged for IMAX screens, probably Rs 25 higher.""Getting IMAX Laser is another tech addition in PVR’s portfolio and also in its premium segment. But what makes PVR confident about such formats?“If we look at the premium screen, out of the 821 screens we have, close to 94 sites are premium screens which include Luxe, Gold Class, Director’s cut, IMAX, 4DX, Playhouse, the Samsung Onyx LED screen, D-Box. And we believe that this is important because we have to start giving audiences a much bigger reason to get to the cinema. Experiences that are difficult to replicate,” said Dutta.“If we track them (premium PVR formats) against the other auditoriums within the complex, all these formats perform at least 10 percent higher occupancy than the other auditoriums. Formats like 4DX and Playhouse are up 25 percent in terms of occupancy and with similar content playing in the other auditorium within the complex. All these formats are successful because consumers are willing to pay extra. The profitability is also higher,” he said.With movie consumption seeing significant growth in 2019, scaling of premium cinema formats by film exhibitors is the right move.PVR saw footfalls growing to 29.3 million in the September quarter from 23.1 million in June quarter.""It is clearly showing that this category (film exhibition) has the power to reverse the recessionary trends,"" said Dutta."

content,"- Drug regulator National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has hiked the ceiling prices of 21 drugs by 50 percent in exercise of powers under para 19 of the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), 2013. This is the first time ever that the said provision has been used to raise prices.Why did the regulator act? Simple. To make the medicines available as companies faced a rise in prices of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), a major raw material. In fact, supply of some of the medicines turned thinner.Pharma companies have been pitching for increase in prices for the past two years. The pricey input was a result of adverse developments in China where many API units had to shut down because of an anti-pollution drive, leading to sharp demand supply imbalance. Even those units which have been able to restart operations come with a higher operating cost linked to environmental compliance.All this has led to a sharp increase in API prices over the last couple of years. As nearly 68 percent of bulk drugs/intermediates imported to India comes from China, this has become a lingering issue for domestic formulators. Furthermore, price caps for relevant drug formulations had made production unviable.We list out key beneficiaries of this regulatory action and what it means for the overall sector.Table: Ceiling prices increased for following drugsNoneSource: Companies, Moneycontrol ResearchKey observationsTo be sure, this situation of supply shortage is not specific to India. Globally, key cardiac drug - Furosemide - was apparently discontinued by major players such as Mylan, Hikma, Teva and Sandoz. Merck anticipates supply demand imbalance for BCG drug (BCG Live Intravesical). Ascorbic Acid Injection from Mylan is reportedly not available.NoneThe story is more or less the same for Penicillin G Benzathine, a key drug used for treatment of rheumatic heart disease and syphilis, which is in shortage. Globally, a select few firms make the API for Penicillin G Benzathine, most of which are in China. Austria-based Sandoz too is a key player in this space.NoneNoneIn the September quarter, life science chemicals witnessed a sales decline of 8 percent YoY though profitability improved. This means Atul industries can possibly execute further improvement in margins on this front.TakeawaysNoneNoneIn short, the price increase helps in moderating the regulatory risk for the domestic pharma. The NPPA has a tricky job at hand. It has to ensure that overreliance on affordability does not takeaway accessibility or force patients to choose for costlier alternatives.The sector has been grappling with adverse regulatory actions in the past and sourcing challenges for KSM (key starting materials) and APIs from China.Recent domestic pharma industry data for November also augurs well for the sector. November sales growth of 14.5 percent has come with a healthy mix of volume, price and new launches.In a nutshell, the domestic pharma industry should be a close watch for investors in days to come.Follow @anubhavsaysNone"

datetime,2019-12-24 15:28:00+00:00
description,"Given the low credit-risk associated with these bonds, many investors with modest risk appetites took to these schemes"
content,"Banking and PSU bond (BPSU) schemes have been among the best in the debt funds category during the last one year. Most of these funds have done well despite turbulence in many other categories of debt funds due to the IL&FS and DHFL crises, and other troubles confronting the segment.The assets under management rose to Rs 66075 crore as of November this year, up from Rs 35682 crore on April 30, 2019 – an increase of 85 per cent. BPSU funds, as a category, have delivered 9.88 per cent returns in the last one year, equalling what gilt funds gave, according to data from Value Research. But are these schemes as safe as they are made out to be?Take the case of the UTI Banking and PSU Debt (UTIBP) fund. This fund lost one per cent over the past one year, even as most schemes in the category scored well.So, here is how you should navigate this category and avoid any potential landmines.NoneWhy Banking and PSU debt funds?Given all the negativity around the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) space, liquidity crunch and news of firms defaulting on interest and principal repayments, safety was paramount on investors’ minds.NoneSays Devang Shah, deputy head-fixed income, Axis Mutual Fund, “A cut in policy rates and infusion of liquidity in the banking system by the Reserve Bank of India ensured that the bond yields on three-year AAA rated papers fall to approximately 6.5 per cent from 8.5 per cent a year ago. Most of the banking and PSU bond schemes were invested in two or three-year bonds and hence investors have seen good returns in these schemes.” The past one year’s returns are a combination of the interest earned from bonds held and capital appreciation. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice versa.What went wrong with UTI BPSU?The scheme had 9 per cent of its corpus invested in Jorhat Shillong Expressway (JSEL) – a special purpose vehicle of IL&FS. After the downgrade in the credit rating, the fund house provided for the same by reducing the net asset value of the scheme.“The investment was done bases on the ring-fenced structure and cash-flows coming from National Highway Authority of India – a AAA rated PSU. However, subsequent moratorium on repayments imposed by National Company Law Appellant Tribunal on the IL&FS group also hit the group companies including JSEL and stopped the repayments of loans. That has in turn hit the scheme. Clarity will emerge after final decision is taken by authorities concerned,” said Sudhir Agrawal, fund manager – fixed income, UTI AMC.Though experts point to the lack of clarity on the interpretation of the law, the fact is investors are sitting on losses.This incident underlines the need for checking the portfolios of schemes before investing. The fund manager is allowed to invest up to 20 per cent of the scheme’s corpus in bonds not issued by banks and PSUs. Fund managers may invest in low-rated papers to boost the returns of the portfolio and so risks may creep in.Should you invest?“If you are planning to invest in these schemes just because they delivered very good returns in the recent past, then it is a bad idea,” says Feroze Azeez, deputy CEO, Anand Rathi Private Wealth Management. You should instead focus on the yield to maturity of the scheme when you are planning to invest in a bond fund, he says. If we go by average yield of 6.8 per cent and average net expense of 60 basis points, then the net yield works out to 6.2 per cent. This is in line with one and three-year fixed deposits offered by nationalised banks – not attractive, if we keep aside the tax treatment of the returns.Though these schemes invest mostly in short to medium-term bonds maturing in two to three years, if the interest rates move up, these funds may be hit if yields move too quickly."

content,"Rusan Pharma, the drug maker that specialises in narcotics and psychotropic drugs, is planning to become an end-to-end value chain company in controlled substancesRusan has set an ambitious target of clocking sales worth Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years.The Mumbai-based company wants to be involved right from cultivation of poppy to extraction of opium-based alkaloids for making drugs and also plans to set-up clinics for treating de-addiction.Opium productionRusan was one of the two companies to be awarded a licence by the Indian government for the trial cultivation of poppy and extraction of opium from it through a new technology that improves the crop yield and efficient extraction of alkaloids.In October 2017, an area of two hectares was allocated to Rusan Pharma and Embio in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.The government currently allows limited cultivation of poppy in notified tracts in these three states under tight controls for medical and scientific purposes.The government is taking steps to privatise opium cultivation, in order to increase opium production and modernise the British old opium alkaloid extraction process. Along with domestic consumption for medications and scientific purposes, the government also intends to make India into an export hub for opioids. For instance, the palliative care coverage of morphine is just 1 percent.India is one of the few countries that grows opium legally and produces opium gum. The produce is taken to Government Opium and Alkaloid Works (GOAW) in Ghazipur (Uttar Pradesh) and Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh), where opium is dried for export and alkaloids are extracted to be sold to pharmaceutical companies.Pharmaceutical companies such as Rusan process the alkaloids such as morphine, codeine, oripavine and thebaine into drugs to treat addiction from alchohol and medicines to treat extreme pain.NoneSaxena said that the government wants industry to develop technology that enables to extract many alkaloids in opium. He said there are about more than 14 plus alkaloids that have medicinal use.Vertical integration""If they accept our results and find it considerable and important, they will hopefully give licence for a period of 24 years for a pharma company, which we hope we could get one. We estimate the would allow to cultivate in about 8000 to 11,000 actors in these three states, so then we become one of the few companies or if not only company in India to be integrated right from the crop to the bupronophine patch and to the patient through our Navi Care (out-patient de-addiction centres).Rusan expects to end FY20 with sales of Rs 300 crore. The company is hoping to double the sales in next 2-3 years with the help of filings in high-regulated markets like Europe and Canada, scale-up of apomorphine hydrochloride injection for Parkinson's Disease, launch of over-the-counter nutraceuticals, and Navi Care OPD de-addiction centres.The company currently gets 50 percent of revenues from exports, and remaining from domestic market. It makes about three-fourths of revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and the remaining from formulations.Rusan was founded by scientist-turned-entrepreneur Navin Saxena in 1994. Saxena was earlier head of research and development at Unichem Laboratories."

description,The company is looking to launch its first mass-market electric vehicle within the next three years
content,"Gauging the positive response that Hyundai has received for the Kona and the strategic push at the global level, the Korean heavyweight will likely expedite rollout of electric vehicles (EVs) for the Indian market.The company is looking to launch its first mass-market electric vehicle within the next three years, whose platform will lay the foundation for wider acceptability of such vehicles in India. Hyundai is expected to pump in around $200 million for developing the EV platform.Launched in August, the battery-powered sports utility vehicle (SUV) -- Kona -- became an instant hit, with Hyundai reporting a stock-out for 2019. This is despite the model’s steep price tag of Rs 25 lakh. The Kona’s buyers include a state-owned company besides regular private buyers.Hyundai believes that by 2030 a major chunk of the Indian four-wheeler market will be electrified and thus more affordable EV models will have to be launched.NoneAs for Hyundai, more than 300 units of the Kona have been booked in India.“Electrification will be a major factor of our long-term strategy not only for HMI (Hyundai Motor India) but also for HMC (Hyundai Motor Corporation). Regional and local implementation will be different depending on each country specific situation. In the case of India, where the government, very strongly, is pushing for electrification of auto sector, we think that by 2030 electrification of four-wheelers will be much more prevalent,” said SS Kim, Managing Director and CEO, HMI, in an interview with Moneycontrol on the sidelines of unveiling the Aura sedan.The Korean giant, which partly owns Kia Motors, unveiled 'Strategy 2025' on December 4, outlining the roadmap to transition into smart mobility solution provider. The second largest carmaker in India will go electric for most of its new models by 2035 in India.“In the short term, there will be lots of hurdles like charging station, customer’s hesitance and taxation. If technology improves in future, there will be reduced cost of the battery and it will help us offer reasonable solutions. In our electrification strategy, India plays an important part,” Kim added.This is the first major development by Hyundai after it made its Indian subsidiary a regional headquarter. The company has only two other such headquarters in the US and Europe. Product planning, sales, marketing, finance and customer approach is defined by the regional headquarters independent of the mother company in Seoul, Korea."

content,"The bull run in 2019 might go down as one of the most ""hated"" rallies as only a handful of stocks attracted the smart money.The Indian equity market scaled new peaks in 2019 surging about 13 percent. However, the rally was primarily inspired by a few frontliners. These select heavyweights attracted a lot of attention from fund managers or boutique wealth management firms raking in big money from the ultra-rich in 2019.About 13 stocks emerged as favourites among Portfolio Management Schemes (PMSes) as more than 10 funds included them in their portfolio, data from PMS Bazaar, an online portal used for PMS comparison, investment and analytics, showed.NoneExperts say the smart money is going in quality stocks or the ones which are displaying growth potential.“The market has become very narrow where most of the money moved into top-quality stocks, especially the leader of a particular sector, because despite the slowdown in the economy these top 10-15 stocks manage to continue with their strong earnings,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.NoneNoneNote: The above list is for reference and not buy or sell ideasPortfolio Management Schemes (PMSes) cater to wealthy investors with portfolio sizes exceeding Rs 50 lakh. The professional fee charged by them is slightly higher than regular mutual funds (MFs).NoneThe schemes which have delivered maximum returns in the last one year are from the multi-cap category. Multi-Cap category funds are more diversified and include stocks from various market-cap baskets. A typical multi-cap portfolio comprises of stocks from large-cap, midcap, and smallcap space.IIFL Multicap PMS scheme generated maximum wealth or return for ultra-rich in the one-year period starting from November 2018-November 2019. It recorded 27.76 percent return under the 1-year category, which exceeds returns across all categories, data from PMSBazaar.com showed.Indian equities after a sharp rally during 2013-17 have largely been in a consolidation mode over the last two calendar years, and much of the consolidation was seen in the small & midcap space.Experts feel that 2020 could be a year when we could see a catch-up rally in many of the small & midcap names as earnings start to look better with recovery in the Indian economy, so the multi-cap category could do well in the next 12 months.“There could be earnings and valuation upgrade going ahead as nominal growth is expected to revive from lows which should aid both top-line and bottom-line growth,” Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss professional Investor Research told Moneycontrol.“2019 was characterized by a Broad-based slowdown in the domestic economy, tight credit conditions, escalating global trade war and muted global growth.

description,"In the new product, the water recovery or the amount of water converted to purified water has been enhanced to 50 percent from the earlier 25 percent. The rest of the water goes back to the water source in the building."
content,"Even as water purifier makers hope for a reversal in the ban on products using reverse osmosis (RO), Kent RO has launched a ‘zero water-wastage’ purifier.The new product pumps non-purified portion back to the overhead water tank, but will not waste water, unlike the traditional ones.This is the first such product in the Indian market. Water shortage and wastage has been a major cause of concern in the country especially in rain-deficient parts such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Mahesh Gupta, Chairman Kent RO Systems said that they simply modified the existing product. He added that consumers can replace their existing Kent RO for the new ones.“Individuals will only have to pay Rs 1,500 for the new pipe to be connected to the overhead tank. The technology will enable us to convert all Kent ROs to no-waste purifiers,” he added.In the new product, water recovery (amount of water converted to purified water) has been enhanced to 50 percent from the earlier 25 percent. The remaining water goes back to the water source in the building.Why RO ban?In May 2019, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to frame rules for the use of RO filters and banned the use of RO purifiers in locations where total dissolved solids (TDS) was low.According to NGT, RO purifiers lead to the wastage of almost 70-80 percent water during the purification process. It asked RO manufacturers to ensure recovery of about 75 percent of the water.TDS refer to the salt, minerals and other solids present in water. RO purification is used to purify the water.However in early November, NGT found that its order was still not being implemented. Following this, the Water Quality India Association moved the Supreme Court to seek a stay on the RO ban. However, the apex court refused to give a stay.NGT has given time till December 31 to MoEF to frame relevant rules. At present, the RO industry consists of Rs 1,000 crore household market and about Rs 1,500 crore of commercial businesses.The Kent RO shiftThe conventional RO water purifiers have a recovery rate of 4:1, that is four glasses of water will give one glass of pure water. But, the new technology pf Kent RO has boosted recovery rate to 50 percent, i.e. 4:2, which implies that four glasses of water will produce two glasses of drinkable water.The remaining two glasses will further be recycled and filtered to make it drinkable. Gupta said that this is achieved through patented processes which involve advanced filtration procedure as well as use of most efficient RO membranes.Going forward, he added that the company will also be open to sharing this technology with other players in the market so that less water is wasted and consumers are able to get good quality drinking water.A recent report by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) based on samples tests conducted on tap water of 21 cities has cities alarming test findings. Among cities, 15 out of 21 were unsuccessful at meeting one or more safety parameter.Moreover, cities such as Chandigarh, Gandhinagar, Patna, Bengaluru, Jammu, Lucknow, Chennai and Dehradun ranked among the cities where the tap water quality is below average.The national capital too where samples were taken from 11 different locations failed to meet the requirements on a maximum of 19 parameters."

content,"Pradeep Joshi was given an annual salary hike of Rs 60,000 in FY20. However, after deducting the increase in his house rent and monthly grocery expenses, the real increment was negligible. While on paper his hike looked decent, there was no real impact of the compensation increase.With a rise in inflation even as salary hikes stay muted, the real wage hikes will be negligible in 2020.In November, India's retail inflation rose to a three-year high of 5.54 percent on the back of rise in food prices. Food inflation rose to 10.01 percent and vegetable inflation jumped to 35.99 percent as compared to 26.1 percent in October.Similarly, medical inflation in India has also been at around 20 percent and is seeing a steady increase. So, even a standard 10 percent hike will translate to very little in terms of an increase in the actual disposable income.""Real wage hike will be less than 5 percent because inflation adjustments are not done.  But this will stay more or less constant,"" said Sunil Goel, Managing Director, GlobalHunt.NoneA recent study by Korn Ferry showed that while the 2020 projected salary increase would be 9.2 percent in India, the inflation-adjusted pay will be 5 percent. However, the study did mention that this is among the highest globally.Companies are cutting down on the fixed component of the salary and are instead focussing on raising the variable component. This variable pay is subject to how well an individual has performed as well as how profitable the company is.""Given the current economic conditions, even a 9 percent salary hike would be considered exceptional. Due to the cost constraints, inflation-adjusted hikes are not viable in India,"" said the head of human resources at a financial services firm.Unlike other mature markets, India has a policy of yearly salary hikes based on performance in the previous year.

title,How to buy sovereign gold bonds from the exchanges
datetime,2019-12-20 09:00:00+00:00
description,Traded volumes are low and the price at which they trade are typically at a discount to the prevailing price of gold
content,"Gold has been the best performer among all asset classes for the year 2019, and there is an expectation that the yellow metal’s prices would continue their journey upward. No wonder then that investors are getting interested in gold.One way to invest in gold is to buy sovereign gold bonds (SGB). However, these bonds are not issued all through the year. If you missed applying for the bonds in the public issue, you can also consider buying these from the secondary market. Here is how to go about it.Tracking the bondsNoneThese bonds are expected to track the price of one gram gold. However, liquidity is very low. Traded volumes are low and the price at which they trade are typically at a discount to the prevailing price of gold. For example, the Mumbai spot 24K gold price for a gram was Rs 3854, whereas the SGBs traded at around Rs 3600 per bond on December 13, 2019.These bonds have been trading at a discount to spot prices all these years and you too will get it at a discount. But there are two implications of such a purchase. First, if you are keen to buy large quantities in a single trade, the price will go up substantially as there aren’t many sell orders. Low volumes mean the maximum quantity traded is around 100 to 200 bonds in a couple of series, while many are not traded at all. So, you need to go slow while placing orders and accumulating these bonds.Second, if you cannot hold the bond till the maturity, you may have to sell it at a discount if there is not much trading interest in the SGB at the time of your sale. Be prepared for such an outcome. If not, hold on to these bonds till maturity.The bonds come with a tenure of eight years. However, they can be encashed or redeemed after five years on interest payment dates.There are many series of SGBs available. A few of them are traded. They mature from 2023 to 2027. Check if you can get a bond that is maturing over your desired holding period. You can ascertain the date of maturity of the bond from the exchange."

title,"Banks and fintech wrap 2019: Repo-linked loans, PSB mergers, digital payment boom and PMC Bank crisis"
datetime,2019-12-20 12:03:00+00:00
description,"With loans being linked with repo-rate, when interest rates decline, your loan rate will also decrease correspondingly"
content,"There were a whole host of regulatory changes in the retail banking and fintech spaces that benefited consumers during the year. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) made loan pricing more transparent by linking interest charged to the repo rate as an external benchmark. The Central Bank also set up banking ombudsman scheme for digital transactions and unified payments interface (UPI) platforms. Here are some of the key happenings in 2019.NoneRetail loans linked to repo-rateThe key reform, which would benefit borrowers, was the RBI’s announcement that, effective October 1, all banks should adopt an external benchmark for pricing their floating interest rate loans. This move brings in more transparency; now banks are slowly passing on lower rates, something that experts say wasn’t happening earlier. Earlier, home, auto and personal loans were benchmarked to an internal rate that banks fixed (based on their marginal cost of funds) that included a margin, which is also determined by the lenders.With loans being linked with repo-rate, when interest rates decline, your loan rate will also decrease correspondingly. It also allowed banks to charge a credit-risk premium over external benchmarks for calculating the effective interest rate. In a recent interview to Moneycontrol, Virendra Sethi, Head of Retail Banking and Mortgage at Bank of Baroda said, “This is the best time to switch from marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) to repo rate-linked home loans since there is a difference of 20 basis points in MCLR and repo rate-linked loans offered by most banks. After switching to repo rate-linked loans, borrowers will save on their equated monthly instalments (EMIs).”The PMC bank crisis In September, the RBI revealed that it had taken over the operation of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank). The bank’s management was superseded and the board was dissolved by the RBI, causing panic among depositors and account holders. This happened because the RBI found irregularities in lending and reporting of non-performing assets by this co-operative bank. An investigation is currently going on.  However, the RBI took some important steps to safeguard the interest of depositors.PMC Bank has been barred from carrying out a majority of its routine business transactions for six months. The restrictions, which apply to both lending and withdrawal, meant that a customer was allowed to withdraw Rs 1,000 once over the entire six-month period from his/her savings or current account or any other deposit account. Gradually, over the next few weeks, the RBI increased the withdrawal limit to Rs 50,000, once over the entire six-month period. The central bank has allowed withdrawals of up to Rs 1 lakh for expenses related to marriage, medical emergencies and education.However, depositors still remain worried about the likelihood and the timeline for recovering their money. A retail banker, requesting anonymity, said, “After completion of six months, RBI will decide whether to relax further restrictions on withdrawal or extend the period based on the outcome of the inspection. If the discrepancies found can be corrected over the course of time, by sale of assets or other measures, the bank's functions will be reinstated.” In case the RBI decides on complete closure of the banking operations, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) will swing into action and customers will be eligible to claim up to Rs 1 lakh of their deposits with the bank.Mega merger of public sector banksIf you are a customer of Corporation Bank, Canara Bank or Andhra Bank, then 2020 will bring in big changes for you, as the three entities merge. In August, the finance minister announced mega bank mergers. This consolidation will bring down the total number of PSBs in the country to 12 from 27 in 2017. The government has announced merger of weaker banks with stronger ones, which will protect the interest of depositors and shareholders.Khushroo Panthaky, Director at Grant Thornton Advisory says, “Technology is a prime consideration in a banking consolidation and therefore these mergers have been decided considering the technology platforms of the banks. The merged entity would have a much better geographical reach. This would enable penetration and improved financial inclusion.”There is likely to be a certain amount of branch rationalisation, as more than one merging entity may have branches in the vicinity. There may be disruption of locker facilities, as also some ATMs being reshuffled etc. On the brighter side, for customers, the shared infrastructure will come as a big plus. For instance, there will be no cross-bank ATM usage fees among the merged banks.Banking ombudsman scheme for digital transactionsDigital payments in general have picked up, aided by large technology companies entering the fray. There has been solid growth in the volume and value of mobile wallet transactions in the last three years. According to the RBI,  as of March 2019, mobile wallet transactions (in volume terms) stood at 414.2 crore, nearly six times more than the March 2016 figure of 60.4 crore. In value terms, as of March 2019, it stood at Rs 1.83 lakh crore, nearly nine times higher than the March 2016 figure.Mobile payment applications such as Google Pay, PhonePe and Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) using the UPI are also becoming popular among consumers. Transactions through the UPI in value terms were at an all-time high in October 2019. They crossed Rs 1.91 lakh crore in value.Vikram Babbar, Partner and Financial Services Lead, Forensic & Integrity Services, EY says, “Increased scale of digital transactions has led to a steady increase in customer complaints – a proportion of which is also related to fraud and misconduct.” So, to resolve customer grievances, the RBI launched the ombudsman scheme for digital transactions in January. An individual can file a complaint with the digital ombudsman if the issuer does not reply within 30 days of raising a complaint, rejects the complaint or does not provide a satisfactory response.In October, the RBI also directed large pre-paid instrument (PPI) issuers such as Paytm, Mobikwik, Zeta India, PayU, PhonePe and Amazon Pay to set up an internal ombudsman mechanism to address customers' grievances. Most of the large PPIs would have an internal redressal system, but now they will have a formal body as per the regulator’s directions.Akshat Saxena, Co-Founder of digital payment solution firm ePayLater says, “An effective mechanism towards resolution of complaints will go a long way in building confidence amongst customers, and will aid adoption of digital transactions across the board. At the same time, it would reinforce the need to deliver the highest quality of service amongst service providers.”Promotes online paymentsFrom January 2020, the RBI has directed banks not to charge savings account holders for online national electronic funds transfer (NEFT).Since July, RBI had already waived off the real time gross settlement system (RTGS) and NEFT processing charges. So, banks were already passing on these benefits to customers. Banks such as SBI and ICICI Bank already waived off RTGS and NEFT charges from July 1 for online transactions."

title,Camel milk brand Aadvik Foods aims to grow at 30-40% in FY20
datetime,2019-12-20 18:22:00+00:00
description,The alternate milk like goat and camel milk is expected to increase to 5 percent of the total dairy consumption in India
content,"The increasing awareness on the benefits of camel milk has led to a steady rise in its demand in India and Rajasthan-based Aadvik Foods, one of the key players in this segment, is betting big on its growth going ahead. The company targets 30-40 percent growth in the current financial year (FY20).In a candid chat with Moneycontrol, Shrey Kumar, Co-Founder, Aadvik Foods said, “We are clocking approx Rs 4.5 crore annually. Target is to increase by 35-40 percent this financial year.”The company intends to more than double its sales in the next two years.Established in 2016 by Hitesh Rathi and Shrey Kumar, Aadvik Foods started its journey by selling just one litre of camel milk. The company now sells 10,000 liters of camel milk a month and in the last three-and-half years it has sold a little over 2 lakh litres milk across the country.Currently, the company receives 150 orders on a daily basis for camel milk and milk-based products.It operates across Delhi, Nokha, Bikaner, and Bhuj offices, while the company’s pasteurization plant is located at Baroda.The company that deals directly with the camel breeders of Rajasthan and Gujarat offers a wide range of products in the camel milk segment such as frozen milk, chocolates, milk powder (plain, banana flavour and chocolate flavour).It also offers camel milk-based skin care products including body butter, soap (six variants) and day cream.Kumar pointed out that the shelf life for frozen camel milk is roughly 45 days, milk powder is 9 months, chocolates is six months, and skin-care products is from 12-24 months.In terms of cost, Aadvik Camel Milk (Frozen) 200 ml pack is priced at Rs 100, a pack of 40 grams camel milk powder is for Rs 360, while Aadvik Camel Milk Chocolates Pack of 3 x 50-gram bars is for Rs 255.Aadvik Foods targets both online and offline platforms for growth and the products are sold on the company's website and via e-commerce sites such as Amazon, Flipkart and eBay and through physical stores.“We are present in stores in Delhi/NCR, Lucknow, Punjab, Chennai and give home deliveries in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi/NCR. Offline is a great market for us because most of the consumers buy from offline stores especially in the FMCG sector,” Kumar said.In the camel milk space, the competitors for Aadvik are Amul, Camel Charisma, Nutra Vita, and As Fresh.Speaking about the customer base for camel milk and camel milk products, Kumar said, “People with diabetes, autism, lactose intolerance, and with a healthy lifestyle for overall body growth and kids are our main customers.”Camel milk contains less lactose than cow’s milk, making it more tolerable for many people with lactose intolerance.The milk contains insulin-like proteins, which may be responsible for its antidiabetic activity. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levelsWhen it comes to calorie, protein, and carb content, camel milk is comparable to whole cow’s milk. However, it’s lower in saturated fat and offers more vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, iron, and potassiumIt’s also a good source of healthy fats, such as long-chain fatty acids, linoleic acid, and unsaturated fatty acids, which may support brain and heart healthKumar said Aadvik plans to launch camel milk sugar-free chocolates and goat milk soaps soon.Dairy MarketAlthough the camel milk market is at a nascent stage, it is expanding fast due to increasing awareness on the benefits of camel milk, Kumar said.Kumar believes alternate milk like that of goat and camel is expected to increase to 5 percent of the total dairy consumption in India.The value of the dairy market in India touched Rs 9.16 lakh crore in 2018 and is expected to more than double to Rs 18.6 lakh crore by 2023.In 2018, the global market for camel dairy products reached a value of  $5.64 billion growing at a CAGR of 3.89 percent during 2011-2018."

title,How 'Narrow and Deep' strategy allows fintech start-ups to deliver services efficiently
datetime,2019-12-19 20:15:00+00:00
description,"Customer lifetime value is, arguably, the most important parameter for identifying the next unicorns."
content,"Tim NicolleGenerating sufficient customer lifetime value is a fundamental issue many emerging and promising companies stumble upon. First, they find that their cost of sale overwhelms the actual profitability of a customer. Then they notice their customers quickly moving elsewhere, either out-growing the service provided or being poached by hungry competitors. And finally, they can find that their addressable market space is simply not big enough – profitability becomes impossible because the profitable niche is not big enough.This is why investors focus on identifying companies that can create adequate customer lifetime value when it comes to their capital funding decisions. Customer lifetime value is, arguably, the most important parameter for identifying the next unicorns or appreciating which of the current flock of unicorns might have the staying power to build a substantial enterprise.Insufficient lifetime customer value appears as the technology vision of the business crashes into market realities. Imagine a well-executed product with a high level of automation entering the market, only to find that there aren't enough people willing to spend enough money to sustain its operations into profitability. This happens either because the cost of sale gets too high or the lack of customer longevity is found to be too short. Some promising businesses find these realities painful to bear.So, what should fintech businesses do if their customer lifetime value is insufficient to scale revenues to the right level? The answer, of course, is identifying and implementing the right strategy to transform the current business model.Most start-ups start with a “narrow and deep” model instead of “wide and shallow”. ‘Narrow’ means that they have a single product whereas ‘deep’ means that their focus on that product is all-encompassing. This allows them to deliver services better, quicker and cheaper than everyone else.A narrow and deep fintech business can quickly build a competitive advantage in the market through its specialization and single-minded focus. This is because, like banks, wide and shallow fintech businesses do something of everything but nothing exceptionally well. But, in case the narrow and deep model runs into trouble and customers don’t stay long enough to contribute to the bottom line, there are two strategies fintech businesses can go for:NoneThe challenge, here, is to ensure that the focus on the original product doesn’t get diverted as it can dilute the brand’s success and value proposition. A failure to be a master of everything can leave the business as an expert in nothing. Expanding into more services also often necessitates additional skill-sets and technological frameworks that are beyond the platform’s core competence.NoneThe Indian fintech market has scaled new heights in the last 10 years, but the journey hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Businesses operating in this space faced major challenges in producing sufficient customer lifetime value for creating a profitable and defensible business. Fintech companies that tried to expand their offerings while failing to build on their core value proposition have experienced disappointment; their new models don’t work out, or they weren’t able to sustain the quality of service delivery. However, those who strictly focussed on the addressable market space of the core product were able to build a profitable business early on.So, then, how do you identify the winners?It is clear that, for a fintech business, it is crucial to focus on retaining customers as much as it is to acquire them in the first place. However, the path to success is one that emphasizes on creating a narrow and deep presence in a core market with a core product, as that demonstrates the ability to forge a sustainable path to profitability without diluting the value proposition.NoneThe author is CEO of PrimaDollar, a UK-based global trade finance fintech."

Thailand, Vietnam and Japan are more involved in bikes, but the next step for sure will be India and China. We have not set a timeline, but we will try to be in India by the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021.”Given its high price, Energica bikes will be considered as lifestyle products in India, much like the luxury cars of Mercedes and BMW. The company does not have any affordable bike range at present.NoneThe company currently sells three bikes – Eva Ribelle, Ego and Eva EsseEsse9 – under two categories: Streetfighter and Race Replica. These are sold in Europe, US, Japan, South Africa and Hong Kong.NoneThe Energica Ego+, for instance, generates peak power of 107kW (145hp) and has a top speed of 240 km/hour. The bike has a city ride range of 400km on a full charge. A slightly lower range version is priced at $22,565 (about Rs 16 lakh).In comparison a petrol powered 800cc Kawasaki Z800 and Ducati Monster 821 clocks a top speed of 233 km and 225 km per hour, respectively. Both bikes are priced in the range on Rs 8-11 lakh.No manufacturer has so far shared any plans of launching high power electric bikes in India. A bunch of startups, however, have evinced interest in launching high power motorcycles. In fact a startup based in Bengaluru Ultraviolette launched a battery-powered race bike F77 at Rs 3 lakh.

title,Immigration aspects foreign nationals coming to work in India must be aware of
datetime,2019-12-18 08:55:00+00:00
description,It is important for a foreign national to comply with tax and social security regulations
content,"Anand DheliaMNCs have always encouraged movement of their key personnel across the world for setting up new ventures and commercial establishments and growing their existing business. At the same time, increasingly, countries are making their immigration rules more stringent. It is therefore very important for MNCs to be fully aware about various immigration requirements while deciding to move some of their key personnel to locations that have business opportunity.Immigration rules in India with respect to foreign nationals have undergone a series of changes over the past couple of years. India’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Labour (MoL) have been closely involved in structuring the foreign policy in this regard, with relevant inputs from the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Information Technology.Immigration rules in India can be complex with extensive documentation requirements and procedures. This article provides an overview of some important considerations that foreign companies need to take note of before a move is planned to India.Visas for foreignersForeign nationals coming to India need to have valid passports and visas. The type of visa to be obtained depends on the purpose and duration of the visit. In order to simplify the visa application process and provide greater flexibility in terms of the activities permitted to be performed in India, the MHA has recently liberalised India’s visa rules by consolidating several categories as well as subcategories of visas.While the revised guidelines are not available in the public domain, changes are evident from the visa application processes being followed by Indian missions abroad for travel to India.As a part of this consolidation and liberalisation exercise, the intern visa has been clubbed with the student visa; the sports visa, with the business visa; and the project visa, with the employment visa. Several sub-categories of visas issued earlier have also been grouped together.Pursuant to this consolidation, foreign nationals can now travel to India by applying for any of the 16 categories of consular visas available, depending upon their purpose of travel to India (this is in addition to the possibility of applying for any of the five categories of electronic visa [e-Visa] issued for travel to India for carrying out specified activities).Once a visa is issued, the foreign national is strictly required to adhere to the purpose of visit declared in the visa application, barring certain exceptions. For example, foreign nationals who are in India on valid visas and are suffering from a minor medical condition which needs OPD treatment or are required to undertake indoor medical treatment for less than 180 days are now permitted to do so without converting their existing visa to a medical visa. Foreign nationals are also generally permitted to carry out tourism activities (allowed under a tourist visa) on the visas held by them while in India.The liberalisation of the visa regime is a welcome move and is yet another step that enhances the ease of doing business in India.NoneOnce the relevant visa is obtained and upon arrival in India, the foreign national may be required to obtain a residence permit from the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) authorities within 14 days (or earlier) of arrival in India based on the stipulation endorsed in the visa stamp. The FRRO provides a series of services, including extending a residence permit/stay visa, applying for a change of location within India and obtaining an exit permit.Most of these services can be availed electronically, which eliminates the need for the foreign national visiting the FRRO office. Online submission of documents and payments also makes it much more convenient for the foreign national.It is also important for the foreign national to carry out related compliances, as may be applicable, under other related legislation such as tax and social security regulations.While the current immigration process provides a user-friendly environment for foreign nationals, there can be several situations which require specific analysis and advice so that the individual as well as the sponsoring entity (employer/vendor/third party, etc.) is compliant from an India immigration perspective. For instance, is a foreign national necessarily required to apply for a residence permit for legitimately staying in India? What should the person do in a situation where the validity of the visa currently held has expired and the application for a visa extension has not been processed? Can the foreign national travel outside India in a situation where a residence permit was not obtained though it was mandated in the visa stamp? Is there any requirement to notify the immigration authorities on completion of employment/assignment in India?Flouting any of these regulations can lead to penal consequences, including deportation in case of serious violations. In the case of an employee, missing out on these regulations could have ramifications for the employer too as the employing entity is, ultimately, the sponsor of the Indian visa under the Indian immigration laws.Since the India immigration regime is constantly evolving, periodic reviews of the guidelines, FAQs and similar information available in the public domain will help in ironing out any creases in the immigration process."

description,"The car was presented after a short introduction and description of the car, which was enough to quell the curiosity and anticipation we had at the beginning."
content,"NoneThe car was presented after a short introduction and description of the car, after which the company offered a chance to take the car for a short spin.Jaguar had created a mini test course in the premises of the mill, allowing drivers to experience a little of everything. From 90-degree corners to a full-fledged slalom test, to a speed run, Jaguar knew what their new launch was capable of.Though the XE is a lengthy sedan, its bulk was hidden well among its curves and edges. Its doors open smoothly and allow entry into an almost isolated cabin. The fully digital driver's display does its job of providing all the necessary information well and the prominent steering wheel gives the driver a firm sense of control. The SportShift Selector slid easily into drive mode and the car was ready for the drive. I was also accompanied by a navigator and instructor to guide me through the course.The XE is equipped with an 8-Speed Electronic Automatic Transmission with Jaguar Sequential Shift, which takes care of everything except letting the car accelerate and brake. Upon accelerating, it drove seamlessly past the start line and reached the first corner in the blink of an eye.The 2-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine which runs the car makes 250BHP of maximum power and 353Nm of peak torque. This provides enough power to offer a smooth yet exhilarating drive. The XE also gets a driver fatigue sensor, which detects the driver’s fatigue and suggests the need for a break.The system uses an internal timer, along with optic sensors and driving style analyses to determine if the driver needs a rest. My navigator told me about the XE’s different driving modes, which alter the power delivery and rpm modulation to offer distinctive yet seamless driving experiences, depending on the selected mode.After completing the first half of the course and going through the slalom, we lined up to the beginning of the speed run. I stepped on the pedal after receiving the green signal and pushed it all the way down, to open the throttle completely.In petrolhead lingo, this phenomenon is called “Pedal to the metal”. The acceleration pushed me back into the seat, letting me feel the power of the engine. Its low-rumbling grunt could not penetrate the soundproof cabin initially, but the engine's noise grew prominent as the revs climbed.The speed run ended and I knew immediately that the XE was not just a luxury car, it was an emotion.Driving the Jaguar XE is a unique experience, as it showed me the difference between going fast, and going fast while looking good."

title,How Pune-based Cilicant is trying to disrupt MNC-dominated pharma desiccant market
datetime,2019-12-18 21:12:00+00:00
description,"In pharmaceuticals, desiccants play an important role in keeping the drugs stable and extending their shelf life."
content,"In early 2011, Manish Jain, founder and managing director of Cilicant, visited a large Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company exporting drugs to the US market. There, he tried to nudge them to buy desiccant pouches made by his small company.Desiccant pouches are little sachets containing silica gel crystals that are used to absorb moisture.Desiccants are widely used in packaging industries like leather goods and electronics, among others. But in pharmaceuticals, these play an important role in keeping the drugs stable and extending their shelf life.Moisture is one of the major reasons behind pills losing the stability or properties/characteristics possessed at the time of their manufacture.In India and some other countries, tablets and capsules come in tightly-packed aluminium blister strips, reducing the scope for moisture seepage.But in the US, medicines are packed in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles. However, HDPE and PET bottles have one major drawback- over a period of time, moisture seeps into these bottles affecting the stability of the drugs. For instance, drugs like statins and thyroxine react to moisture more quickly. So to avoid this, pharma companies use desiccant pouches inside the bottles to protect the drugs from moisture.The pharmaceutical company told Jain that for it to use his desiccant pouches in pill bottles meant for the US market, he needed to make products compliant with USFDA's regulatory standards. Until then, Indian pharma industry would continue buying from two multinationals-- US-based Multisorb and Switzerland-based Clariant Specialty Chemicals. The pharma company executives encouraged Jain to take up the challenge to become the first Indian to manufacture desiccants in line with USFDA standards, and thereby offer competition to the MNCs.Jain didn't lose heart. He started working on sourcing materials like the silica gels, pouches and ink and a factory to produce desiccants compliant with USFDA’s current good manufacturing practices (cGGMP).Desiccants, just like active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), also have to get approval for their drug master file (DMF) from the USFDA.By 2012, Cilicant became the first to get USFDA approval for its desiccant, followed by Health Canada. The next year, it expanded its production capacity by establishing a dedicated facility in Pune for pharmaceutical industry.Jain extended his product pipeline by adding desiccant canisters and oxygen absorbers.Expansion plansCilicant is expected to close FY20 with a turnover of Rs 45 to Rs 48 crore, growing annually at 35 percent to 40 percent.Jain says his company is profitable, generating an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 24 percent and upwards.""Getting large orders is still a challenge, given our small size and pharma companies’ unwillingness to take a chance with a product made by a small Indian company, for their US market,"" Jain said in an interview to Moneycontrol.""To address, this we are expanding our production in a big way,"" Jain added.Cilicant is setting up a new factory in Pune at an estimated investment of Rs 25 crore. The factory is expected to begin operations in first half of next year, tripling the existing capacity.""The market for pharmaceutical desiccants and oxygen absorbers is around Rs 500 crore, we are servicing one-tenth of that market, there is huge potential for us to grow,"" Jain said.Meanwhile, Cilicant is setting its eyes on the Rs 2,500 crore non-pharmaceutical desiccant market. It had helped India's major food company Haldiram, Nagpur, to increase the shelf-life of their famous sweet orange barfi from 15 days to 60 days.Jain says the market for non-pharmaceutical desiccant market is highly unorganised and the industry lacks awareness on the right use of product.""We position ourselves as the solution provider to increase the shelf life of products, rather than only focusing on selling, we work with the customer to understand his needs and customise accordingly,"" Jain said.Jain said he plans to raise around Rs 110 - 120 crore, and has appointed an investment banker. The proceeds will be used for branding and expanding business."

But here there is not much science as everyone knows who are top artists people are listening to. These are high profile, tentpole events that are sponsored. There is another category of events which are data led. These are artists who you wouldn’t know but they have a core subset of 3,000 to 4,000 fans in India who are happy to spend money to watch them live,"" he said."

description,"In the past too the professor was criticised for showing a parody video made by one of her students, which many felt was “derogatory towards women”."
content,"An accounts department professor of the University of Massachusetts was disallowed from taking classes, weeks before semester-end, for showing students an Adolf Hitler parody clip.The school authorities were irked by the teacher’s decision to show “objectionable content” to the students inside the classroom and dismissed her for the rest of the semester.NoneLowry has been teaching at the campus for more than 10 years and used to dole out extra marks to students who would come up with similar parody videos towards the close of every semester, informed her sophomore student Ibrahim Akar.The “Downfall” clip that was showed in class was originally posted on YouTube a decade ago, by one of Lowry’s then students. The English subtitles added to the famous scene from the German movie by the accounts graduate read: “Don’t you dare finish that sentence or I’ll send you to a chamber and it won’t be the chamber of commerce.”The reference made here is obviously to the gas chambers where the Nazis killed millions of Jews during the second world war and several persons present in the November 2019 class found it distasteful.The teacher has since extended an apology to the class via email and vowed to put an end to this unique extra credit system she had introduced. Her letter read: “My intent was never to offend or upset anyone. While I've received hundreds of wonderful, thoughtful, creative videos over the past 11 years, this issue, along with an earlier issue this semester, has caused the end of these extra credit videos.”"

FIIs have been quick at spotting opportunities across sectors such as telecom, finance, healthcare, IT, insurance, FMCG as well as agri stocks.NoneNone“FIIs placed their bets on stocks with a good track record with the hope that these stocks would drive the rally in midcap and smallcaps on the signs of economic andearnings recovery,” Ajit Mishra, VP – Research, Religare Broking Ltd, told Moneycontrol.NoneNoneNone“There is a value play in midcap and smallcap and it's very much stock specific. This space has been down for quite some time and there were stocks that were available at very much cheaper valuations,” Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research, said.“Some of the stocks we are seeing in the list are having consistent business growth in double digits. Having FII investment is one of the key filters investors can use when they filter out stocks based on where the smart money is going but that isn't the case every time.”Before pressing the buy button, investors should also screen stocks based on corporate governance, valuations and growth outlook. Consistent investment by foreign investors could be just one filter to identify the stock, suggest experts.“FIIs raising stake is definitely a good sign but I believe as an investor, one must do their own fundamental analysis before investing in a company. FIIs are very nimble-footed and make their decisions very fast, this quality helps them to spot outperformers very quickly but the pitfall is they are equally quick in selling the stock,” Atish Matlawala, Sr Analyst, SSj Finance & Securities, said.“There are few stocks like Tata Global beverages, Kajaria Ceramics, and AU Small Finance bank on which we have a positive view and believe can give good returns over the medium to long term.”"

content,"With an 11 percent return so far in 2019, the Indian market is trading near record high. However, stocks in the portfolio of market veterans such as Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Dolly Khanna and Ashish Kacholia have mostly given negative returns in the calendar year as of September quarter.It is only a reflection of their portfolio as we have only considered those stocks where these investors had at least 1 percent stake at the end of September quarter.NoneNoneNote: This is not an exhaustive list of companies in which market veterans hold stakes, but an indicative list of companies in which they have more than 1 percent stake. The list is not meant for buy or sell ideas.Chennai-based Dolly and Rajiv Khanna, who invest primarily in mid and smallcaps, also saw negative returns in 2019, data from AceEquity showed.The worst performer in their portfolio was Nocil which plunged 41 percent, followed by Rain Industries (29 percent), and Nilkamal (13 percent).Ashish Kacholia also saw over 70 percent of his portfolio record negative returns so far in 2019.Kacholia holds CHD Developers which plunged 84 percent, followed by Mirc Electronics (75 percent), V2 Retail (66 percent), and Hikal (26 percent).NoneNote: This is not the exhaustive list of companies in which market veterans hold stakes, but an indicative list of companies in which they have more than 1 percent stake. The list is not meant for buy or sell ideas.What should investors do?For the last 2 years, small & midcap stocks have not been performing, and most stocks in the portfolio of veteran investors are from the broader market.Experts do not suggest investors to completely walk the path as taken by veteran players. One probable reason for that is to avoid herd mentality. Also, the risk appetite could be different and so can be the investment horizon.Risk appetite is the foremost thing that one must calculate before investing in stocks. Risk appetite denotes the magnitude of risk an investor can take based on goals and expected returns.Another reason which one should take note of is the herd mentality. Stocks in the veteran’s portfolio is public information and investors should avoid basing their investment decision blindly looking at the portfolio.“This is a fundamental equity investment mistake that can dampen your returns. Investors are often caught in a herd mentality where they end up buying a stock, which everyone is chasing,” Rahul Jain, Head, Personal Wealth Advisory, Edelweiss told Moneycontrol.“Investment decisions based on this mentality has more to do with the behaviour of peers. However, what’s essential is to be rational and invest in a stock after carefully analysing its fundamentals,” he said.Investors should not focus too much on timing the market but remain focused on spending time in the market. It is crucial to see long-term returns of a stock and compare it vis-à-vis its peers and benchmark indices.“Attempts at timing the market can make investors worse off in the long run than riding out the inherent volatility. This is simply because it’s hard to precisely forecast how the market will move in future,” Arun Kumar, Head of Research at FundsIndia.com told Moneycontrol.“Our analysis of stock market data shows that a significant chunk of investor gains over a long period of time is actually the result of only a handful of highest-return days or as we call them, the best days,” he said."

The company had posted losses over the last few quarters, but Gupta is hopeful the third-quarter numbers will be positive.In a freewheeling chat with Moneycontrol, Gupta said, “Affordable housing will help us with growth significantly especially since we have a strong range of products catering to that segment.”For this, Shalimar Paints will be focussing largely on the Southern and Western Zones of the country.“September month was a bit challenging for us in the wake of recent losses, but we are certain to recover that in the later phase,” Gupta said.The company reported a turnover of Rs 123 crore and a net loss of Rs 25 crore for the first six months of this fiscal (April to September).The decorative paints segment is the major growth driver and contributor in terms of revenue for Shalimar Paints.“Within decorative, emulsion is one category which has seen good growth. We took a few initiatives to push the growth in these segments especially the influencer segment and for us, it happens to be the painter community. This has spiked up growth in this segment,” Gupta said.Emulsion is a water-based paint, with vinyl or acrylic resins added to make the finish hardwearing. This results in varying degrees of sheen – generally, the shinier the finish, the tougher the paint. It is largely used for interior walls and ceilings.So far, the festive demand was positive for Shalimar Paints and with Christmas and New Year around the corner, Gupta is expecting this growth trend to continue.On capacity expansion, Gupta said, “With the Nashik plant as our latest addition, we have been able to significantly improve our manufacturing output with a capacity close to 70,000 KL (kilolitres) per annum. With Nasik getting operational we will not be looking at increasing capacity in the near future.”"

content,"Political parties locked horns on several occasions in Delhi throughout 2019, in a desperate bid to establish their supremacy in the national capital, unleashing brisk activities starting with the campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha election.As the Congress fought fiercely to regain ground, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) conceded its popularity, which had peaked in 2015 when it came to power in the city-state, to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Lok Sabha election in May.With the BJP winning all seven parliamentary seats, it seems that Delhi followed the national narrative that drove the parliamentary election.Both AAP and Congress had flirted with each ahead of the election to seal an alliance but could not reach a definite agreement and ultimately fought separately.The year started with AAP campaigning aggressively for full statehood for Delhi, but after the Lok Sabha election defeat a relatively subdued face of the party emerged.""We believe in countering hate with love and negative with positive politics. We are doing the same positive politics in Delhi,"" senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said then.NoneTo realise that target, the party has roped in election strategist Prashant Kishor and his organisation Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC).Its main rival, the BJP, is upbeat riding on the success of the Lok Sabha election in May, and is trying hard to form its government in Delhi after more than two decades.The party, faced with the challenge of countering Kejriwal, is banking on the support of voters of unauthorised colonies, hoping they will back it due to property ownership rights given to the residents in these colonies by the BJP-led government at the Centre.BJP's Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari asserted the move will benefit 40 lakh residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the national capital.""Our credo in 2019 has been positivity. With a positive attitude we won Lok Sabha polls. With the same spirit we will also stage a comeback in Delhi by winning at least 45 seats in assembly elections by dismantling the Arvind Kejriwal regime,"" Tiwari told PTI.Other than citing the “failures” of the Kejriwal government, the BJP is depending on the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sail through the crucial elections, after winning only three seats five years ago.The prime minister's rally at Ramlila Ground on December 22, where he mentioned his government's move to provide property ownership rights in unauthorised colonies and slammed the Kejriwal dispensation on a range of issues including dirty water supply and air pollution, set the tone of BJP's campaign for the polls.NoneIn the run-up to the polls, likely in February, the AAP has claimed achievements in the field of education and health, describing them as the best in the country.The party is likely to repeat some of its Lok Sabha candidates in the assembly polls. It is also trying to find new faces for the constituencies on which its MLAs have been disqualified."

description,Projected tobacco-associated mortality in India is estimated reach 1.5 million by 2020
content,"US President Donald Trump signed a legislation this month to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and raise the federal minimum age of sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years.It is now illegal in the US for a retailer to sell any tobacco product -- including cigarettes, cigars, hookah and e-cigarettes -- to anyone under 21 years of age.The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) said these laws are designed to make tobacco products less accessible and less attractive to the youth.Every day, nearly 2,500 kids smoke their first cigarette and over 400 kids become cigarette daily smokers in the US alone.Status of tobacco control in IndiaMost countries have put restrictions on minimum age for purchasing tobacco products. In India, the sale of tobacco products is prohibited to persons under the age of 18.India also prohibits the sale of tobacco products via vending machines and within 100 yards of any educational institution.In addition, several states ban the sale of single cigarettes and gutka and other forms of smokeless tobacco. Smoking is also banned in public places.NoneIt is unclear what happened to the proposal of setting up a committee.To be sure, even the 18-years age restriction is mere symbolic, as most sellers, who are small vendors, are hardly aware of it. Even if they are aware, chances of them following it is minuscule.The sale of cigarettes, ghutka and beedis goes unabated in India. Consumption of beedis among the economically weaker sections, is worse because they contain three time more nicotine and five times more tar, increasing the risk of cancer among the most vulnerable sections of the society.According to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2016-17 conducted by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai for the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, about 28.6 percent of the Indian population consume tobacco, of which 10.7 percent smoke tobacco, while the remaining use smokeless tobacco like ghutka, kaini and zarda. Studies have found that tobacco consumption is also high in tribal and backward regions of India.Around 90 percent of the people who smoke knew that smoking is not good for their health.It is well-established that tobacco consumption either through smoking or orally, causes various types of cancers and non-communicable diseases such as respiratory. Projected tobacco-associated mortality in India is estimated to be 1.5 million by 2020."

title,Why the Maharashtra-Karnataka border is simmering
datetime,2019-12-30 17:44:00+00:00
description,"The district of Belgaum, claimed by Maharashtra on linguistic basis, is at the core of the dispute between Maharashtra and Karnataka "
content,"On December 29, buses traversing from Kolhapur district of Maharashtra to Karnataka were suspended, reportedly after the Maharashtra State Road Transport Service (MSRTC) received inputs about a possible law and order situation arising out of a dispute between the two states over Belgaum.Consequently, buses from Karnataka to Kolhapur and other districts of Maharashtra were also suspended by the North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation.What happened exactly?The details regarding what exactly happened are a little sketchy, but reports suggest that tensions on the border simmered after certain remarks by a Kannada organisation against the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) led to protests.The MES has been fighting for Belgaum district, which is a part of Karnataka, to be merged with Maharashtra on linguistic basis.On December 28, several Kannada organisations in Belgaum had reportedly burned the effigy of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.This had led to retaliation from Thackeray's party, the Shiv Sena, on December 29, when the party held a rally in Kolhapur— which borders Karnataka— and burned the effigy of Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa. Sena workers had also reportedly stopped the screening of a Kannada movie at Apsara Talkies in Kolhapur city.What is the issue all about? Belgaum, which has a sizeable Marathi population, is claimed by Maharashtra.The district was a part of the Bombay Presidency, and, after Independence, the Belgaum Municipality had reportedly requested that it should be included in the then proposed Samyukta Maharashtra state, to be carved out for Marathi-speaking population.However, as per the State Reorganisation Act of 1956, Belgaum was included in Mysore state (present-day Karnataka). That, however, was reportedly done on the basis of administrative lines, though reports claim that Belgaum has majority Marathi-speaking population which wanted to go with Maharashtra.The dispute has been on ever since. The MES, which had its Mayor in the Belgaum City Corporation in 2005, had even passed a controversial resolution demanding merger of state's Marathi-speaking areas with Maharashtra.How have governments from both states reacted to the recent flare-up? Apart from the suspension of buses (though reports suggest that now the buses are running according to schedule), Yediyurappa has said Thackeray is trying to ""create confusion"" for ""political benefit"".NoneSena and the Belgaum problem NoneIn 1969, for instance, Sena chief, late Bal Thackeray, was imprisoned after a protest by party workers turned violent. The party's workers were trying to stop the convoy of then Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Morarji Desai, to present a petition asking him to stop the merging of Belgaum with Karnataka.The party has time and again raised the issue. After the Sena came to power this time in alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Thackeray appointed Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as co-ordinators to oversee his government's efforts to expedite the case related to the boundary dispute with Karnataka.The case is pending before the Supreme Court for many years."

According to the bank's officials, the cooperative bank had managed to hide irregularities from the regulator during annual inspections.Last year, scams in state-run lenders raised alarms on the quality of governance in these banks.RBI said that banks are being provided with a list of Early Warning Signals (EWS) to firm up fraud detection and take pre-emptive actions.The report said that a significant time-lag was observed between the date of occurrence and detection of the frauds in the financial year 2018-19 and first half of 2019-20.For instance, 97.3 percent of frauds reported in April-September 2019 by value, occurred in previous financial years.RBI said that loan-related frauds constituted 90 percent of all frauds reported in 2018-19 by value and 97 percent in April-September 2019.As on September 2019, frauds worth Rs 71,146 crore involving amounts of more than Rs 1 lakh were reported, as compared to Rs 42,228 crore in the June-ended quarter."

title,How to trade cheaper options? You can consider these 3 modifications while trading
datetime,2019-12-30 09:46:00+00:00
description,Higher premiums are attributed to higher implied volatility and lower premiums are attributed to lower implied volatility.
content,"Shubham AgarwalOne of the most integral part and probably only one subjective factor in the Options premium calculations is the ‘Volatility’.As the rest of the 4 factors used in the calculation of option premium viz.-  Underlying Price, Strike Price, Time to Expiry & Risk-Free Rate of Interest - do not have any different answers.Given the rest of the four known factors and the premium traded in the market, the volatility figure is called ‘Implied Volatility’.Now, since the rest of the 4 factors are already known, any significant change in Premium without any significant change in underlying price and time to expiry can now be attributed to change in the Implied Volatility.Higher premiums are attributed to higher implied volatility and lower premiums are attributed to lower implied volatility.One could wonder why something like that would happen that with the same time to expiry and the same price and strikes, two different points in time have two different premiums.The answer is in the understanding of the reason behind such anomaly, which brings us to the only logical explanation is that the option implied volatility is forward-looking volatility.Modification #1Buy More Sell LessSince options implied volatility is lower — it is not discounting any big move and thereby keeping the premium value lower. Any directional move should be traded with a buy in Option.This would help in two ways - number 1, the move comes around, and the incremental realized volatility would raise the prices of options, and number 2, the sheer direction that would help the option premiums to go up.Modification #2Avoid Net Sell Option StrategiesOptions are often used in combinations, and many times with more sell quantity than buy. This is done to articulate the low directional intensity of the strategy.However, these strategies should not be resorted to in low volatility environment. Simple reason being, Volatility in itself has a mean-reverting characteristic.This means extremely low Volatility (in our case Implied Volatility) cannot sustain for a long time. So just in case we are net sellers of options and the implied volatility were to mean revert and go higher from the lower extreme we would tend to lose.This is especially to be taken care of by the regular sellers of the options (Far off Call & Put Sellers).Modification #3Like we learned that the Implied Volatility is a function of realized volatility, remember the lower extreme could invite a spike in realized volatility too.As the law of nature holds, destruction is what is speedier than construction. So, more often than not we would have a down move associated with rise in volatility.So, third modification is for the trading portfolio that one holds, there should be a hedge protecting against any such violent down move at all times.In times of low volatility, a little bit of tweaking would help in avoiding any mishaps, unless we are trading a predefined model that induces trades accounting for such situations.(The author is CEO & Head of Research at Quantsapp Private Limited.)"

content,"Standalone health insurer Max Bupa has launched a new product that covers robotic surgeries and CyberKnife treatments. This product offers a sum insured of up to Rs 3 crore.Currently, procedures like CyberKnife are not covered by health insurance in India because the industry does not have adequate data on these techniques such as claims data or the success rate. Cyberknife, which is used as a non-invasive radiation treatment for treating different types of tumours and cancers, is also an expensive form of treatment.Max Bupa's product 'Health Premia' will cover laser surgery cover, robotics surgery and CyberKnife surgery with a specific co-payment. Co-pay means the insured will have to pay a certain amount while the insurer will pay the rest.The product  will provide domestic as well as international coverage, including coverage for lifestyle-related ailments like obesity.Weight loss, or bariatric surgery, is a procedure for obesity. Max Bupa's product will cover expenses for medically-prescribed Bariatric surgery after serving a waiting period, considering the BMI is over 35.This product also provides coverage for up-to 19 relationships, with an individual sum insured for everyone and a floater cover that is common to all.Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance said, “With rising personal incomes and changing lifestyle, Indians are spending over 60 percent more overseas on a year-on-year basis. A substantial portion of this spending is on medical expenses for those suffering from critical illnesses. The plan has been designed as a comprehensive health insurance plan for covering healthcare expenses that a regular health insurance plan may not be able to cover.”The health plan covers children from day one, and also provides worldwide maternity cover, and newborn cover without any additional premium."

The IRDAI has found the MIBL in violation of the Motor Insurance Service Provider (MISP) guidelines on various counts, including the one related to empanelment of general insurers.""It (MIBL) carries in its name, the name of the largest and the most popular car manufacturer in the country, that is associated with quality and reliability,"" said the IRDAI order.Therefore, as the leader in the direct insurance broking segment, MIBL is the role model of insurance broking, which other broking companies seek to emulate, it said, and added this places tremendous responsibility on MIBL as it is held as the torch bearer of the broking profession.""ln light of such expectations, MIBL was expected to act diligently and with utmost care and responsibility.""Unfortunately, MIBL failed in complying with the MISP Guidelines which had been created to protect the interest of the policyholders and other stakeholders,"" said the order while imposing Rs 3 crore penalty on the broker.IRDAI said it is in receipt of complaints/ representations from some general insurers stating that they are willing to enter into a service level agreement with MIBL based on transparent and objective criteria.However, despite the insurance company having made many requests to MIBL for empanelling them, MIBL have neither responded nor empanelled them for selling motor insurance policies through their MISP's.On this charge, MIBL in its reply to the Irdai enclosed an affidavit duly authorised stating that the MISP guidelines are being complied with in full.""MIBL in the same letter have furnished names of 13 general insurers on its panel who sell motor insurance policies as against a total of 25 general insurers doing motor insurance business,"" Irdai said.The regulator said MIBL admitted that MISP sponsored by them have offered discount on labour and interior cleaning, thereby inducing the customer and indulging in unfair business practice which restricts the choice of the policyholder to choose the insurer or insurance intermediary.""By denying the facility of cashless claims to the policyholder, when the motor insurance policy is not purchased through MISP's sponsored by MIBL, the MISP is discriminating between policyholders,"" the order said."

title,Suzuki Gixxer 250 Review: A commuter's alternative to the sportier Gixxer SF 250
datetime,2019-12-27 17:55:00+00:00
description,The new naked bike promises  to be every bit as fun and entertaining as the more sport-oriented SF while still allowing for comfort on the daily commute.
content,"The quarter-litre motorcycle segment has been gaining momentum for a while now and in the naked class, KTM and Yamaha were the first ones to bring it into India with the 250 Duke and the FZ25. But there is a new entrant now and it spells good prospects for the segment.NoneLet's start off with the looks first though. The Gixxer 250 is almost identical to its faired sibling, save for the front. Its gets a quirky little LED headlamp unit sort of oval, sort of flat. Then you take away the fairing and the whole bike is the same. The instrument cluster as well as the tank, the seat and the rear tail unit is all taken straight off the SF 250. The tail lamp too is an LED unit and it makes you wonder why the indicators weren't given the same treatment.There also another thing to say about the design. Apart from the Gixxer SF, the naked bike is also identical to the smaller Gixxer 155. While the design is big bike like, it takes away from some premium-ness that comes with the price tag. There are a few differentiators though, like the instrument cluster and the end can design. Also, while the 155 gets a gloss paint scheme, the 250 gets the matte effect.Coming down to performance, the Gixxer 250 gets the SF's powertrain in exactly the same state of tune. The 249cc oil-cooled single makes 26.5 PS of maximum power and 22.6 Nm of peak torque. These numbers are quite impressive when compared to its rival, the Yamaha FZ25. The performance from the engine feels just as smooth on the naked as it did on the SF 250, but we would have been happier with slightly more refinement.What is nice though is that most of the grunt is offered fairly low in the rev band making riding in the city a breeze. It offers just enough pull to escape a pinch but is also just about easygoing enough that it does not scare you. This balance in power is something most people are going to really enjoy. But as exciting it is on the low-end, there are times when the top-end feels a little lacking. Then there is the buttersmooth 6-speed transmission. Shifting through gears whether up or down has a nice tactile feel making sure I didn't miss a single gear.The chassis set up too is exactly like the SF. It offers good balance and rigidity on streets, even in the kind of streets we have in India. The suspension is a little on the stiffer side. So you do tend to feel the bumps on the roads. Braking, somehow, felt lacking. While the overall feel was good, it lacked that initial bite when you just sort of step on the brake. ABS too seemed to come in a little early, too, but it’s a fine pulse and doesn't feel very intrusive.Now, about ergonomics. The Gixxer has a comfortable riding posture. You sit in a fairly upright position, and in a city where this bike will eventually spend most of its time, this is a good thing. The footpegs too are not rear set. However, they are not biased forward either, so it still feels like you're riding a big bike. The seat itself is comfortable and soft, so it offsets the stiff setting of the suspension. However, I do need to mention that extended time on the bike does get a little hard on the rear side, but the seat is big and wide so there is plenty of area to move around.In terms of rideability, the bike is phenomenal. It offers the same amount of fun we had on the older Gixxers as well as the newer, bigger Gixxer SFs. It is extremely flickable, so cutting through traffic is a breeze. The turning radius, on the other hand, is a tad bit large, so if you are stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, it gets a bit tedious to manoeuvre between cars. At higher speeds and faster roads, hitting a corner feels just right. The suspension may be too stiff for the city but in the mountains or maybe even the track, it works like a charm. Mild bumps around a bend, too, couldn't throw me off my line and that impressed me quite a bit."

description,The FinTech space is using new technologies and disruptive approaches to come up with better and innovative products.
content,"FinTechs in India have evolved beyond just accepting payments and from being transactional to ‘transformational and impactful’.Bengaluru-based payment solutions startup Razorpay is a great a case in point. The company’s CEO and Co-Founder Harshil Mathur believes that Indian FinTech firms are setting new standards for financial services in the country.“Today, large number of Indians are not catered to by financial service providers in the country - this is a huge segment that FinTech firms are looking to tap into through their innovations, a majority of which come from startups. The FinTech space has and is using new technologies and disruptive approaches to come up with better and innovative products,” Mathur says.He also adds that there has been a conducive environment in the ecosystem in recent times that fosters innovation. With the introduction of UPI, the NPCI has leveraged the growing presence of mobile phones. This has helped in the reduction of the cost of infrastructure for FinTech ventures significantly. With the smartphone user base expected to expand, the digital banking footprint is projected to grow faster than ever before.“With 2019 having gone in full speed, I can foresee digital transactions in India accelerating at 70 percent CAGR through 2020, contributing to the GDP by 15 percent,” he says.According to Mathur, here are the trends to look for in the Indian Fintech space in 2020:Increased collaboration: Incentivised programs to promote digital payments and greater collaboration between banks and FinTech firms will be beneficial for the digital payment ecosystem.Better Infrastructure: There’s an increasing demand for low cost infrastructure which will ensure prolonged sustainability resulting in more POS terminals accompanied by better and cheaper payment options for merchants.Growth of Neo-banking: Neobanks are taking over the FinTech industry by a storm, on a global level. We see a new player in the market every year whose primary intention is to simplify financial services to a greater extent. The concept enables businesses to simplify, accelerate, and supercharge every aspect of their financial operations - from accepting payments and managing cash flow to reconciling transactions and flexible payouts."

content,"Reeju DattaTrust plays a major role in the future of digital payments. Customers look for credible platforms and brands for a secure and seamless payments experience. For any fintech company, it is essential to address these needs, while building a business model based on innovation, and ensuring regular fine-tuning of infrastructure.For consumers to have faith in the system, in an era when data breaches are frequent, it is imperative to create infrastructure that protects customer data and ensures the safety of their money. This helps build a positive atmosphere for digital payments, gain trust and develop long-lasting consumer relationships.In this article, we will talk about the measures that India’s regulators have taken, as well as the measures that online payment gateways and merchants can take to increase consumer confidence in digital transactions.NoneIn 2019, the RBI announced the removal of charges on NEFT, introduced new systems such as FASTags which could be utilized to pay parking fees and fuel on highways, launched UPI 2.0, and removed Merchant Discount Rates (MDR) on digital payments, among others.Policy framework changes, government initiatives, and industry associations indicate that India will have an improved digital infrastructure and become the fastest economy to adopt digital payments. According to the Global FinTech Adoption Index 2019, India has an 87 percent fintech adoption rate. The wide acceptance of digital payments has opened several avenues for businesses to explore online payment services and solutions.The introduction of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has accelerated the adoption of digital payments in India. According to the RBI, UPI systems handled 874 crore transactions with year on year growth of 263 percent. One of the main advantages of UPI is that the unique identification created protects user credentials such as bank account or card details.NoneA way that cutting edge payment gateway platforms are mitigating this is to partner with multiple banks help reduce the risk of failure in online transactions. In this way, if the server or processes of one bank’s server fails, there is a back-up. By tying up with multiple banks, payment gateways can ensure that online transactions can go through with minimum hassles and failures. Payment gateways can also reduce failures by:NoneNoneNoneNoneRefund processing is complex and form a significant part of online payment activities. Merchants that are able to offer their customers instant refunds, both on online and cash on delivery (COD) payments can help increase both, the loyalty of their customer as well as their confidence in digital payments as a whole.NoneThese three categories comprise the main source of problems with online transactions. Demystifying back-end processes of digital payments is necessary for customers to understand and trust digital payment systems.

The Kia model sees production of 13,000-14,000 units a month from its factory in Andhra, that is equipped to produce 3,00,000 units a year at its peak.Hyundai had earlier announced that it is planning to invest up to Rs 7,000 crore for setting up a new plant. This new plant, which will come up near its existing factories in Chennai, however, will take at least 2-3 years to become operational.Hyundai is banking on a smart balancing act of export and domestic demand for meeting production schedules. The company is the largest exporter of passenger cars from India. In April-November Hyundai recorded 18 percent increase in exports to 132,800 units even as its domestic sales dipped by 8 percent to 339,044 units, according to data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.Hyundai, however, has systematically brought down the exports share from its total output over the years. From a peak of 50 percent export share has come down to 29 percent as of November.Many countries have increased taxes on fully built products which has made exports to those countries uneconomical. Auto companies have thus switched to exporting vehicle kits to such countries from India. Hyundai India exports to 90 countries. The company currently has an annual capacity of 750,000 units which will be hiked to 800,000 units."

content,"The year 2019 turned out to be an eventful one for the Indian stock market.Recession fears and geopolitical concerns kept investors on the back-foot while the corporate tax rate cut and consistent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reliefs helped benchmark indices form new highs.Here are some of the major events that moved the market:Corporate tax rate cutNoneThe rate cut, a long-standing industry demand, was seen as one of the many reliefs for key sectors, including auto and FMCG.The D-Street went berserk post-announcement, as the Sensex climbed jumped over 3,000 points in just two trading sessions.The overhanging sentiment has since remained positive and the benchmark indices have continually scaled new heights.US-China trade tussleThe constant back and forth between the two largest economies in 2019 kept the tensions high on the global front.The trade war also did not bode well for the Indian economy as investors remained cautious in the face of uncertainty.However, the tension has finally fizzled out as both the US and China agreed to sign a preliminary trade deal.PM Modi retained PMOThe return of Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the helm of the world's largest democracy sent the bulls raging as benchmark indices formed new highs before succumbing to profit-taking.The rally began on May 20 after exit polls predicted a victory for PM Modi; the Sensex closed 3.75 percent, or 1,422 points, higher.On the result day, May 23, the market was initially enthused to see the election results falling in line with the exit polls but the sharp rally eventually led to profit-taking as the Sensex ended nearly 300 points lower, falling as much as 1,500 points from its intraday high.NoneFM Sitharaman's maiden Budget came as a dampener for the Street. Among a slew of measures, Sitharaman proposed to increase the surcharge on the HNIs and foreign institutional investors (FIIs).This fueled an FII exodus as they withdrew over Rs 20,000 crore from the Indian equity market between July and mid-August. Sitharaman later decided to withdraw the proposed surcharge on both FPIs and domestic investors. The Sensex plummeted 0.99 percent on Budget day and fell 2.01 percent the following session.RBI reliefDuring the year, the RBI cut interest rates five times in a row, in an attempt to give a renewed push to a slowing economy. As a result, the repo rate stood at 5.15 percent, a nine-year low.The central bank decided to keep the rate unchanged in its last policy meet of the year in an attempt to keep the rising inflation in check.Recession scareIndia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate fell to a six-year low at 4.5 percent in the July-September quarter exposing the country's severe demand crunch.The mood on the D-Street turned sombre as the Sensex fell 0.82 percent following the data's release. The decline in economic growth came on the back of dwindling consumer demand, slowing private investment as well as a global economic slowdown.Auto sale numbersStifled by an unprecedented slowdown, the Indian auto sector witnessed a prolonged slump in 2019.During the April-November period, the industry reported a 16 percent fall in volumes to 15.7 million units, Society of Indian Automotive Manufacturers (SIAM) data showed. Passenger vehicle sales also saw a dip for 11 consecutive months till September, only to rise marginally during the festive season. The carnage was witnessed in the auto stocks as well as the Nifty Auto index slipped more the 11 percent so far.The big bank mergerIn September, the Centre announced it would merge multiple public sector banks (PSBs) and reduce their number from 27 to 12 over the next few years."

Since then, Paytm has evolved as a sophisticated mobile payment application with a recorded 250M+ users in the mere extent of 8 years and a robust capacity of 5000 transactions per second.In 2018, Paytm’s glorious stint became the theme of a case study at Harvard Business School.Google PayGoogle presented its first digital payment app in 2017 founded on NPCI’s UPI platform. Originally branded as Tez, the app was later rebranded as Google Pay. It was an instant hit among the Indian users with 8.5M installations. In a record time of 40 days, 30M transactions were performed.According to Sajith Sivanandan (Managing Director & Business Head) at Google Pay, “The company’s growth has tripled in terms of monthly active users and are at 67M monthly active users as of September 2019.”PhonePePhonePe was engendered by former Flipkart employees Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari in 2015. In August 2016, PhonePe was the 1st Android app providing UPI based user services. In 3 months, the app showed a record-breaking download crossing 10M users. PhonePe also hit the 50M badge on the Google Play store swiftly.A bump on the road was encountered in January 2017 with blockage from ICICI bank and Airtel for violation of NPCI regulations. This resulted in closing operation on Flipkart as well. This legal feat was however resolved in February 2017."

The company remains comfortably placed on liquidity with a consolidated liquidity buffer of Rs 7,978 crore. It entered into facility agreement with various banks to get the ECB loan of $575 million.With GNPA ratio at 1.6 percent, the company has a largely stable asset quality. The fees and commission income had a 66 percent growth.However, Bajaj Finance has 23 percent of the AUM in SME and commercial lending which might face stress in the current economic situation and pressure in this segment can drag the pace of overall AUM growth with pressure on provisioning run rate, Shailendra Kumar feels.Exposure to Karvy will also impact the earning in near term, he said, adding the stock is currently trading at 6x Price to Book on FY21.He said though Bajaj Finance remained a strong franchisee to own for the long term and a good buy on declines, demanding valuation and possible stress in SME and commercial segments will restrict its shot-term performance."

title,Choosing between the VPF and PPF for additional debt investments
datetime,2019-12-30 19:07:00+00:00
description,"Since both VPF (as part of EPF) and PPF have long-term maturity periods, these are best-suited to act as retirement planning tools"
content,"Dev AshishIf you choose to invest additional sums in debt instruments, how do you choose between the VPF (Voluntary Provident Fund) and PPF (Public Provident Fund)?So, even though all of us (or most of us) know that having exposure to equity via mutual funds is advisable for long-term investments, this article simply focuses on the debt side and tries to help pick between PPF and VPF for the long term.The VPF currently offers 8.65 per cent annually, while the PPF offers 7.9 per cent.So, on an as-is basis, the VPF wins over PPF. But would the VPF offers more than the PPF always? An analysis of the historical interest rates shows that the VPF almost always gives higher returns than the PPF. When it comes to returns, VPF is the clear winner.Putting returns in perspectiveBut we should never focus on returns alone. It’s always advisable to assess other aspects and see if there is a product-investor compatibility in terms of achieving the stated goals.Another important aspect is the lock-in or maturity tenure of the product.The VPF (being a part of the EPF) is considered to be of long tenure till your retirement. You can also withdraw on resignation or if you don’t take up employment for two-plus months. But withdrawal on resignation isn’t advisable as it hampers the wealth creation process if you dip into long-term investments frequently. PPF, on the other hand, matures in 15 years.Since both VPF (as part of EPF) and PPF have long-term maturity periods, these are best-suited to act as retirement planning tools.For all practical purposes, you get your (VPF+EPF) corpus only at the time of retirement. This is not a bad thing as it helps keep retirement savings free from other goal obligations. PPF’s maturity may come much earlier than your retirement if the account is opened early in your working life. After 15 years, the full PPF corpus is available tax-free. And even if the PPF is extended beyond 15 years, the withdrawal restrictions are much more lenient.If you have the option of investing in the VPF, then a combination of EPF and VPF can be a better option than choosing PPF over VPF, assuming you are using these for retirement savings. As for the non-salaried individuals and professionals outside the EPF’s scope, it’s a no brainer that PPF is a good option for debt savings for their long-term goals.Investing limitsAnother factor to think about is how much can you invest in either of them yearly?The limit for the PPF is Rs 1.5 lakh per year. The VPF offers a higher limit with its rule of 100 per cent of Basic + DA. But if the employer has a salary structure where the basic is very low and thereby contribution via VPF is also limited, you can invest in the VPF and PPF.You may have noticed that I didn’t discuss about the tax benefits. That’s because both belong to the EEE (Exempt- Exempt- Exempt) category. However, VPF withdrawals are tax-free only if held for more than 5 years.But as we are having a VPF vs PPF debate from a retirement planning perspective, we should not forget the importance of proper asset allocation. You shouldn’t randomly choose between the VPF and PPF just for tax-saving and returns, ignoring the right asset allocation for your financial goals.NoneIf you are saving for retirement and are still several years (atleast a decade or two) away, then to save a corpus large enough to handle inflation in retirement years, you need to have good equity exposure in your retirement portfolio. Just saving for retirement through EPF (and VPF) and PPF may result in an inadequate corpus.How much should you invest for retirement and do you need to increase VPF contributions or go for PPF?Here are some pointers to help you arrive at a conclusion.- Take the help of an investment advisor (or calculate yourself) to find out how much you need to save for retirement.- Choose a suitable asset allocation strategy, say 60 per cent equity and 40 per cent debt.- If you are investing in EPF and it already takes care of 40 per cent of your regular retirement contributions, then your debt investments are complete.- But if EPF contributions don’t amount to 40 per cent, go for VPF to the extent that it helps you maintain your chosen allocation pattern.- If you do not have the EPF / VPF option, utilize the PPF limit of Rs 1.5 lakh and for amounts above that, pick suitable debt funds.- For the equity allocation (60 per cent in this case), invest via SIPs in good equity funds.Depending on the individual’s requirements, various other strategies can be devised to help choose between VPF and PPF."

I had an inclination to start a business very early on. In hindsight, it was a great decision and I haven’t looked back since. I went on to complete my education with a Masters Degree in Finance. After finishing CFA Level 1, I became bored with studying, and jumped into the practical world by joining a start-up brokerage firm.I started trading in the year 2006-07, just before the bull market had peaked. At the time, I didn’t have any experience, so I followed tips given by my friend’s father, and tried to learn on my own as much as possible. Back then, everyone was making money easily by investing in IPOs. I had borrowed money to invest and I was making enough pocket money to keep going.The neighbourhood uncle, who was friend’s dad, was a punter in stocks. He asked me to buy DLF shares in the IPO and I promptly invested. I watched the stock price for about 5 months and I couldn’t have been happier. Although I was able to earn profits with a small capital size, something didn’t make sense. I didn’t think it would be so easy and that everyone that dabbled in stocks would make money so effortlessly.A few months later, the markets imploded. That’s when reality struck and made me realize that it’s not all rosy in the markets, and I had only experienced the surface. The companies that were regarded as the rising stars had gone bankrupt and my neighbourhood uncle, who was heavily invested in stocks, died of a heart attack after suffering major losses.The 2008 financial crisis has had a profound impact on how I perceive things. Instead of being deterred, I became more determined to be a part of this game. I extensively studied the markets, technical analysis, crowd psychology and wanted to be a part of the stock market industry. It was then, that I joined Zerodha, a start-up based in Bangalore. At the time, stockbroking was the most frowned upon profession.Over the years, I worked in stockbroking, proprietary trading at Futures First where I was involved in trading energy products such as Natural Gas & Crude Oil on NYMEX, ICE, CME and traded actively in Indian markets too.Q: What was your earlier trading strategy, and how did you evolve as a trader?NoneOver time, I realized that it is not practically possible to accurately estimate the performance of such companies for various reasons such as the lack of transparency, cooked books, and my lack of bandwidth to do in-depth research. The probability of picking and sticking to a multi-bagger is extremely rare, considering the market conditions.I swiftly shifted my focus to trading after the 2008 financial crisis and focused on momentum for the most part, and on occasion, I would stake my profits for high risk-reward trades. I would often use pyramiding for reversal trades to maximize the potential profits and be willing to risk most of my profits for a bigger gain.Such a strategy is only practical if you have withdrawn some realized profits from the trading account, and still have a surplus profit which can then be used to protect your capital if your leveraged trades go wrong. If your trading income is really important to you, then pyramiding is best avoided. I learned my lesson after getting stopped out on trades which went in my direction but my stop losses were too tight for the fear of losing my capital.Over time, I evolved into a trend-following trader and avoided reversals as the margin of error is too small for highly leveraged trades. In options, 4-legged options strategies such as Iron Condor and Iron butterfly were my favourite.The most under-utilized options strategy among retail investors continues to be the covered call. They are most suitable for traders with reasonable capital so that it can be deployed across various stocks and indices.As on date, I barely get any time to trade as I am busy running the brokerage business at FYERS. I am currently not able to devote any time to trading.Q: What were some of your best and worst trades?NoneSome of my most memorable trades were in gold. I had started trading physical gold for my friends throughout 2010-2012, which gave ample opportunities. Trading in the physical market was quite an experience. In April 2013, when gold crashed overnight like a slam dunk, I was short when the market closed and during the US trading hours, it crashed further. The next day, I was astonished to see that there were no bids in the market from time to time.This was new to me. When inquiring with the bullion dealers as to how they are dealing with the price crash, they were in a bit of a panic. It gave me the confidence to hold on to the short position and it turned out to be a great trade.Another successful trade that comes to mind is the USD/INR breakout in May 2013, right about the time when gold crashed is when the dollar strengthened against INR by around 10 percent in 2 months. I was able to capture a large chunk of that move.Given that the leverage is approximately 50 times for currency futures, it was a big deal for me, although my account size wasn’t big enough to make me a millionaire! It gave me a sense of conviction that I had the ability to catch trends.My worst trades have always been reversal short trades. There is a thin line between ego and determination. It only takes a few seconds to cross over to the other side and become defiant. I learned to be humble if trades go wrong after repeatedly shorting some stocks after the Modi rally. I guess it’s because I had found success shorting in a well-timed manner before.I follow a top-down process to identify trading opportunities by looking for a trend in the larger timeframe, and confirming if the trend is intact in shorter timeframes, and then looking for trade setups. I avoid using too many indicators and like to keep it simple with price and volume information and maybe one or two basic indicators.Too much information can paralyze a trader, and give rise to doubts instead of confidence. I mostly rely on price action and patterns. One needs to learn how to identify the market phases. It will help create different trading strategies accordingly. What works in a bullish market won’t work in a sideways trending market and so on.In the intraday timeframe, the winning ratio has to be high. If you have a very low winning ratio, then transaction costs will add up and eat into your capital even if you manage to break-even on a gross level. Hence, I would play for uneven and often varying risk-reward trades just to maintain a sustainable win ratio.The risk-reward can be low as long as your win ratio is high. I believe this is especially true for intraday traders who take positions in multiple stocks/instruments. You’re not always going to get a big move and might get whipsawed unnecessarily. Successfully avoiding whipsaws and maintaining a decent win ratio is essential to success. Anything above 40 percent is really great.Q: What are your reasons for starting a brokerage firm?NoneWhen we started FYERS, we had set out with the agenda to transform the trading and investing landscape by focusing on technology. We are also among the very few brokers in India that do not indulge in prop-trading activities. This was a conscious decision we took at the very beginning as we wanted to focus on broking rather than trading, so that we can safeguard the interests of our clients and not expose them to the risk of the broker’s MTM.As an active trader, I found that the brokerages in India are severely lagging in technology and customer-friendly services. They also lacked robust trading platforms that I had used as a prop trader. It was almost as if the brokers were 5 to 10 years behind what traders expected of them.I was determined to improve the trading experience for Indian investors and thus, we applied for a broking license with NSE. At first, everybody laughed at the idea as my team and I was very young at the time and nobody had received a broking license at such a young age. For me, there was no looking back as I had gone all-in and there was no backing out no matter what!To everyone’s surprise, we were granted the stockbroking license and a new and promising journey began in late 2015. When we started FYERS, the focus was on 2 main aspects: technology and transparency. Our extremely narrow approach helped us get the patronage of active day traders and by word of mouth referrals, we have been able to build a customer base of 30,000 without any marketing or advertising efforts. Instead of publicity, we put our efforts into building a great product.We were the first brokerage in India to introduce TradingView with drag and drop trading functionality, which makes it super-easy for scalpers and intraday traders."

datetime,2019-12-24 15:35:00+00:00
description,"At your end, ensure that you do not make any wrong declarations while filling up your proposal form"
content,"Private life insurance companies have registered a marginal improvement in their individual death claims payment track record in 2018-19 compared to what it was a year earlier, as per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India's (IRDAI) annual report released recently. The Life Insurance Corporation of India’s (LIC) claims paid ratio – in terms of number of policies – has witnessed a slight dip during the period.Since the core objective of buying a life insurance policy is to ensure dependents’ financial security in case of the policyholder’s death, the claims paid ratio plays a critical role while choosing an insurer. The ratio reveals the number of claims a life insurer has paid out, of the total claims received during the financial year. From a prospective policyholder’s perspective, the higher the ratio, the more dependable the company.The current recordNoneNoneNoneSince the idea of buying online term policies with large sums insured has gained ground in recent years, it is imperative that insurance-seekers scrutinise these ratios closely before taking a call.Number of policies vs benefit amountAccording to insurers, the claims paid ratio in terms of number of policies is a more relevant indicator as it points to the number of customers whose claims have been settled. “On the other hand, one large-value case can skew the benefits paid ratio either way. The customer chooses his/her sum assured basis his/her requirements and human life value (HLV). It helps understand the number of such customers we have settled the claim for,” says Yusuf Pachmariwala, Executive Vice President and Head of Operations, Tata AIA Life Insurance.NoneWhile newer companies tend to register relatively lower ratios due to investigations that some early claims necessitate, most companies have completed at least ten years of operations. A majority of the insurers reported a claim settlement ratio (by policy count) of over 95 per cent, which is considered a healthy number.However, those looking at buying high-value term policies with sums assured of over Rs 1 crore should delve deeper, feel others. “A customer buying a high-value term cover wants information on settlement of larger claims, not the smaller ones. Therefore, for such individuals, the claims paid ratio in terms of benefit amount paid would be a more relevant metric,” says Mahavir Chopra, Director, Health, Life and Strategic Initiatives, Coverfox.com. Relying solely on a higher claim settlement ratio by policy count ignores the possibility of high-value claims being repudiated. You should compare the difference between claims paid ratio by policy count and benefit amount paid. “Those considering high-value term plans can give preference to companies where the gap is narrower,” he adds. For example, this gap is 86 basis points for Aegon Life Insurance, while it is as wide as 10.14 percentage points in case of Shriram Life Insurance. A narrower gap is an indicator of fewer high-value claims being repudiated.On their part, companies need to adopt watertight underwriting practices during policy inception itself, so that the life assured’s dependents do not suffer due to their negligence in future. Underwriting refers to the process of assessing the risk of insuring prospective policyholders. Insurers claim that they have tightened their underwriting processes to weed out fraudulent cases at inception, over the years. Availability of newer data sources for detailed profiling has helped.""Going forward, thanks to the use of analytics and credit bureau data leading to more robust underwriting, the claims settlement ratio will continue to be good. Stringent underwriting will minimise the scope for fraud, resulting in better quality lives being covered,” says Pachmariwala. A provision in the amended Insurance Act, which disallows calling a policy into question after three years of policy issuance, has also played a role in ensuring stricter underwriting processes.None"

Since the Aura is a replacement for the Xcent, here is how the sedan fares against its predecessor.Both compact sedans share a common heritage of being derived from a compact hatchback. While the Aura is based on the Grand i10 Nios, the Xcent was based on the previous generation Grand i10.The Xcent features oversized headlamps and prominent straight lines but the Aura has a streamlined and rounded appearance. Both cars feature chrome and LED aesthetics, though the wide grille, with matte-finished silver on the Aura suits the car well.The Aura borrows its twin-boomerang DRLs and grille from the Euro-spec i10. Though it looks a little overstyled from the side, the rear-end significantly differentiates it from the Xcent.The Xcent has large taillamps flanking the number plate, while the Aura has a sleek set of taillights with sharp creases on the inside. Both cars have almost identical dimensi0ons, though the Aura is 20mm wider and has a 25mm longer wheelbase."

description,"Mis-selling complaints against banks have jumped 92.57 per cent in 2018-19 over the previous year, according to RBI’s annual report"
content,"Preeti Kulkarni & Hiral Thanawala The much-talked about mis-selling menace – specifically, in cases where banks are responsible – finally seems to be getting the attention it deserves from the regulator. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its analysis of complaints handled by Banking Ombudsman offices during 2018-19, stated that mis-selling complaints shot up by over 92.57 per cent in 2018-19, compared to the levels reported last year. The category, which was introduced in July 2017, had a mere 579 complaints being reported in 2017-18, evoking disbelief. In 2018-19, this number has risen sharply to 1,115.NoneFactors contributing to the surge in complaintsThis increase may not be attributable only to the rising awareness after the introduction of the new category.“The jump in mis-selling complaints could be partly due to re-categorisation and partly on the account of the rise in awareness. Mis-selling is covered under the fair practices code as well the BCSBI code of commitment to customers. It is possible that such complaints, which were filed under these two codes so far, have made their way to this category,” explains Anand Aras, CEO, Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI).From 24.25 per cent in 2016-17, the proportion of complaints under non-observance of fair practices code dipped to 22.1 per cent in 2017-18 – the year when mis-selling was carved out as a separate ground for making a complaint. In 2018-19, the share has dropped further to 19.17 per cent, hinting at the possibility of such complaints being re-directed at the newly-minted category.Even the increased complaint count, though, does not appear to be commensurate with the magnitude of the malpractice in public consciousness. Unscrupulous bank officials are often accused of selling unsuitable investment-cum-insurance policies to gullible customers. “The complaints related to mis-selling have gone up sharply when we compared on a year-on-year basis; but if you compute mis-selling cases to total complaints, then it’s less than 5 per cent,” says Vikram Babbar, Partner and Financial Services Lead, Forensic & Integrity Services, EY.Since the annual report does not provide a break-up of complaints covered under non-adherence to fair practices and BCSBI codes, it is difficult to ascertain the scale of the menace in its entirety. These two categories accounted for 19.17 per cent and 3.05 per cent, respectively of the total complaints in 2018-19.NoneMis-selling as a new categoryHowever, the introduction of mis-selling as a separate complaint category has brought about clarity, which banking customers can use to their advantage. Industry-watchers believe the rise in awareness is one of the reasons for the higher number of mis-selling complaints.“They now know how to raise a complaint, where to raise the complaint and the issues with products sold that constitute valid grounds for approaching the banking ombudsman,” says Sunil Khosla, Head Digital Business of India Transact Services Limited.Yet, a large number of complaints get rejected on technical grounds. Therefore, it is important to adhere to the prescribed procedure for filing complaints. For one, do not approach the ombudsman’s office directly. You must first register your grievance with your bank. Only if your bank does not respond within 30 days from the date of filing the complaint or the response is not to your satisfaction should you escalate the matter."

title,Explainer| The third party administrator in health insurance
datetime,2019-12-26 08:33:00+00:00
description,A TPA  acts as an intermediary between the insurance company and the policyholder
content,"Recently, the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI) allowed health insurance policyholders to choose their third party administrator (TPA) while buying the cover or at the time of renewal. This move empowers the consumer and, at the same time, underlines the importance of the TPA in the process of claims handling and settlement. Here are a few things you must know about a TPA.The role of a TPAA TPA acts as an intermediary between the insurance company and the policyholder. When the policyholder want to lodge a claim, she is expected to contact the TPA, which in turn identifies a network hospital and guides the customer. In case of cashless claims, the TPA issues an authorisation letter, co-ordinates with the hospital authorities and after the treatment, collects the documents, bills etc. from the hospital and sends them to the insurer for settlement.In the case of non-network hospitals, the policyholder pays first and later sends the claim documents to the TPA. The insurer then reimburses the policyholder.The TPA does not take a decision pertaining to the payment or rejection of the claim; its role is restricted to being a facilitator.What has changed?The sector sector regulator has empowered insurance policy buyers by allowing them to select the TPA of their choice. This choice can be exercised from the list of TPAs appointed by the insurance company. The insurer has the right to discontinue the service of a TPA. But in such a scenario, the consumer needs to be given an alternative.“Insurance buyers should look at the hospital network coverage of the TPA and volume of claims handled by the TPA in the past. They can also look at the turn-around time for claim settlement while choosing a TPA,” says Abhishek Bondia, co-founder and principal officer of SecureNow. The list of network hospitals and the volume handled are available in the website of the TPA. Some TPAs mention their turn-around times as well.“Past experience with a TPA could also be a reason for choosing a specific TPA. The insurer will provide access to all the details pertaining to the TPA, at the time of purchasing the policy,” says Amit Chhabra, Head- Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com.Who can be the TPA?According to IRDA (TPA- health services) regulations, a company can apply for a TPA license from the IRDAI. After following due process and satisfying the eligibility criteria, the license is issued. After obtaining the licence, the TPA is appointed by the insurance company to assist the policyholder in the claim settlement process."

datetime,2019-12-26 21:00:00+00:00
description,The need of the hour is the transformation of physical banks into Phygital ones to establish humanized digital experiences.
content,"The shelf life of physical banks has reduced over the past few years. Recently, Jio’s internet explosion in India marked the watershed moment which initiated the radical shift of things from physical to digital. Increasing numbers of Fintech apps and neo-banks have more or less replaced traditional banking, at least in urban India, leading to the closing down of many physical banks.The result of this rapid transformation in banking retail practices is a new concept- one that combines the advantages of digitisation with the comfort of a brick and mortar bank - Phygital Banking is making inroads to take banking operations into the new decade. Phygital is the portmanteau of physical and digital. Phygital banking emphasizes on being inherently digital in both physical and digital channels backed by humans.Digital is springing high but it doesn’t mean that physical banking will not be in the state of need. The first step of Phygital banking is that all brick and motor banks should opt for digital banking with the implementation of cutting-edge technologies for its operations. Incorporating Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), open banking, ensuring cybersecurity and enhancing the digital experience of the customers will transform a conventional bank into a digital one. The addition of human interaction to this digital transformation is what takes banking to a whole new level.The advantage of Phygital is that it still allows traditional visits to a bank office for those who cannot keep up with the rapid digitization in banking operations, and thus banks can ensure the trust and comfort that eventually leads to customer satisfaction. The digital aspect is that these physical banks also grant enhancement of the customer experience with advanced technologies expediting the banking processes for customers and ensure an enjoyable atmosphere during their visit to banks.Phygital puts forth a hybrid experience where physical and digital combine to connect emotionally with customers. For example, customers of the BofA who need financial advice or banking guidance are arranged video conferencing with bank officials in the situations of their inability to come over directly but still needed a trusted and reliable conversation. Capital One bank created cool cafes and appealing meeting rooms to casually discuss the financial stuff. This is the big picture of Phygital Banking!"

title,How to invest in MFs using the UPI
datetime,2019-12-26 08:25:00+00:00
description,You can invest a lump-sum in an existing or new scheme
content,"The unified payments interface (UPI) is popular among many as a preferred payment mode. According to the data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), transactions done through UPI in value terms were at an all-time high in October 2019. It crossed Rs 1.91 lakh crore.Now, apart from using the UPI for paying utility bills, buying groceries or transferring money to others, you can also use it for investing in mutual funds.Since 2018, fund houses such as Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Baroda Pioneer AMC and IDFC Asset Management and distributors such as FundsIndia allow you to invest in mutual funds using the UPI. Here is how you can use the UPI to invest in funds.Who can invest in mutual funds using UPI?Existing as well as new investors in mutual funds can invest using the UPI payment system. You can invest a lump-sum in an existing or new scheme. However, new investors opting for a systematic investment plan (SIP) in any specific scheme can only initiate first instalment using the UPI. This is because a standing instruction such as the electronic clearance service (ECS) mandate (monthly/quarterly) from a bank account is presently not available in the UPI for SIP investors.Essentials for transactingYou need to have a bank account that can facilitate fund transfers through the UPI payment system. Also, these banks should allow you to link your bank account with UPI-based applications such as Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), GooglePay and PhonePe.If you are presently using UPI applications regularly, you will have a virtual ID linked with your bank account to carry out investment in mutual funds. But, if you are a new UPI user, you need to link the registered mobile number with your bank account. A virtual ID will be generated in the UPI application using your name or mobile number. The virtual id looks similar to your email ID – for example,  yourname@bankname.Investment processThe investment process using the UPI app is similar to regular UPI payment transactions. First, you need to choose UPI as the payment mode on fund house’s website or using the mutual fund distributor’s platform that supports the UPI interface while investing. Then, you need to provide your UPI virtual ID. Next, you will receive a notification on your mobile phone from the UPI app you chose for payment. Here, verify your transaction details and authorise the investment using the mobile PIN generated on the UPI app. Immediately, your bank account will be debited and investment amount is transferred to the fund house. You don’t need to log in to your net banking for investments in mutual funds using the UPI.Advantages for investorsYou can invest in mutual funds through various modes such as net banking, national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) and cheques from your bank account. Now UPI too is an avenue to do so.Harshil Morjaria, a Mumbai-based certified financial planner of ValueCurve Financial Solutions says, “When you invest in mutual funds through cheque, NEFT or net banking, the money does not get deposited with the fund house immediately; it gets processed the next day. So, mutual fund units are not allotted at the same day’s net asset value (NAV) you were looking for while investing.” Now, using the UPI interface, investment in mutual funds is instant after you authorise the transaction. So, there is a possibility that units are allotted at the closing NAV of the same day.Limitations of the interface"

title,All about making the receipt of dividends a smooth affair
datetime,2019-12-26 08:28:00+00:00
description,"Investors holding shares of a company on the record date are eligible. If there is a discrepancy in your bank account details, the dividend does not get credited."
content,"Apart from capital appreciation, investors in stock markets seek dividends. There are some companies that are specifically attractive as they provide good dividend yields. Normally the period for the payout to investors is from July to November every year.If you are an investor in a company that has declared dividends, but are yet to receive it, there may be several reasons why you may not have received the payout.Are you eligible for receiving the dividend?Many times, investors track companies that announce dividends and then plan to buy the shares of those firms. It could be a short-term trade; it may also be a good bet for the long run. However, many forget that timing the purchase is important in such a situation. You should be the shareholder of the company on the record date. “Investors holding shares of a company on the record date are eligible for the dividend. If you buy the shares at least two days before the record date, then you would be eligible for the dividend,” says Narendra Jain, Director, IIFL Securities.For example, if the record date is December 12, then investors who buy the shares on (or before) December 10 are eligible for dividends, as the shares will reach their demat account on  December 12. Those who buy it on 11 December will not get paid, as the shares would reach their demat accounts only on December 13 – after the record date. Thus a T+2 settlement cycle is followed.The dates of announcement, record and payout of dividend can be different. In case of hefty dividend payouts, the stock price adjusts closer to the record date.Most proactive brokers, using technology to their advantage, do update you on dividend announcements. A full-service broker alerts clients on such payouts.Non-receipt of dividends A registrar and transfer agent (RTA) helps the company to ascertain the list of eligible shareholders for the payout of dividends. The company credits the dividend amount to the bank account registered with the demat account. The credits appear in your bank account statement, typically, with the description as ‘ACH/Company name.’If there is a discrepancy in the bank account details, then the dividend does not get credited. “If there is a change in the bank account details, then investors need to update the same in the records of the depository participant,” says Narendra.Bank account details include the name of the account holder, account number, IFSC code and MICR code. These can be found on the cheque leaf issued by the bank. There can be many reasons behind a discrepancy. “In case of merger of two banks, the bank details may change. When a branch is merged with another branch of the same bank, though the bank account number remains the same, the IFSC code changes and that may cause non-credit of dividend,” says Prafull Pophali, financial planner at Mumbai-based SMS Financial Services.Check if your bank details are up-to-date in the records of your demat account.What you must do"

description,The move comes after the chargesheet filed by ED in PMLA court earlier this month
content,"The late gangster and drug trafficker Iqbal Mirchi's family is under the scanner of officials from the United Kingdom's Scotland Yard and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).According to highly places sources, the UK-based Scotland Yard recently questioned two associates of Mirchi that have been working closely with him since he fled to the UK in the late eighties.A red corner notice was issued against Mirchi by the Interpol in 1994, and he was designated as a Significant Narcotics Trafficker under Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Act by the US.NoneMirchi and his family owns around fifteen properties in the UK, and according to the chargesheet compiled by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), most of the properties have been bought using proceeds from crime.The ED has provisionally attached a number of immovable properties related to the Iqbal Memon, alias Iqbal Mirchi, case.Meanwhile, in the UAE, where Mirchi's children, Asif and Junaid Memon, and his first wife, Hajra Memon, are presently residing and running various business like hotels, and are under the scanner of the UAE authorities.The ED chargesheet states that after fleeing from India in late eighties , Mirchi brought a hotel named Imperial Suites from the proceeds of his crimes, and used it as a front to launder money to his UK-based companies.Also, in a recent probe, it was discovered that three working properties were sold to DHFL's Dheeraj Wadhawan for Rs 225 crore, and were used to buy a hotel named Midwest Apartment in UAE. A source confirmed that the authorities from the UAE might seek details from ED on the findings.Mirchi was an international drugs dealer and smuggler, who had amassed huge wealth and acquired various immovable properties and businesses across the globe.After a detailed investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), some of these properties held in India have been provisionally attached by the Directorate against two Provisional Attachment Orders. The market value of these properties is around Rs 600 crore.In the first Provisional Attachment Order, immovable properties, having value of Rs 76.32 crore in 2010, have been provisionally attached.These properties include the third and fourth floor of CEEJAY House , Worli, Mumbai; an office premise at Arun Chambers, Tardeo, Mumbai; three flats in Sahil Bungalow, Worli, Mumbai; three prime commercial shops in Crawford Market, Mumbai; and bungalows and land spanning more than 5 acres in Lonawala. These properties were acquired by Iqbal Mirchi in the name of his family members and relatives.The investigation under the PMLA also revealed that Mirchi indirectly owned various properties in and around Mumbai. His family owned 14,000 sqft of the third and fourth floor of Ceejay House — a 15-floor prime commercial property in Worli, Mumbai. This property was redeveloped by Millennium Developer. Investigations also revealed that certain part of plot was earlier in possession of one MK Mohammad.Iqbal Mirchi entered into an agreement with MK Mohammed for acquiring the rights in the property in the name of his wife Hajra Memon for Rs 9 lakh and the agreement was executed in 1986.Though payments of only Rs 20,000 was made in 1986, the possession of the property was taken by Iqbal Memon in 1986 itself and he started running a discotheque by the name of 'Fisherman’s Wharf'. Later on, at the time of redevelopment, Mirchi was given 14,000 sqft on the third and fourth floor of the newly constructed Ceejay House in Worli Area in the name of his wife Hajra Memon and his sons.Three flats in one more prime property, Sahil Bunglow, were also acquired by Mirchi in the name of his relatives during the same period. In order to hide the criminal origin of the funds to acquire the properties, he purchased one flat each in the name of his wife Hajra Memon, his sister Zaibunnisaa Mohammad Memon, and brother Aslam Merchant.The intentions became clear when Aslam Merchant gifted his and Zaibunnisaa Menon’s (as her heir) share in the property to his Mirchi's wife Hajra Memom, and her son Junaid Memon. This meant that the entire property is in possession of the family of Iqbal Memon, and was purchased by Iqbal Mirchi from one Iqbal Doodhwala.The property in Lonawala was earlier in the name of Hajra Memon. In 2005, the ownership of the same was transferred without any consideration to M/s White Water Developers, a company formed by Humayun Merchant, who is a close associate of Iqbal Mirchi. In 2010, the directorship of White Water Developers was transferred to Junaid Iqbal Memon and Asif Iqbal Memon, who are the sons of Iqbal Mirchi.In the second Provisional Attachment order, three properties, having present market value of around Rs 500 crore, have been attached. These properties are at Rabia Mansion, Marium Lodge and Sea View in the prime location of Worli, Mumbai. The investigation revealed that Sunblink Real Estate paid a total amount of Rs 111.80 crore to various persons/entities, including Mirchi, in India in relation to the purchase of development rights of these properties in addition to approximately Rs 154 crore  paid to Iqbal Mirchi in Dubai."

But, entrepreneurship still remains a metro phenomenon with startups from Ecommerce, Travel, Transport, Edutech, SaaS and FinTech space trying to solve for smaller needs like home deliveries of products, easier and faster loans, seamless travel experiences etc.95 percent of startups in India are catering to 20 percent rich and upper middle class population of India. The remaining 80 percent of the population remains unserved as their problems are quite different than those of the rest. This 80 percent - termed as Bharat - are confronting challenges like instant access to healthcare, sanitation, pollution, housing and good education.These new 500 odd million internet users pose a great opportunity for startups. However its characteristics like low costs, language support, consistent customer care, pose an equally large problem. In recent times, there has been a spike in the number of founders trying to solve real problems of the country probably witnessed by them personally.The number is growing but is still miniscule. They are trying to bridge the gap between the lowest 70 percent of the population and the amenities that do not reach them. Government too is giving such startups a push. This is evident from the recent “Ayushman Bharat Start-Up Grand Challenge”, where government funded innovators are solving problems for better healthcare in India.Here is a shoutout to 4 such startups that are working towards the betterment of Bharat:NoneThe teleconsultations are available in 11 languages and 24/7 via the platform’s app, website, and phone. The platform also provides an e-health profile, insurance claim support, and discounted medicine delivery and lab testing. Clinikk also provides cashless hospitalisation benefits to the ground level people in more than 5,500 empanelled hospitals across the country. It is one of the few startups that which is working on the ground level and providing primary health care to the people who are in need. It is the only platform in India that provides primary healthcare with financial risk protection.NoneAlmost 90 percent of India is Bharat, which has not adopted digital commerce yet.

description,"After completing five years, in case you decide to buy the car then you need to arrange for a balloon repayment – a large lump-sum"
content,"Do you want to drive a car with the option of switching models every three to five years? You can now do so by leasing a brand new model. ICICI Bank has launched a new car loan facility, in association with TranzLease, an automobile leasing and mobility solutions company. This auto loan facility is called the ‘Smart EMI’ scheme. It allows you to own a new car at a lower cost compared to a traditional car loan.Sunil Gupta, MD and CEO of car rental service provider Avis India says, “At present, car leasing has a penetration of less than one per cent in India, mainly driven by corporates. We expect this to pick up now, driven by individual consumers since it offers convenience compared to buying a car. It also saves on maintenance costs.”What is it about?The Smart EMI scheme involves paying equated monthly instalments (EMIs) for 36 months (3 years) or 60 months (5 years), depending on the option taken, along with the down payment, insurance and taxes in the first year. The EMI includes the cost of maintenance for the vehicle throughout the tenure and insurance renewals. The scheme deducts the estimated resale value of the car upfront to reduce your EMI. At the end of the tenure, you can either choose to buy this vehicle or surrender.Ravi Narayanan, Head - Secured Assets, ICICI Bank says, “This is an innovative financing option developed for car enthusiasts to help them to take home a car of their choice on lease without having to worry about financing, insurance and maintenance.” The scheme is extended across car ranges starting from entry level hatchbacks to the luxury segment sedans and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).At present, the scheme is available for corporates and salaried individuals. The bank  plans to extend this offer to self-employed customers as well.What’s on offer?You get to ride a brand new model when you opt for the loan plan. For example, a new Maruti-CIAZ model, which costs Rs 10 lakh (ex-showroom price), would come with an EMI of Rs 18,683 (including taxes). You will have to pay a minimum of 10 per cent of the car’s price upfront; the first year’s insurance premium and taxes are to be paid additionally. The cost is inclusive of maintenance expenses. Insurance is comprehensive, with zero depreciation and a consumables cover.If you want to exit the Smart EMI during the tenure of the loan, the bank and leasing company provide you with two options. The first is buying the car by paying the outstanding loan value. The amount is stated in the contract agreement. Or, you can surrender your car to the leasing company. The difference between the market value of the car and outstanding loan value needs to be paid by you. While closing the scheme, prepaid insurance (if any) and dues (if any) will be recovered from you.There is a limit on the number of kms you are allowed to drive in a leased car. You need to discuss your average driving in a month and choose the appropriate plan.The Smart EMI scheme offers a cash back and bonus amount to customers taking this scheme. The bank offers a referral cash back amount of Rs 16,667 per car. While surrendering the car, the scheme offers a guaranteed bonus amount. The amount is calculated by TranzLease based on the minimum resale price at the end of the loan tenure.When you purchase the same car on a regular loan, there will be additional costs relating of insurance and maintenance.NoneWhat doesn’t work? Leasing may offer convenience to you, but there is no resale option at the end of tenure. Amol Joshi, founder of financial advisory firm Plan Rupee Investment Services says, “After repaying the traditional car loan, you can resell the car in the market. So, you get to earn a certain resale value. In a leased car, you don’t have the option of resale.”There are caps on the distance you are allowed to drive in a month and if you exceed those, you are penalised by the leasing company with additional costs. The company also reduces the guaranteed bonus amount while surrendering the car at the end of the tenure.In case of accidents during the tenure of the Smart EMI loan, the guaranteed bonus amount can be reduced. Also, insurance cost is increased, leading to an increase in the EMI.Sapna Tiwari, Co-Founder and COO, Rupeewiz Investment Advisors says, “While taking a car on loan, at the end of the tenure, you own the car but in a car lease scheme, you own nothing.”After completing five years, in case you decide to buy the car then you need to arrange for a balloon repayment – a large lump-sum. Alternatively, you can convert the outstanding loan value into an EMI with the bank and continue to pay the interest on it.Moneycontrol’s take  Lease a car using the Smart EMI scheme if you simply love to drive a new vehicle every three to five years. Also, the Smart EMI facility is recommended for individuals/families on the move from one city to another with jobs of short tenures (one to three years). They will save on add-on costs, which include registration of the car with the regional transport office (RTO) and other miscellaneous expenses while purchasing a vehicle. Fully understand the costs and the contractual terms."

title,Is the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana suitable for your daughter’s goals?
datetime,2019-12-26 08:21:00+00:00
description,The SSY is a very illiquid product and should be chosen only if it suits the investor’s actual objective of accumulating savings for the girl child’s future.
content,"Dev AshishAs a parent, saving for your children’s future is a big responsibility. And many times, and understandably, people are willing to sacrifice retirement savings for their children’s future.If you have a young daughter, then you would have come across the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) many times.But is it a good option? And does it make sense for everyone who has a daughter to invest in the SSY?Small savings, higher returnsBeing part of government’s small savings schemes, the SSY often gets compared with products such as the PPF (public provident fund). The SSY does give higher returns, of 8.4 per cent, than PPF (7.9 per cent).But ‘higher returns’ alone shouldn’t sway your investment decision.The SSY has certain in-built restrictions that make it a very illiquid product and should be chosen only if it suits the investor’s actual objective of accumulating savings for the girl child’s future.As per the rules of the SSY:- A Sukanya Samriddhi Account or SSA can be opened only up to 10 years age of the girl child.- It matures on completion of 21 years from the date of account opening (note that it’s not related to the girl’s age).NoneFor example: If an SSA opened on Dec 15, 2019, then deposits can be made only up to Dec 14, 2034 (15 years) and the account would mature on Dec 14, 2040 (after 21 years).-There is an option for premature closure (before 21 years since account opening) for the girl’s marriage (only available if she is above 18).But what if you need the money for the girl’s education before that?The SSY rules allow partial withdrawal for higher education. You can withdraw up to 50 per cent of the SSA balance at the end of previous financial year. So if you want to withdraw money for your daughter’s education in August 2029, you can withdraw 50 per cent of the balance at the end of the previous FY, March 2028.Now let’s take two scenarios, which will highlight why SSA may not work in every parent-daughter situation:A parent opens SSA for her daughter aged two. She keeps making investments for the first 15 years (girl’s age 2-17). No investment is to be made from years 16 to 21 (girl’s age 18-23). Now SSA allows withdrawal only after the age of 18, that too only 50 per cent of the corpus as of the previous FY. In this case, it would be fine, assuming that 50 per cent of the SSA balance in the previous year would be enough for the daughter’s higher education needs.Another parent opens an SSA for her daughter aged 8. She invests for the first 15 years (girl’s age 8-23). No investment is to be made from years 16 to 21 (girl’s age 24-31). So, in this case, amounts can be withdrawn fully only after the daughter is almost 30-31. And even though 50 per cent of the corpus can be withdrawn when the daughter turns 18, it must be noted that by then, the account would have only completed 9-10 years of existence and hence, may not have enough savings for education itself.Need to open the account earlySo, it can be said that if you don’t open an account for your daughter when she is very young, the SSY may not be enough to fund her higher education needs. In that case, the SSY becomes more of a tool to save for marriage as the account matures when the girl is in her mid-to-late 20s (for accounts opened when girl is aged 5-10).Many parents who had opened an SSA realize this late due to the misunderstanding that the account matures when their daughters turns 21. In reality, account matures 21 years after being opened and not when the girl turns 21.NoneFor those who have very young daughters, it makes sense to take some exposure to equity as well as it’s the only way to beat inflation in the long run. Equity mutual funds give you the best shot at inflation-beating returns in the long run.So, if you need some amount for your daughter’s education after 12-15 years and for marriage after 20-plus years, then consider investing in equity funds via regular SIP (systematic investment plan) as well.Even though SSY has a favorable tax status, it may not help you fulfill your daughter’s education and marriage goals. You need to beat inflation too."

When you’re in the flow to play a game, you can — all you have to do is open an app and start playing. However, with the help of poker games, you can end up making a good sum of money as well.The top-most cognitively demanding card games are those that incorporate memory, strategy, and attentiveness. It may be as simple as playing concentration or match with a partner, or as complex as an evening playing bridge. One of the challenges of a hearty round of poker is perceiving and interpreting the subtle signals others emanate as they try to win the game. This combines an array of both cognitive and complex interpersonal skills that really keep the brain sharp.The clear answer is YES when it comes to if poker is useful for your brain. Poker game teaches and improves various skills & personal qualities. Reduces risk of Alzheimer's diseaseAlzheimer's is known to be a neurodegenerative disorder that has a genetic predisposition and no certain cure has been recognized as of now. However, it can be prevented with certain cognitive sports and poker is one of them.Studies have shown that playing poker can actually reduce your chances of developing brain-related diseases like Alzheimer’s by over 50 percent.Leads to rewiring the brainPoker acts like Pushups for our brain. It strengthens your brain and shields your nerve cells. Playing poker can help to rewire your brain and help to create myelin for a longer run. When we perform any activity consistently, it leads to the creation of new neural pathways. The nerve fibers are surrounded by a myelin sheath. This protects and nourishes the nerve cell. The more often impulses are transmitted through this network, the thicker the myelin sheath becomes. This is called myelination. Hence, the more poker we play the more myelin our brains create.Poker also helps in controlling emotions and making quick decisions that increase cognitive capacity, hence improving your chances of keeping a healthy brain."

title,Why are Indian millennials not buying real estate?
datetime,2019-12-23 17:13:00+00:00
description,"Among other factors, millennials don’t want a huge EMI burden early on in their careers"
content,"Prateek Goel For those born between the 1950s and the mid-1980s, owning a home was typically seen as a status symbol, a financial security and a necessity. Not only was owning a home considered to be a major milestone in life but renting a home is considered as disparaging. On the contrary, people born in the late 80s and 90s do not consider buying a home as a sense of accomplishment. They would rather travel to 50 countries before they turn 30, have three jobs or own their business rather than buy a home. This has led to a paradigm shift in the Indian real estate industry.Millennials are content sharing their apartments with more people if it helps them save on real estate costs, or fund their next trip, next car, next outing or the next iPhone. It is important to note and understand the underlying drivers of millennials’ behavior and why they are no longer interested in buying real estate as compared to the previous generations.Why do millennials not want to buy?Millennials don’t want a huge EMI burden early on in their careers. They do not want something that will take away 20-30 per cent of their salaries. They do not want to be tied down to a mortgage, as it adds risks to their lives. In the ever-changing corporate landscape, millennials also don't want to be tied down to a house for the rest of their lives. They want to have the flexibility of moving jobs or countries.Renting is cheaper than buyingAccording to JLL research, the price of a two bedroom-hall-kitchen apartment in Andheri, Mumbai, is around Rs 1.9 crore; in Hinjewadi, Pune, it is around Rs 75 lakh, while in Kondapur, Hyderabad it is about Rs 80 lakh. Buying such a house via loans translates to a monthly equated monthly installment (EMI) of around Rs 1.3 lakh for Mumbai, Rs 50,000 for Pune and Rs 56,000 for Hyderabad.Rent-wise, Mumbai residents can expect to pay a rent of around Rs 40,000 per month, Rs 23,000 for Pune and 30,000 for Hyderabad for the same localities.Clearly there is a 2.5-4.5 times difference between rent and EMIs. If renting is 30 per cent of what owning would be, why would you want to buy?What’s more, co-living spaces are more like college dorms for adults. Single millennials prefer a co-living space close to work. They get to meet new people and participate in social activities.Complexity of home buying proceduresThe utter fragmentation, miscommunication and complete lack of technology in the industry are big deterrents in the home-buying process. It would help if home loans are available with less paperwork and procedures. In the same breadth, there is enough and more empirical evidence as well as actual data that shows that these young millennials are turning to fintech companies to take loans for very trivial purposes because most fintech companies give loans at the tap of a button on your mobile and with little verification. Too much of ease, therefore, is also a danger.How different is it in the US?While it is debatable whether debt is a good or bad, in the US, people are more comfortable with debt compared to those in India. The culture is changing, however, with Indians becoming a little more comfortable with debt.Another factor that plays well with the US is low interest rates on housing loans. In India, housing loan interest rates range around 8-11 per cent, in the US they range around 2.5-5 per cent. Saving around 5 percentage points in interest is huge. Imagine, if you bought a house for Rs 1 crore, it would mean a saving of close to Rs 5 lakh in interest per year.Also, buying a home is easy and transparent. Almost everything is electronic, and the market is very heavily regulated. Paperwork is easier compared to that in India and the overall process takes about 30-45 days.When will make Indians buy more homes?Rental limitationsIn the US, most housing, apartment and row house community associations restrict renting. That automatically forces people to buy homes in sought-after neighborhoods.Rent and EMI parity As the rents increase and EMIs decrease, it will start making more sense to own than to buy. To make owning a house more attractive in India, the rent to EMI ratio will need to be similar. This can be coupled with more tax incentives for first-time home ownership, way more than it does right now. This can be done by giving income tax incentives, property tax waivers amongst other things that reduce the burden for first-time homebuyersEase of buying and selling homesIf the entire process is transparent and takes about 30 days or so to complete, homebuyers would be more willing to sign up for doing all that. If more companies can offer easy-to-understand mortgage packages that can be compared across vendors, it will incentivize the millennial buyerSmarter buying toolsA majority of India’s working millennial population makes purchasing decisions on their mobile phones. Availability of online mortgage estimators, online loan approvals, tools to check on property rates, and shop mortgage lenders will make it easy for the Indian young millennial to consider buying a home. The flipside: too much of technology in making loans available can also lead young and millennials into a debt trap.In conclusion, India has a long way to go before the real estate adoption rate increases to match that of countries such as the US and UK. Overall, in our opinion, buying at least one house is generally a good idea to give yourself some financial security in your old age. If you can afford to buy a house, consult your financial advisor for a suitable course of action."

description,Investors are advised to remain stock-specific as the upside remains fairly limited but small & midcaps could play catch up
content,"Indian market closed the year 2019 on a buoyant note with Sensex and Nifty50 rallying over 10 percent. It was a historic year for D-Street as Sensex made a new high above 41,800 while Nifty50 came close to 12,300 levels.The year 2020 will also be a year when benchmark indices will hit new milestones and probably Nifty will surpass 13,000 levels and 45,000 mark for Sensex, suggest experts.Foreign institutional investors continued to reaffirm their faith in Indian market in 2019, and the trend is likely to continue in 2020 as well. In CY19 till date, India has attracted USD 14.3 bn from FPIs and USD 7.5 bn from local mutual funds.“We expect FPI flows could remain positive in CY20 and SIP flows to remain sticky with an annualized run rate of ~USD 14-15 bn. Earnings of Nifty-50 is expected to report a robust 19% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for next three years, a sharp increase over the previous three years CAGR of 8%,” Rusmik Oza, Sr. VP (Head of Fundamental Research-PCG), Kotak Securities Ltd told Moneycontrol.“We have used a benchmark of 17.5x forward PE, which is one standard deviation above the 10-year average to derive at our one-year Nifty target. Our one-year target of Nifty-50 and Sensex works to 13,400 and 45,500, respectively. This works to an upside of ~10% from current levels,” he said.Investors are advised to remain stock-specific as the upside remains fairly limited but small & midcaps could play catch up in the year 2020 that could possibly turn out to wealth-creating opportunities for investors.“While midcaps outperformed large-caps significantly in FY15-18, it witnessed a reversal in trend amid liquidity issues along with IL&Fs crisis and other corporate defaults over the past 18 months,” ICICIdirect.“In turn, this skewed the investor’s focus on quality companies with high governance standards and stable growth. Hence, only quality companies in both these indices have outperformed the market as seen in the below table. Going forward also, we believe the quality stock selection approach will continue to find favour rather than an index specific approach,” he said.We spoke to various experts and here’s what they have recommended for the year 2020:Expert: Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment AdvisorDabur India:The stock has closed positive for the eighth consecutive calendar year. Since 2012, the stock has rallied over 360 percent. Dabur is planning to expand into healthcare, foods and personal care segment by acquiring new companies and reviving its sales.It is also looking towards increased rural penetration by increasing its rural network to cover up to 55,000 villages.Manappuram Finance:The stock has traded at a record high of Rs 178 and has rallied over 90 percent in the calendar year 2019 so far. Price has formed higher highs & higher lows formation in the broader time frame.The financials of Manappuram Finance Ltd show net sales growth of 16.79 percent and core EBITDA growth of 20.58 percent.The company has jotted down 4.92 percent ROA (Return on Assets), 19.40 percent ROE (Return on Equity) and 14.34 percent ROCE (Return on Capital employed).The net sales growth of the company being 16.79 percent, core EBITDA growth being 20.58 percent and PAT growth of 14.71 percent signify the sound operations and a profitable business model which provides good scope for appreciation of the stock.ICICI Securities:In calendar year 2019, the stock has traded with volatility in first two-months with stock price declining as much as 27.63 percent, and after consolidating in a narrow range, stock price gained over 110 percent since August 2019.This stock seems to be very promising because of its 46.85 percent Return on Equity and 32.73 percent Return on Assets.With changing business model i.e. shifting from pure broking to an array of other services like advisory services, wealth management etc., could reduce the volatility in earnings and revenue.Dividend pay-out ratio of 2.20 is a very lucrative aspect which might give rise to a lot of bullish sentiments along with a cash surplus balance sheet which is icing on the cake.Affle (India):The stock was listed on NSE in August 2019 and has jumped as much as 87.8 percent from its listing price within four months.With a ROA of 20.10 percent, ROE of 43.64 percent, & ROCE of 62.77 percent, it can be said that this is a profitable business. It has had an EBITDA growth of 58.79 percent and PAT growth of 88.87 percent which shows its sound revenue from operations thus it can be a stock with great potential.Adani Enterprises:The financials of this organisation boast figures of 14.52 percent ROCE (Return on Capital Employed), 13.62% of ROE and 3.3 percent of ROA along with Net sales growth of 38.36 percent.This company has receivable cycle of 89.55 days and Payable cycle of 117.66 days which is a very favourable and efficient position.Expert: Ritesh Asher – Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade CapitalBharat Electronics (BEL):The Company has 37 percent market share in Indian Defense Electronics. Its core capabilities are in radar, and weapons systems, defense communication & electronic warfare.It derives incremental contributions from non-defense segments like homeland security, cybersecurity, and smart cities, which are expected to contribute ~20 percent to the revenue albeit with lower margins over the next three to five years.We expect BEL to report revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGR of 12.9%, 3.6%, 1.8% respectively, in FY19-21.Wipro:Wipro is a leading information technology, consulting and business process services company. The company had a dedicated workforce of over 180,000 serving clients across 6 continents.If we consider the company’s half-yearly performance it registered 4 percent YoY hike in sales, the company’s cost optimization strategy and strong client relationships will help the company gain lost ground in the long term.State Bank of India:SBI is the largest commercial bank in India with over 1/5th market share of the Indian banking sector. It has a strong domestic presence with more than 22,090 branches and an international presence with 198 branches across 37 countries.Within PSU banks, SBI remains the best play on a corporate recovery in the Indian economy. With heavy NCLT resolutions lined up, we believe asset quality improvement is imminent and project Gross/Net NPA ratios to moderate to 6.9%/3.5% by FY21E, and with government measures to boost the PSU health SBI bank is supposed have brighter future among its peer group.Jubilant FoodWorks:The Dominos brand owned company is structurally attractive and have the capacity to outperform micro & macro-economic concerns.The company is a market leader in the pizza segment through its exclusive rights to operate Domino's Pizza brand outlets in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Pizza is the largest sub-segment in the QSR space, which is expected to grow at more than 15 percent per fiscal over the medium term driven by an increase in consumer propensity to eat out, rising disposable income, a greater need for convenience.On the financial front, the company is available at an attractive valuation with debt-free status and the Return on capital employed remained above 25 percent.HDFC Bank:HDFC Bank is among the largest private sector banks in India with total assets of Rs.12,44,541 crore as on March 31, 2019.

In 2019, bank had 5130 banking outlets.While if we take a look in banking sector HDFC Bank is available at very attractive valuation with low PE high EPS earning compared to its peer group. The bank maintains healthy financials and risk status as advances and deposits grew amidst weak market sentiments as well operating performance improved with cost efficiencies in FY2019.Expert: D K Agarwal Chairman & MD, SMC Investments and Advisors LtdICICI Bank:The bank continues to focus on growing the core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner. The bank aims to improve the share of profitable market opportunities by making a delivery to the customer more seamless and frictionless through digitization and process improvements.The business of the bank increased at an accelerated pace of 19 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 13,09,632 crore at the end of September 2019, supported by deposits growth rising to 25 percent at Rs 6,96,273 crore at end September 2019.

It has a tie-up with Thai Union Group, Thailand.In the Feed segment, which contributes ~78 percent of total revenues, although the industry consumption growth is expected to be flat, the company expects growth of 12-15%, driven by market share gains (48% vs. 45% YoY).The recent improvement witnessed in farm-gate and stabilization in export prices provides a better outlook for both Feed & Processing segments. We have a BUY rating on AFL and it is valued at 16x considering the improved industry outlook, healthy growth & RoE and no Debt.Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare BrokingL&T:L&T boasts of a strong order book, high earnings visibility and healthy project pipeline. Further, continuous monetization of non-core assets has been improving its working capital efficiency and likely to improve its returns. The recent correction in the stock has also made its valuation attractive.Britannia Industries:The FMCG sector is currently facing a slowdown, however, revival is expected in the medium to long term.Further, management expects a revival in the economy and thus it continues to focus on strengthening its presence by increasing market share, expanding distribution reach in both rural and urban areas, premiumizing and launching innovative products, steady capacity addition and improved product mix.Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Company (RNAM):RNAM is one of the leading AMCs in India with a total AUM of ~Rs. 4,530 bn. The buyout by Nippon Life Insurance (75% ownership currently) from Reliance Capital removes the overhang on RNAM.Further, the company has taken several initiatives in order to rebrand and strengthen the balance sheet which would help regain lost market share and thereby would narrow the valuation difference with HDFC AMC."

However, it's not known whether the state had sent a proposal to the ministry.In a statement, the Defence Ministry said tableau proposals received from states/UTs and central ministries and departments are evaluated in meetings of an expert committee comprising eminent persons in the field of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture and choreography.The rejection of tableaux has now taken political colour in several states with ruling parties criticising the Centre’s move.BiharThe Bihar government's proposed tableau, based on the theme of ""Jal-Jivan-Haryali mission"" failed to find favour. The 'Jal-Jivan-Haryali Abhiyan' was launched by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in October 2019 to boost green cover and ground water table in the state.According to PTI sources, the bid did not fulfill the necessary criteria laid down for choosing tableaux from the states for the occasion.The Janata Dal (United), which is ruling the state in coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not comment on the rejection, but opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) took potshots at the Centre for ""humiliating"" the people of Bihar by dismissing its tableau.MaharashtraAnother state whose tableau has been rejected by the Centre is Maharashtra. The move drew sharp criticism from ruling NCP and Shiv Sena, with the Sharad Pawar-led party dubbing the move an insult to the state.However, the state unit of the BJP said Maharashtra's tableau had not featured in the January 26 parade many times.West BengalThe tableau of West Bengal has also been rejected by the Centre. It was proposing to display at the parade its award-winning cash transfer scheme ""Kanyashree"" besides giving alternatives of ""Sabuj Sathi"" (distribution of bicycle among school students) and ""Jol Dhoro Jol Bhoro"" project that seeks to conserve water, according to PTI sources.The ruling TMC said the move insulted the people of the state for protesting against the amended Citizenship Act."

The government also lowered the tax rate for new manufacturing companies to 15 percent to attract new foreign direct investments.The tax rate reductions bring India in line with rates in other Asian countries.The government's other initiatives include bank recapitalisation, the mergers of 10 public sector banks into four, support for the auto sector, plans for infrastructure spending, as well as tax benefits for startups.But experts say none of these measures directly address the widespread weakness in consumption demand, which has been the chief driver of the economy.Also, financial sector fragilities continue to weigh on the economic growth momentum, with the high level of non-performing loans on the balance-sheets of the public sector banks, constraining their fresh lending.Furthermore, there are also risks from potential contagion effects from troubled non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) to the balance-sheets of some commercial banks, which could further weigh on the overall pace of credit expansion.In response to the growth slowdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has eased policy rates significantly during 2019, with a series of rate cuts since February 2019.Further stimulus measures are expected in the upcoming Budget where the focus is likely to be on reforms, including some structural measures such as reducing red tape and boosting foreign direct investment.The meeting with industrialists is in the series of discussions that Modi has had during the last couple of weeks to seek suggestions to revive growth.In the previous meetings, he met Kotak Mahindra Bank CEO Uday Kotak, State Bank of India head Rajnish Kumar, HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri, IT industry veteran TV Mohandas Pai; former finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia; Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani, Intel India general manager Nivruti Rai and Tata Consultancy Services chief executive Rajesh Gopinath.He also reportedly has held one-on-one meetings with sectoral experts.Modi has so far met over 60 entrepreneurs and businessmen from sectors such as FMCG, finance, renewable energy, diamond, retail, textiles, MSMEs and startups and technology.(With inputs from PTI)"

title,2020 to usher in lower EMIs for SBI’s home loan customers
datetime,2019-12-31 10:23:00+00:00
description,You can decrease the EMI and keep the loan tenure unchanged. The other alternative is to reduce your loan tenure and keep the EMI unchanged.
content,"In October 2019, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced that all banks should adopt an external benchmark for pricing their floating interest rate loans. So, banks have gradually started linking their floating rate loans to the repo. State Bank of India (SBI) reduced its external benchmark-based rate (EBR) by 25 basis points (bps) from 8.05 per cent to 7.80 per cent for existing home loan borrowers. Also, new borrowers will get loans at an interest rate starting from 7.90 per cent per annum compared to 8.15 per cent earlier. These new interest rates would be effective from January 1, 2020. The present rate cut is a result of the repo-rate cut announced on October 4, 2019 by the RBI. According to RBI guidelines, banks are required to reset their external benchmark based rates at least once in three months.Impact on home loan ratesFalling interest rates are expected to benefit SBI’s borrowers.Let’s say you apply for a home loan of Rs 1 crore with 20 years tenure. The applicable interest rate at present is 8.5 per cent, depending on your credit score. The new interest rate applicable from January 1, 2020 will be 8.25 per cent. So, the monthly instalment payable will be Rs 85,207, down from Rs 86,782. So, there is immediate saving of close to Rs 18,900 annually with the reduction in interest rates. Over the tenure of the loan, you will save around Rs 3.78 lakh.NoneThe table below gives details of what new home loan borrowers stand to gain.Whenever rates come down for existing borrowers there are two options offered by banks. One is to decrease the EMI and keep the loan tenure unchanged. The other alternative is to reduce your loan tenure and keep the EMI unchanged.Shalini Gupta, Co-founder and Chief strategy officer of MyLoanCare.in has this piece of advice: “Service the EMI with the same amount despite the repo rate cut announced by the RBI. This is because interest outgo on a short tenure loan is significantly lower than a longer tenure loan.” By paying the same EMI, you may able to close the loan account faster.Denny Tomy, Business Head at loan advisory firm, theloanguru.in adds, “A borrower can build a separate corpus by decreasing the EMI and invest those savings in mutual fund schemes that give higher returns than the interest being paid to the bank for the home loan.” Also, the corpus built over five years, for instance, will be helpful in paying a lump-sum amount and reducing the principal outstanding.Rate cuts not fully passed onDuring 2019, the RBI cut interest rates five times in a row. The repo rate is now 5.15 percent (the lowest in nine years; there was a 135 bps reduction in repo rate during 2019)."

This is expected to buffer loss incurred per delivery, sources told ET.Other sources told the paper that partners are also urged to invest in promotions and related services on the platform.

content,"Leaked images of the Maruti Suzuki Ignis facelift are doing the rounds on the net and from them it can be gathered that the new car gets tweaked aesthetics.The new Ignis gets an all-new bumper design with skid plates that have been extended.

description,"According to a regulatory filing by the company, Tata Motors had zero production and sales of the Nano in December 2019 while it produced 82 units and sold 88 units in December 2018."
content,"Tata Motors did not produce a single unit of its entry-level car Nano in 2019 although it sold just one unit in February even as the company is yet to officially retire Ratan Tata's ""people's car"".According to a regulatory filing by the company, Tata Motors had zero production and sales of the Nano in December 2019 while it produced 82 units and sold 88 units in December 2018.Similarly, in November 2019 there was zero production and sales of the entry-level model, whereas in the year-ago period it produced 66 units and sold 77 units.In October 2019 also, according to the filing, it did not produce or sell any unit of the Nano while in the year-ago month it rolled out 71 units while selling 54 units.In the first nine months of 2019 also Tata Motors did not produce a single unit of Nano.The company did not sell a single unit in any month last year except February when it sold just one, according to several regulatory filings by the company.Tata Motors has so far been maintaining that no decision has been made yet on the future of the Nano saying production planning of a car is a ""conscious management of demand, system inventory and planned efficiencies"".It has, however, admitted that in its current form the Nano will not meet the new safety regulations and BS-VI emission norms.Tata Motors had unveiled Nano in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being ""the people's car"", as dubbed by the then Tata group chief Ratan Tata. However, it could not live up to the billing with sales dwindling over the years.On the issue of discontinuing the Nano, the company has been insisting that ""decisions on product life cycle is a holistic view taken after considering the market developments, regulations and emerging competitive landscape. Any such decisions are announced as and when it's taken"".Company officials had, however, hinted that production and sales of the Nano would stop from April 2020 as Tata Motors has no plans to invest further on the model to meet strict emission norms under Bharat Stage-VI, which come into effect from April 1 this year and other safety regulations.The Nano was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to Rs 1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Tata insisting that ""a promise is a promise"".However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors' proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition. The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat.Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn't help its cause either. Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as 'the cheapest car'.It became a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even claiming that the Nano ""consistently lost value, peaking at Rs 1,000 crore"".Mistry also termed the Nano one of the ""legacy hotspots"" and there was ""no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, (or) any turnaround strategy""."

title,"Marico business update: Slowdown hits it hard, but margin holds up"
datetime,2020-01-03 17:15:00+00:00
description,None
content,"- Marico’s business update for the December quarter (Q3) of 2019-20 has proved to be a dampener of sorts for any expectations of sequential improvement in performance.Its category growth across personal care remained under pressure in the said quarter. India business suffered a marginal decline in volume growth due to softness in the hair oil segment. This is disappointing and misses our already low expectations. To put into perspective, volume grew 1 percent in Q2 FY20 and 5 percent in Q3 FY19.While the company has consolidated its market share in key franchises, de-growth in the hail oil industry continues. Going by the recent results, almost all the organised players (Dabur, Bajaj Consumer Care & Marico) in this space have been impacted.Among trade channels, traditional ones continue to face liquidity challenges. Though modern channels and e-commerce stayed strong, the business update suggests that these are also feeling the sales pinch.This, according to the company, is partly due to its specific price management measures to counter inter-channel conflict. Recently, FMCG companies have treaded with care in relation to urban trade channels such as Cash and Carry (Metro, Reliance and Walmart) as they provide heavy discount in lieu of higher offtake commitment. Though this channel can scale up fast, companies are turning conservative as there is a challenge to maintain price parity.Having said that, there are a few positive takeaways. Foods and allied categories fared relatively better. In Q2 FY20, foods franchise posted a strong value growth of 34 percent YoY (year on year), similar to what it achieved in Q1 (38 percent YoY).In other geographies, Bangladesh (46 percent of international business) stands out. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins are expected to improve compared to the previous year because of benign input cost. In Q3 FY19 and Q2 FY20, EBITDA margin was 18.8 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively.OutlookWhile analyzing this update, one should also note that towards the end of Q3 FY20, the FMCG player has taken marketing initiatives and pricing interventions in its key portfolio, which could show up in better volume growth in Q4 FY20.Though we acknowledge risk factors of competitive intensity, liquidity challenges for both urban and rural general trade and continuation of rural distress, the company is taking steps in terms of pricing interventions and incentivisation schemes for wholesale vendors.  Further, there are a few signs of improvement for rural demand on positive outlook for rabi crops.Further, margin profile remains strong and in the immediate term, it provides bandwidth to the company to position its products competitively and up advertising spend. The management’s decision to put the cost advantage to work for long term investments remains a crucial strategic move as it helps in reducing dependence on Parachute and Saffola and drive growth in the premium segments. In this context, we acknowledge that categories like male grooming, serums, hair nourishment and foods are expected to play a significantly higher share in the next five years.Finally, post recent correction after adjusting for near term estimates, the valuation appears attractive. Marico is trading at 35x FY21 estimated earnings which at a ~28 percent discount to the average multiple of tier 1 stocks in FMCG universe – Dabur, HUL, Godrej Consumer, Britannia and Colgate. We believe that given the long term outlook for an increasing diversified consumption story, the current valuation presents an accumulation opportunity on declines.Follow @anubhavsaysNone"

description,"Effective January 1, 2020, Paytm has started charging a fee of two percent if you load your wallet in excess of Rs 10,000 using a credit card during a month"
content,"Loading your Paytm wallet with more than Rs 10,000 a month? Be prepared to pay a fee.  Effective January 1, 2020, Paytm has started charging a fee of two percent if you load your wallet in excess of Rs 10,000 using a credit card during a month. However, there are no charges for  using debit cards or the unified payments interface (UPI) system.Paytm has sought to plug the small loophole of free credit. Here is what this means for you.Transferring borrowed moneyExperts in the payments space have observed that Paytm has noticed users loading their wallets using their credit cards and soon transferring the funds their bank accounts. This amount would then be spent or invested. In other words, the wallet user would take advantage of the 40-day interest free period available on credit cards.Paytm did not respond to our emails or phone calls.This is not the first time that Paytm has imposed a charge for credit card fund transfers. In March 2017, the firm announced that it would levy a two percent charge on adding funds to the wallet using credit cards. However, the company later withdrew these transaction charges stating that it would cause inconvenience to a majority of its customer base.In the same month, MobiKwik had said that it will continue to offer free loading of funds using credit cards. Sunil Khosla, Head Digital Business, India Transact Services Limited says, “Other wallet companies may introduce loading charges using credit cards after taking into consideration feedback from Paytm customers. They may charge for loading amounts more than Rs 5,000 or Rs 20,000 using credit card. It will be interesting to watch.”How does the charge work?Assume you add Rs 15,000 in your Paytm wallet using your credit card and as the first top-up in the month. A two percent charge on this means you pay Rs 300 extra, which goes to the firm. The remaining Rs 15,000 gets added to your Paytm wallet.However, if you add amounts into your wallet gradually, say, Rs 3,000, followed by Rs 4,000 a few days later and then Rs 3,000, you will not face any charges till you breach the free top-up limit of Rs 10,000. But in your last top-up, if you add Rs 3,001 instead of Rs Rs 3,000, a charge will be levied.Rajeev Agrawal, CEO of Innoviti payment solutions says, “Paytm seems to be monetising on the customer base it has built in the last couple of years and seeing whether they are ready to pay for the convenience offered.”Khosla says, “Most of the users should not be impacted since the limit of Rs 10,000 is enough to take care of day-to-day expenses, transportation costs, utility bills, etc.”"

description,These new launches come after a disastrous 12 months where almost each month saw negative growth
content,"Automakers have lined up at least a dozen launches in January, ranging from scooters to luxury cars as manufacturers become keen on starting afresh in the new year despite challenges at the retail end.Three of the 12 launches will be powered by battery electric motors, highlighting the growing trend towards India’s adoption of electric mobility sans requisite charging infrastructure support, which is still in developing stage.These new launches come after disastrous 12 months where almost each month saw sales going lower than corresponding sales of the same month of 2018. Several carmakers had to resort to redundancies, cut back in production and unscheduled halt in output.Tata Altroz, the premium hatchback rivalling Maruti Suzuki Baleno, will be one of the four all-new car model launches planned in January. The model expected to be priced under Rs 7 lakh is slated to be launched on January 22.Hyundai will launch the Aura compact sedan on January 21. This model, which uses the Grand i10 Nios platform powered by petrol and diesel engines, will complement the Xcent and is expected to be priced under Rs 6 lakh.Battered by the slowdown, Audi - India’s fourth largest luxury carmaker - will launch its flagship SUV Q8 on January 15. This will be the fourth SUV after Q3, Q5 and Q7 by the German giant in India. The vehicle is expected to be priced between Rs 1-2 crore.The last of the new model offerings is the MG Motor ZS EV (electric vehicle). The electric SUV was showcased by MG in December and is expected to be priced at under Rs 25 lakh.Mercedes-Benz CLA and GLE, Volvo XC40 T4 and Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza (petrol) are the upgrades or new variants expected to be launched in January.Bajaj Chetak and Tata Nexon (EV) are two of the three models that are powered by electric motors. Both the models had their unveiling ceremonies in November and December. While Chetak’s bookings will commence in January, Tata Motors opened the bookings for the Nexon EV in December.Powered by lithium-ion batteries, the 100km-range Chetak is expected to be priced around Rs 1 lakh whereas the 300km Nexon EV may be priced between Rs 15-17 lakh, making it the cheapest electric SUV in India.Two-wheeler buyers will also get to cheer with four new model launches happening in January. Honda, India’s second largest two-wheeler maker, will launch a model on January 15. This two-wheeler will be a Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) compliant model and will be likely christened ‘6G’.Chennai-based TVS Motor Company will also launch an all-new model between January 23-25.

title,Indo-China border dispute: Is a resolution finally on the cards?
datetime,2019-12-31 16:25:00+00:00
description,"Despite all the risks involved, India has agreed to consider China’s Sikkim proposal, provided they agree to resolves the middle sector dispute simultaneously."
content,"India and China have locked horns for decades over a land boundary dispute and resolution might just be underway. After national security adviser Ajit Doval’s meet with China’s state councillor Wang Yi in Delhi at the 22nd dialogue of the Special Representatives (SR), both countries decided to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Keeping that in mind, India has decided to consider the neighbouring country’s “early harvest” proposal to arrive at a consensus over the Sikkim land boundary. However, they will continue to do so only if the middle sector in Uttarakhand is also demarcated. Only then can the phased resolution of the border dispute be kick-started.Talks on this had begun way back in 2002 with both countries exchanging maps of the middle sector, but a long period of impasse followed marked with occasional skirmishes.NoneWhile the Chinese said the “early harvest” proposal was tabled in August 2019, the Indian leaders still considered demarcating border in Sikkim as a “low-hanging fruit”. However, the latter has now urged Beijing to show equal sincerity in solving the middle sector dispute, especially since the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is overshadowed by the dominance of the Indian Army and Bhutan Army in Chumbi Valley at present.Explaining the issue, a former Indian Army chief said: “The Sikkim proposal is not so simple. Any agreement on demarcation will be exploited by China to settle the boundary with Bhutan with an eye towards Doklam plateau. If India settles Sikkim, where it dominates both Chumbi Valley and Finger Area up in the north, then China will expand its Chumbi Valley area and increase pressure on West Bengal’s Siliguri corridor.”If the border dispute in Sikkim sector is settled it will directly affect Doklam, which saw heightened tension following a military stand-off in 2017. This, in turn, will make the India-China-Bhutan junction at Batang La vulnerable, further exposing the Siliguri corridor to PLA.Commenting on this, a China expert said: “If the Chinese get to Jhampheri ridge, then the entire Siliguri corridor becomes extremely vulnerable to the PLA. The lights of Gangtok are visible from Jhampheri ridge.”Despite all the risks, India has agreed to consider China’s Sikkim proposal, provided they agree to resolves the middle sector dispute simultaneously.Moreover, as India’s former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, explained, the early harvest proposal is in violation of a 2005 agreement on resolving boundary issues that clearly laid down that it needs to be a package deal."

title,25 years of WTO: Why Keynes would be a worried man!
datetime,2020-04-27 12:55:00+00:00
description,"The celebrated economist, according to a historian, would have turned in his grave, given the turbulence in world trade today"
content,"Amol AgrawalIn the beginning of this century, if someone had told me that 20 years from now, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will face an existential crisis, I would have laughed it off. How can such an international institution and that too dealing with trade, which is one of the pillars of economics, face an existential crisis?Moreover, in the early 2000s, the WTO was at the centre of the world economy with highly charged trade negotiations between member economies. But back then, I was naïve. I  have learnt over the years that the history of economics goes in circles and what was once in demand may not remain so in future.In 1944, a host of experts and government officials congregated in Bretton Woods, a town in Hampshire, US.  The talks were spearheaded by none other than John Maynard Keynes. The focus was on taking measures to resurrect the global economy from the destruction of two world wars and ensure future wars do not happen.Three institutional gaps were identified. First was financing reconstruction which led to the World Bank -- originally called the Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Second was fostering international cooperation from the financial side, which led to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The third was fostering international cooperation from the trade side which is the focus of this article.To promote trade, Keynes advocated establishing an International Trade Organisation (ITO). The original ITO charter was broader and apart from world trade included rules on employment, commodity agreements, restrictive business practices, international investment, and services. This required discussions and negotiations both with internal polity and governments of other countries. The ITO was to be ratified in 1947 in Havana.Meanwhile, 1945 onwards, 15 countries had agreed to foster international trade cooperation and initial negotiations affected $10 billion of trade. They did not want to repeat the mistake of protectionism of the 1930s which became one of the major factors of the Second World War. The group expanded to 23 countries by October 30, 1947, and it agreed to be part of the agreement named as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).In the Havana conference, the ITO charter could not go through as the US Congress did not agree to the trade deal.  The GATT signatories were visionary and had anticipated that the ITO might not be ratified and as a result, the GATT became the major instrument for world trade for nearly 50 years (1948-94). India became one of the earliest members of the GATT by signing on July 8, 1948.The GATT agreements were achieved by trade rounds (See Table). These rounds involved negotiations with signatory countries over lowering tariffs and then gradually expanding to other areas such as anti-dumping measures, non-tariff measures and so on.NoneThe GATT was based on a plurilateral approach, voluntary in nature, which is obviously a limitation as members can back out at will. The approach also takes a long time, given the voluntary nature. Thus, from the Uruguay Round onwards, the members started moving towards a multilateral approach in which all members are party to the agreement. Multilateral system also means one does not have to negotiate with multiple partners and an agreement applies to all with some reservations.The Uruguay round eventually led to the WTO. The organisation structure of the WTO is different from the IMF and the World Bank. The WTO is run by all the member governments (164 as of July 2016) where decisions are taken via various councils and committees. The smaller economies have an equal say in matters as bigger countries. In the IMF and the WB, power is delegated to a board of directors and is basically a power equation between the US and Europe, with Europe dominating the IMF and the US dominating the WB.The WTO taking the spirit of the GATT forward agrees to all trade developments via negotiations, which is no small task. The GATT covered goods whereas the WTO includes services and intellectual property rights. The organisation is headed by a Ministerial Conference (MC) which meets at least once every two years to take the trade negotiations forward. There have been 12 such MCs, with next slated in Kazakhstan in June 2020. The most significant moment for the WTO was China becoming a member in 2001. There were worries over China’s conduct in international trade, but those worries were unfounded.In 2008 crisis, things suddenly changed for the WTO. In fact, the fortunes of the IMF and the WTO reversed, with former rising and the latter falling. Despite a sharp decline in world trade and trade finance, the WTO has mostly been sidelined. The multilateral trade agreements were based on the global cooperation/consensus, but the 2008 crisis turned the tide. The high inequality and weak recovery has led to rise of economic nationalism and populism in developed countries of all places.The multilateralism has given way to bilateralism and regional trade agreements, negating years of progress. Shang-Jin Wei and Xinding Yu in a piece pointed out how WTO’s Dispute Settlement system, which was one of its biggest successes, is being killed as judges have not been appointed.  Once again, the US has been a spoilsport in much of these negotiations.In 2019, the IMF completed its 75 years. IMF historian Atish Ghosh wrote a fascinating piece “bringing” Keynes to visit IMF headquarters. Ghosh wrote how Keynes would be surprised by changes in the world economy, particularly transition from fixed exchange rates to flexible exchange rates and proud that the IMF has adapted to the changes and remains relevant -- though some may not agree.What would Keynes say of the WTO? He would be surprised that it took so long for the WTO to deliver, but still happy to note of the progress world economies have made under the GATT/WTO umbrella. He might show concern that post 2008 crisis, the world has increasingly turned protectionist. Some historians make references to how today’s times are similar to the end of the World War-I (1919), which would really worry Keynes (WW-3 was trending on Twitter recently). Keynes would say that it is exactly for such times that he had suggested creation of the ITO and unhappy that just in these times, the WTO has been sidelined!Keynes would remind the current world polity to be aware of the fateful history and work in all possible ways to ensure this history is neither repeated nor rhymed."

datetime,2020-01-03 18:56:00+00:00
description,"Digital advertising spends in the regional media space will reach $3 billion by 2023 from $300 million in 2018, according to a RedSeer report."
content,"Move over English! There are Indian languages now that can be described as languages of the web. And guess who is leveraging the country’s linguistic diversity? Brands, for whom “regional” is the go-to word to connect with consumers since both content creation and consumption in vernacular languages is seeing an upward trend.According to a RedSeer report, up to 30 percent of advertising spend is expected to come from Indian language ads.The report also estimates that digital advertising spends in the regional media will reach $3 billion by 2023 from $300 million in 2018.Among the content platforms betting big on regional languages is Momspresso, a place for mothers to express themselves. Sixty-five percent of content creation and 85 percent of the consumption on the platform is in regional languages.“For us, Uttar Pradesh is the second largest state in terms of number of users. The top six to seven states include Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and these states give you a sense of how big regional languages are. We have good amount of scale in terms of users coming in and consuming content in regional languages,” Vishal Gupta, CEO and co-founder, Momspresso, said in an interview with Moneycontrol.He added that the reason why brands are increasingly focussing on vernacular content is because nearly 60 percent of the audience trusts an ad in their own language.“The audience is Bharat,” he said.So, for Momspresso, Hindi is the largest, followed by Bangla, Marathi, Tamil and Malayalam.“Hindi is ahead of English. In terms of creation, both Hindi and English are roughly equal but if you were to look in terms of consumption, Hindi would be one and a half times of what English is,” said Gupta.Yet, Gupta says that brands are still catching up with the trend of leveraging regional language users and content. For example, on Momspresso, 30 percent of the revenue last year came from regional language content and users.But even now, English contributes about 70 percent to our revenue, said Gupta, who added that creating quality content in the regional space is relatively tougher. However, regional content has witnessed growth, as can be seen from the platform’s revenue from this segment in 2018, which stood at 13 percent.One reason for this growth could be that on a per unit basis, Momspresso prices the regional language content higher than the English content.For the platform, the biggest category is FMCG, followed by consumer durables and retail.Gupta is confident that the trend of brands focusing on regional language users is only going to increase.The optimism also comes from that fact that Google has estimated language content consumers to reach 536 million by 2021. “They (language users) are growing at a CAGR of 18 percent whereas English users are growing at a CAGR of 3 percent and are projected to reach 200 million by 2021.”"

It downgraded the short-term borrowings to A3 from A3+, the company said.""The downgrade reflects ASAL's operating performance during the first six months of fiscal 2020, resulting in operating losses and a 14 percent year-on-year decline in revenue. Lower offtake from key customers -- Tata Motors, Fiat India Automobiles and weak automobile demand may further lead to about 20 percent drop in revenue in fiscal 2020 along with continued weak profitability,"" the rating agency said.The downside impact on profitability and cash losses were arrested due to cost reduction initiatives and profit derived from the sale of non-core assets, it added.CRISIL said the losses were likely to be compensated through release from working capital due to lower revenue, incremental support from the parent, Tata Autocomp Systems and cash inflows from the sale of assets.According to the rating agency, new orders may lead to better revenue flow from fiscal 2021, thereby improving the scale and absorption of fixed costs.""Further, stabilisation of new programmes and steady growth in revenue should increase the operating margin over the medium term. Capital expenditure for the new orders to be executed during fiscal 2021 will be funded through debt and cash accrual. The lower-than-expected ramp-up in scale and profitability may further increase debt levels and hence will be closely monitored,"" it said."

Take a look.Brokerage: ICICI DirectNoneThe recent tariff hike has been a shot in the arm for the telecom industry, which was operating at sub-optimal average revenue per user (ARPU) after the new player’s entry three years back.We highlight that Airtel has raised tariffs by nearly 15-47 percent across packs from December 2019. The hike in tariff is likely to translate into FY21E revenue and EBITDA upgrade of about 9 percent and 17 percent, respectively,"" said ICICI Direct.The brokerage expects the price hike to result in increasing the monthly ARPU to Rs 155 against the current levels of Rs 127.The company has also announced plans to raise about $3 billion through a mix of debt and equity, which, the brokerage believes, is to meet the AGR dues demand within the stipulated time in case there is no relief from the Supreme Court or the government.""The fundraising intention assures that Bharti will survive given the availability of funds coupled with a price hike,"" said ICICI Direct.NoneThe bank is the eighth largest private bank on the basis of advances.

It is currently the sole authorised distributor of compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) in Mumbai, its adjoining areas and Raigad district, Maharashtra.Additionally, MGL’s planned Capex in Pen, Uran and Karjat areas provide visibility for volume growth in the medium to long-term.In the CNG segment, MGL plans to add 25 CNG stations per year for the next three years to the existing network of 244 CNG stations.Going forward, ICICI Direct estimates sales volumes at 3.1 mmscmd and 3.2 mmscmd in FY20E and FY21E, respectively.""We expect MGL to report healthy gross margins of Rs 14.6/scm and Rs 14.4/scm for FY20E and FY21E, respectively. Given the healthy margins and discount in valuation compared to its peers, we value MGL at 16 times P/E multiple,"" ICICI Direct said.NoneThe company’s growth has been driven by strong content as well as additional monetisation through F&B and ad revenues, which are margin accretive.For FY20 so far, the movie slate has performed exceptionally well and the content slate, going forward in the first half of the calendar year 2020, is also encouraging which should drive healthy box office collections ahead, said ICICI Direct.""We have built in healthy footfall growth of 11.8 percent CAGR in FY19-21E to 124 million screens and flattish ATP, which will lead to 15.6 percent FY19-21E CAGR in the net box office revenues to Rs 2,185 crore,"" said ICICI Direct.""The F&B tracking strong footfall and improving SPH is likely to clock 16.3 percent CAGR in FY19-21E.

Approximately 37 percent of the respondents were women, 63 percent were men. Around 41 percent were from metro/tier-1 cities, 37 percent from tier-2 cities and 22 percent were from tier-3 and rural locations.The $4 billion Indian diagnostics market, organised retail chains have a mere 15 percent market share. Hospitals have 37 percent while the rest belongs to the unorganised sector -- run by thousands of small standalone labs run by pathologists and lab technicians.Only one percent of over 100,000 path labs in India are accredited by the NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories). Many labs cut corners, by not practicing good laboratory practices, not employing pathologists, using cheaper reagents, and not adhering to best practices in collecting, transporting and storing blood samples. A large number of path labs survive by paying a cut to the doctors who refer patients to their labs.“The survey highlights the mistrust that citizens have with pathology labs and how according to people there is a strong need to address the doctor-pathology lab nexus on the ground through the formation of clear consumer protection rules and then driving enforcement of these rules via the local health and consumer departments,” LocalCircles said in a statement.The survey also stresses the need for implementing Clinical Establishment Act 2010 that emphasizes on minimum infrastructure that pathology labs should have but it has still not been adopted by many states."

title,World Gold Funds: Should you invest in them?
datetime,2020-01-06 09:35:00+00:00
description,These schemes invest in units of funds that invest in gold mining companies listed overseas.
content,"In 2019, those investors who had bet on gold have had a very satisfying year. Of all avenues to invest in gold directly or indirectly, Gold fund of funds have delivered the best returns. Only two funds are available in this segment in the Indian context – Kotak World Gold and DSP World Gold. These schemes invest in units of funds that invest in gold mining companies listed overseas.Over the last one year, these schemes have delivered 34 per cent on an average, easily outperforming most other asset classes, including equity mutual funds. In the same period, gold ETFs (exchange traded funds) managed only 21.8 per cent return as a category.Gold outperforms fundsKotak World Gold and DSP World Gold have been around for more than 10 years.NoneThough the recent performance may attract you into investing in these schemes, the long-term charts shown above don’t seem that encouraging. Gold as a commodity has done better than these two schemes. If you had invested Rs 100 in gold in June 2008, it would be worth Rs 316 now. During the same period, the Kotak fund would have become Rs 108, while the DSP scheme’s value would have declined by Rs 2.It is a good idea to own shares of gold mining companies when there is a boom in the yellow metal’s prices. “There is a strong correlation between gold mining companies and gold prices. Margins of gold miners expand with the rise in gold prices which leads to increase in the earnings potential of these gold mining companies,” says Anil Ghelani, SVP and Head – Product Management, DSP Investment Managers. A weak rupee vis-à-vis the dollar also means that the depreciation would benefit Indian investors as gold prices go up.“In the coming quarters, we expect that the broader trend for precious metals could continue to remain positive, but the momentum or pace of rally could be a little restricted. The pace of appreciation is expected to be slow as major concerns are now being factored-in by the market,” says Kishore Narne, Associate Director & Head Commodity Business, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Many are betting on steady rise in gold prices.Anuj Gupta, deputy vice-president – commodities and currencies at Angel Broking expects gold to trade in the range of Rs 40000 to Rs 42000 per 10 grams (USD 1550-USD1600 per ounce). Investment demand via ETFs, physical demand for gold, and geo-political tensions in the middle-east should support gold prices, he says.“Diversification of reserves and investment in gold is bound to increase in a world plagued with high uncertainty and policy irrationality,” said Chirag Mehta - Senior Fund Manager - Alternative Investments, Quantum Asset Management Company.Gold mining is a cyclical business and so fortunes would fluctuate.Cyclical and risky Gold funds do come with their share of risks. “This is a high risk-high reward investment option and only investors who are comfortable with high volatility should consider these funds,” says Anil Rego, founder and CEO of Right Horizons.Business risks include those pertaining to licenses, workforce availability and mismatch between expected and actual production.Governments could increase taxation and introduce restrictive environmental rules. These factors affect the profitability of gold miners.Sentiments in the equity markets also matter. “While the gold equities are positively correlated to gold prices, if the equity markets turn bearish, they could negatively impact the returns as the underlying investment is in equities as an asset class,” says Ghelani.Should you invest?“Gold should be looked at as a diversification strategy for black swan events and can be 5-10 per cent of the portfolio as per one’s choice,” says Abhishek Bisen, SVP & Fund Manager-Fixed Income, Kotak Mahindra AMC. Gold can offer some stability to portfolios in volatile times.“The possibility of a global slowdown and the leveraged balance sheets of governments globally warrant exposure to gold,” says Rego. He recommends investing around two to three percent of one’s portfolio in these schemes and exiting upon getting reasonable returns. Both entry and exit matter in sector funds.Also, a strong rupee can reduce your returns. Hence, you should account for currency risks.Being international funds, these schemes are treated as bond schemes. Long-term capital gains (on units held for more than three years) are taxed at 20 per cent after indexation. Short-term capital gains are added to your income and taxed at your slab rate."

description,"Amongst all the releases of 2019, Housefull 4 has taken the biggest start of them, while being next only to blockbusters like Baahubali: The Conclusion and Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and also a major family superhit, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. "
content,"NoneWhile it was quite apparent that there was a smear campaign (especially on social media) running against the film for at least one full week, all wagging tongues were silenced when the film was accepted by audiences in a really big way.Result? Just from Indian theatrical perspective, the film continued to earn big moolah, entered the Rs 200 crore Club, and in turn emerge as a superhit at the box office.NoneOne of the major barometers of a film's success lies in the kind of impressions that it gets on its satellite debut, and then the re-runs that follow. While one waits to see how the film does on its successive screenings, on its debut it has set a huge record.NoneOf course, the film's producer Sajid Nadiadwala as well as his leading man Akshay Kumar were always quite sure about the film's success, with Fox Star Studios backing it to the fullest. They waited patiently for the entire weekend of uncertainties before floodgates opened after Diwali. Their confidence and conviction in the film paid off theatrically and now even in its satellite launch which took place merely two months later, there have been excellent numbers recorded.NoneNoneHad the two launches been spaced out further and the film would have arrived first on satellite, the viewership would have been most definitely even bigger, and perhaps challenged the three biggies on the top."

content,"A copy of the Aadhaar card owned by 34-year-old Maharashtra techie Ameya Dhapre was uploaded online by miscreants years ago. The engineer from Girgaon had enrolled himself for Aadhaar back in 2012 itself, but his ordeals began three years later, in 2015 when cops came knocking at his door.Cops from Pune’s Mundhva police station came looking for him after a woman lodged a harassment complaint with them. The woman was reportedly being troubled by a man over phone calls, and the number led the cops to Ameya since the harasser had used the former’s Aadhaar card details to get his KYC done.NoneThis time he took more serious cognisance of the matter and wrote to the concerned bank authorities about a possible Aadhaar fraud. Suspicious, he decided to Google his name and was shocked to find out that a picture of his Aadhaar card had been shared by multiple websites.The techie immediately contacted the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) after the discovery and an official complaint was finally lodged. The UIDAI authorities, however, told Ameya that it won’t be possible for them to change his Aadhaar number and the only way out would be to cancel his card.However, Ameya was not willing to scrap his card altogether because it was linked to multiple accounts, as per UIDAI guidelines.In the meantime, he reached out to the cybercrime division of the Mumbai Police to file a complaint and seek redressal."

title,Six smart money management strategies for 2020
datetime,2020-01-01 18:21:00+00:00
description,You must chalk out a plan to deal with challenges that a weak economic environment brings in its wake
content,"NoneMoney is important. And the start of a new year is generally a good time to make some solid resolutions to manage your finances. While you need not take any giant leaps, you must start with some simple steps to manage your money well. Here are six simple measures.Continue to invest systematicallyMarkets have been volatile. In 2019, the S&P BSE Sensex delivered around 14 percent, but the BSE Midcap index lost two percent and the BSE Small Cap index fell six percent. In fact, just 15 of the Sensex’s 30 stocks contributed meaningfully; the rest of the companies’ shares gave mediocre returns or lost money in 2019. These are slim pickings and, quite naturally, our fund managers have been facing challenging times.But here’s some good news. According to a recent Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)-CRISIL study, the chance of your investments earning negative returns is nil if the holding period is five years. On the other hand, it is as high as 25 per cent if the horizon is just one year. It is always recommended that investors opt for equity mutual funds through systematic investment plans (SIP) with a horizon of five to seven years.Fortunately, investors understand this. In 2019, despite volatile markets, investors have continued with their SIPs. Monthly contributions through the SIP route stood at Rs 8,273 crore in November 2019, marginally up from Rs 8,246 crore in October.“There is no reason, especially for salaried employees with monthly cash inflows, to stop SIPs. If the money stays put in your savings account, it will not fetch returns capable of beating inflation,” says Amol Joshi, Founder, PlanRupee, a financial planning firm. If your equity SIPs are linked to long-term goals, then stopping SIPs would mean setting your financial plan back by years.Continue your SIPs in 2020 as well.NoneChoose your bank wisely, diversify The logic of opening a bank account just because the branch is at the ground floor of your residential apartment or right next to your society, has gone a toss. Most customers of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank had opened accounts in the bank because the branches were conveniently located and the staff served them with a smile over the years. The bank’s books, however, were allegedly cooked over the years and sadly the customers didn’t smell the stench till the bubble burst.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suspended the troubled bank’s operations, leaving lakhs of depositors in a lurch. Though it has eased restrictions on withdrawals over time, many depositors’ funds continue to be stuck. The biggest lesson of 2019: banks can also go bust.While we can agree that not many banks have gone bust over the years, the reality is that there are no guarantees. “For one, do not be swayed merely by the additional half or one percentage point interest rate. The financial strength of the bank should be the primary factor,” advises VN Kulkarni, former banker and financial counsellor. You could also look at spreading out your deposits across two or three banks. This will provide protection against a PMC Bank-like crisis, where the deposit insurance cover cannot be invoked at the moment as the bank is not facing liquidation yet.Switch to repo rate-linked loansNoneThe likes of Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda (BoB) had already slashed rates in November, in line with the central bank’s move. If you plan to take a fresh loan in 2020, the interest rate will be automatically tied to an external benchmark – as mandated by the RBI.While most banks have picked the repo rate as their external benchmark, Citibank has chosen Treasury Bill yields. If you had borrowed prior to October 1, 2019 (the date on which the repo-rate loan was made compulsory for new borrowers) and are servicing Base Rate or Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR), you should switch to RLLR, even if it means shelling out a one-time administration charge. “The new mechanism ensures transparency, which was lacking in the earlier interest rate regimes,” says Kulkarni.Get ready for your loan rates to move dynamically. A word of advice: if your loan rates go up, it’s best to pay a higher EMI and pay off your loan soon. Keeping the EMI constant and increasing your tenure (your bank could offer this choice) is false comfort. In the end, you will end up paying a higher amount as interest.Create a larger emergency corpusThe collapse of Jet Airways this year rendered thousands of staffers unemployed. While many were absorbed by other corporates, several others continue to grapple with loss of income. From leading comfortable lifestyles – and spending beyond their means in quite a few of these cases – they had to take to the streets and demand their unpaid salaries.A weak economic period such as the one we’re going through at the moment could throw some more shocks. And it pays to be prepared. In 2020, you must chalk out a plan to deal with such challenges. As a thumb rule, you must set aside at least six months’ household expenses in a secure, liquid instrument. This year, however, you could look at building a bigger contingency kitty. “Review your current situation, including health situation in the family, job scenario in your sector and goals that are approaching and increase the threshold, if required,” says Rohit Shah, CEO and Founder, Getting You Rich.The amount can be parked in fixed deposits or ultra-short-term debt funds. It must be capable of paying your monthly bills, EMIs, insurance premiums, mutual fund SIPs and children’s school fees for up to 9-12 months. “However, you need to take your personal situation into account. A double-income family can do without such a large kitty. However, if you are also taking care of your elderly parents, you need to create a dedicated emergency fund to cover their household as well as routine medical expenses,” says Pankaj Mathpal, Founder, Optima Money Managers.Buy adequate health insuranceInsulating your family against financial shocks that medical emergencies can bring about is yet another resolution you ought to make. Given the rising cost of healthcare expenses, a Rs 3-5 lakh health cover may not suffice. “A coronary bypass surgery can set an individual back by at least Rs 5-10 lakh, depending on the hospital and his medical conditions. The cost of cancer treatment will fall in the same range,” points out Nikhil Apte, Chief Product Officer, Royal Sundaram General Insurance. Many assume that their employers’ group scheme and a basic independent cover of Rs 3-5 lakh are adequate. “Many believe they will need higher covers only when they age and that they can enhance their sum insured later. What they do not realise is they will develop health issues as they age, making it difficult to increase the cover then,” he adds. It is best to buy a large cover when you are young and healthy.However, do not buy a single, large cover. Instead, opt for a base sum insured of Rs 5 lakh and add a top-up cover of Rs 10 lakh to your portfolio. You can look at critical illness covers too. The latter, typically, are fixed benefit plans where a pre-agreed sum is handed out upon diagnosis of the illness. It can be used to cover recuperation costs as also expenses not covered by your base policy. Critical illness policies that cover 10-15 ailments offer more comprehensive protection than disease-specific covers that take care of merely two-three ailments such as cancer, cardiac and renal failures.Protect yourself against fraudsNone"

title,Broke by month-end? Avoid taking payday loans to bridge the shortfall
datetime,2020-01-02 09:19:00+00:00
description,These are exorbitantly costly and can do more harm than good to your finances
content,"Dev AshishIf you required a small amount of money and I told you that I would lend you money at 360 per cent to 540 per cent per year, will you take such a loan?I am sure your response will be some version of ‘are you nuts?’But such lending is happening. And it is gaining popularity.India has been introduced to the concept of payday loans in recent years. These are ultra short-term, unsecured and (very) high-interest loans of small ticket sizes that fill the temporary gap in your cash flows. And these loans are multipurpose in nature. Like personal loans, you can use them for any purpose.Small loans, high interestThe loan amount can range between Rs 500 and a few lakh rupees. Most payday lenders customize the interest rate according to the borrower’s profile, credit history, amount being borrowed, etc. But, in general, the rates charged range between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent a day. In most cases, it is around 1 per cent a day. And this translates to 365 per cent a year! Now compare this with the so-called high-cost personal loans and credit card debts.But most borrowers don’t realize the exorbitant rates they pay because most loan tenures are limited to a month or so. Borrowers don’t annualize the rates. They buy the simple idea that it’s a small amount that they are borrowing, which they would clear by the next or the subsequent salary day. Another reason is that, many times, these lenders don’t mention interest rates but express it in rupee terms. So, if you borrow Rs 1000, you need to pay back Rs 1250 next month.You may ask as to how such high interest rates are even allowed? And is it even fair?It is best not to get into whether it’s fair or not. Nobody is forcing anyone to borrow from these payday loan lenders!Should you go for them?But all said and done, are these loans that bad?I would say that it’s a tool for solving temporary liquidity crunches for those who have no other option. And of course, it comes at an extremely high cost. So ideally, these loans should be taken (only after exploring all other options) just for dire emergencies. Many youngsters use them for regular purchases and discretionary spends, which is not right.I am pretty sure that once someone takes these loans and repays them, he/ she will be tempted to use this line of credit again very soon if he/she isn’t very disciplined.Payday loans do seem like access to easy credit. But they are not sources of secondary income. These are high-cost loans and it have to be repaid.And if you have to take these frequently, then the problem may lie elsewhere. Since emergencies don’t come every month, it’s clear that you are living beyond your means. This payday loan will not solve this actual problem.If borrowers aren’t careful, this line of high-cost credit can easily push them into a debt trap. Such loans should be avoided for discretionary spends. And even in case of emergencies, these payday loans should be used as the last resort when no other option works out.NonePayday loans should be treated as the last resort and not as the go-to option due to their convenient availability. These are exorbitantly costly and can do more harm than good to your finances."

title,Defaulted on loans? Follow these steps to get out of a debt trap
datetime,2020-01-01 09:28:00+00:00
description,"In case you default on loans or foresee such a possibility, the first step is to work closely with your financial planner and find a solution"
content,"Pune-based Vikas Manjekar, 29, would rather forget the dark days of January 2019, when he lost his job. Unfortunately, he couldn’t. At that time, he was repaying a personal loan of Rs 5 lakh, which he had taken a few months earlier, for his father’s medical treatment. To make matters worse, he had also borrowed Rs 10 lakh for his post-graduate education and was paying the equated monthly instalments (EMI) for the loan. From his monthly income of Rs 45,000, he was repaying Rs 22,000 in EMIs. He was the sole earning member in the family as his father was under medical care. “I used up my savings and investments in the first couple of months for my EMIs and then had to borrow from my friends and family members,” recalls Vikas.Vikas’ situation is not unique. According to a recent survey by CreditMate among two lakh borrowers across all states, for 36 per cent of the people, a delay in salaries and for 29 per cent, a business downturn (mainly impacting self-employed) were the two main reasons for debt defaults. These were followed by medical emergency in the family, at 13 per cent, and loss of job, at 12 per cent.The survey results show that several borrowers are in a risky financial situation at present and are wondering about the consequences of defaults on loan.Defaults come with consequencesA default simply means a borrower has not paid his EMI amount with interest to the concerned financial institution as per the loan agreement. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, banks consider default on loan after 90 days are completed of non-payment from a borrower.When Vikas defaulted, initially the financial institutions contacted him through email and mobile messages, asking him to repay. Vikas replied to these institution and said that he would repay immediately after he gets a job.  However, in the last couple of months the financial institution’s officials turned aggressive and debt collectors were visiting his home once a month as well as calling quite often from different numbers and using strong language to repay the loans. “This is worsening my mental health condition and now I am unable to focus on finding new job,” says Vikas.Aman Kapoor, Chief Engagement Officer at Credit Sudhaar says, “Defaulting on loans will have a deep impact on the credit score of the borrower. The person won’t be able to access credit from formal financial institutions; even if he/she manages to get a loan, the rate of interest will be high.”Now, several employers run a credit check before hiring employees. So, defaulting on loans can even impact your job prospects.Radhika Shah, CEO and Director of Aarvi insurance brokers says, “Also, when you default on loans or credit card dues and decide to buy an insurance policy, the insurance company may reject your application.”Effective October 1, banks charge a credit-risk premium over external benchmarks for calculating the effective interest rate on loans. Aparna Ramachandra, Founder Director of rectifycredit.com says, “This makes the credit score of borrowers an important factor in determining the interest rates on the reset date of the loans and banks may charge higher interest rates in case credit score deteriorates during the loan tenure due to default on credit card dues or other loans.”Talk to your bankDuring the tenure of the loan when you know that you’re about to default on loans due to any adverse circumstances, your best chance is to be proactive and contact your lending institution. Parijat Garg, credit scoring consultant says, “Explain the present conditions in detail to the lending institution. There is a possibility that your bank may restructure the existing loan by increasing the tenure and reduce the EMI burden or offer some other options.”  This will allow you more breathing room to get back on track and help maintain your credit score. “However, such terms of negotiation vary from bank to bank on the basis of relationship between the borrower and lender,” says Wilfred Sigler, Director of Sales and Marketing, CRIF High Mark.In September’19, Rahul Patel, 31, who is working in manufacturing company, received an email from the company that there will be salary cut by 15 per cent for all employees effective October’19. He was paying an EMI of Rs 10,000 for a car loan taken in May’19. He informed the lender about his financial condition.The bank understood his financial condition and agreed to charge only interest for six months on the outstanding car loan, with the condition that as and when he gets a new job (before six months), he should start repaying the regular EMI. In this financial arrangement, lending bank doesn’t mark your loan as a non-performing asset and your credit score is also not impacted. Says Ramachandra, “Always put such communications with your lender in writing.”Stop or reduce usage of credit cards If you lose your job or if there is salary cut initiated by your employer, stop or reduce using credit cards for day-to-day transactions. Kapoor cautions, “Regular use of credit cards with no income due to job loss or cut in income will lead to increase in credit card outstanding month-on-month. Carrying forward these outstanding amounts by paying only the minimum amount will lead to a vicious debt cycle.” Annually, you will pay an interest of 36 to 42 per cent per annum on the outstanding balance.Sell your dud investments and policies to repay loansIf you have an endowment policy and an outstanding loan, you would be paying a higher rate of interest on the loan as compared to the return you earn on the endowment plan. “Then, it makes sense to surrender the endowment plan or take the loan against the endowment plan and pay-off the loan. You will save substantially on interest being paid for the loan,” says Abhishek Bondia, the co-founder and principal officer of SecureNow.In case you have non-performing mutual fund schemes or unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs) that consistently underperform benchmark indices, sell them and pay-off the loan. It is a wise decision when you have outstanding loans for three years and more.You can also look at buying an insurance policy to cover your EMI payments in case of a job loss. For instance, Bajaj Allianz’s Loan Care takes care of up to three EMIs in case the policyholder’s employment is expressly terminated. However, do note that it will not come into picture if officially, the reason stated is voluntary resignation, which is generally the case in India. Some insurers also offer group covers that take on borrowers’ liabilities in case they default on repayments due to reasons beyond their control. These are usually offered through lenders, lending platforms and other institutions. Take, for instance, ICICI Lombard’s Group Secure Mind, which covers events like critical illness, job loss and accidental death or permanent disablement. In case of a job loss, the policy will take care of the borrower’s EMI payments during the policy period or till she regains employment, whichever is earlier. However, since this is a group cover, an individual cannot buy this product off the shelf.Moneycontrol’s takeIn case you default on loans or foresee such a possibility, the first step is to work closely with your financial planner and find a solution. You should not take on too many loans and go overboard with credit cards."

description,The regulator found that the company manipulated its financials and made announcement for buyback of shares even in the absence of adequate reserves.
content,"Sebi on December 31 barred four individuals of Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd from the securities market for two years and imposed restrictions on an auditor as well as a company secretary for manipulation of the company's financials and disclosure lapses. Chairman T Venkattram Reddy, Vice Chairmen T Vinayak Ravi Reddy and Parasuraman Karthik Iyer, and Managing Director N Krishnan have been restrained from the market for two years.Mani Oommen, Partner at C B Mouli & Associates, has been barred from rendering auditing services to any listed company for one year. Company secretary V Shankar has also been directed not to provide company secretarial services to any listed company for one year, Sebi said in an order.The regulator found that the company manipulated its financials and made announcement for buyback of shares even in the absence of adequate reserves.Liabilities of Rs 2,905.32 crore and interest and finance charges of Rs 753.91 crore were diverted from the books of the firm on the last date of every accounting year and were reintroduced to the books on the next day just to avoid disclosure of the same to the public, as per the 65-page order.The watchdog said there would be no proceedings against Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd -- the publisher of Deccan Chronicle and Asian Age newspapers, among others -- taking into consideration that Hyderabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved a resolution plan for the company, which was also compulsorily delisted from the BSE since August 2017.""...actions of the noticees are replete with glaring manipulations, fraudulent intents and exaggeration of accounts to the extent that it went on for a number of years with the connivance of the company secretary and auditors.""Such blatant and egregious misconduct on the part of the noticees is not conducive for the integrity of the securities market and cannot be spared to be viewed leniently, rather such misconduct of the noticees deserve to be dealt with strictly,"" Sebi Whole-Time Director S K Mohanty said in the order.The noticees are the individuals.During the financial year 2008-09, the firm understated its outstanding loans of Rs 1,339.17 crore. The differences between the actual and reported outstanding were Rs 2,982.07 crore and Rs 3,347.41 crore in 2009-10 and 2010-11, respectively.Additionally, the company made a buyback announcement at a price that was 234 per cent higher than the ongoing market price.The company and the individuals also concealed the series of encumbrances created on the promoters' shareholding in favour of financial institutions under the garb of non-disposal undertaking which were nothing but pledge agreements signed with these institutions and also failed to make such disclosures to shareholders, the order said.According to Sebi, the individuals blatantly made ""specious"" claims about the ownership of brands such as Deccan Chronicle and Andhra Bhoomi saying that these brands were owned by Deccan Chronicle Marketers (DCM) and not by the company. This was done only to accommodate their manipulative accounting adjustments and to waive financial obligations of Rs 2,905.32 crore which DCM owed to the company, it added.Sebi said the company, its directors and management in cahoots with its company secretary and auditor, have manipulated the accounts by understating the liabilities and expenditure over many years from 2005-06 onwards.""The attempt to buyback shares of the company by the directors and promoters based on the falsely reported reserves amount despite the company actually lacking the requisite free reserves was another attempt to hoodwink innocent investors and to sell the company's misplaced false story about its strong fiscal position to its shareholder/investors,"" it noted.The four individuals have also been prohibited from holding any managerial post or being associated directly or indirectly with any listed company that intends to raise money from the public, or any intermediary registered with Sebi for two years."

title,Explained: How to calculate yields on your bond investments
datetime,2019-12-30 10:08:00+00:00
description,You can calculate the yield using simple spreadsheet formulas
content,"Typically, we invest in bonds during their public issue. But, at times, we also consider bonds listed on the stock exchanges. The rate of interest (also known as the coupon rate) is an important criterion for investing. However, things are different when you buy bonds on the stock exchange. Although all listed (existing) bonds come with a published coupon rate, it is not the return that you would earn if you buy them.Bond prices fluctuate. Depending on when you buy the bond or sell it, the return that you earn would be different from the interest rate that the instrument carries. The return you earn is called yield to maturity (YTM). It’s important to know your bond’s yield; here is how to calculate it.Calculating yields“YTM is the true indicator of return on investment.  Generally, investors calculate current yield by dividing the coupon by the price of the bond, which will not give the right picture, as the price includes the premium and accrued interest. And on maturity, an investor will get the face value and not the premium,” says Vikram Dalal, founder and managing director of Synergee Capital Services.A bond quotes at a premium to the face value if there is a credit rating upgrade, fall in interest rates in the economy or positive investor perception. It can also quote at a discount if there is a rating downgrade, increase in interest rates, investor disinterest or lack of liquidity.If a bond has a call option, which allows the issuer to redeem the bond early, you should calculate the yield to the date of call option as a prudent measure, assuming the bond will be called back.The trading detailsNoneYou can click on any specific issue and view the details. For example, Shriram Transport Finance’s NCD is a bond that offers a coupon of 9.12 per cent, payable monthly. The date of maturity is November 2, 2023.Once you know this information, you need a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) to compute the yield on the bond.Key in the data as shown in the screenshot below. The date column will specify the dates of the cashflows. The payout column mentions the absolute interest amount. On the date of maturity, the cash receipt will include the principal of Rs 1000 and the interest payout for that month.NoneNow key in the formula of XIRR as shown below. XIRR used to calculate returns on investments made at different points of time. It is used to calculate returns when there are multiple cashflows – be they investments or redemptions spread over a period of time.NoneIn the above example, 10.67 per cent is the YTM for the bond. Since the bond has a monthly payout, the accrued interest part has been ignored. Otherwise, the yield would be a bit lower.“Investors must take into account the accrued interest while calculating the YTM,” says Joydeep Sen, founder and CEO of wiseinvestor.in. In the case of annual interest payouts, this accrued interest needs to be considered. For example, in the case of a bond with face value of Rs 1000 and annual interest payout of 12 per cent, if you are computing the YTM at the end of the 10th month, the fair value of the security would stand at Rs 1100."

Needless to say, through the claim.But, do you have health insurance?NoneLet’s face the truth, you can’t predict ailments, diseases are increasing and so are medical treatments. As per The Lancent and its associated journals, India saw an alarming increase in heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancers in the past 25 years, between 1990 and 2016. Also, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that India had the highest number of diabetics at 50.8 million till 2018 and estimated that the number will reach 73.5 million by 2025.Talking about treatment costs, as per the Economic Survey of India 2019, there was a steep rise in healthcare goods and services such as doctor’s fees, medicines, and more.Yet, there are few takers of health insurance and the numbers are startling. The overall insurance penetration in India reached 3.69% in 2017, and as per a report by Milliman titled ‘Indian Life and Health Insurance Sector’, out of 1.3 billion people in India, only 44% had a health insurance policy as of 2017.So, what choice do you make—Bima ya Bimari?To raise awareness about the criticality of health insurance, government and the private sector are taking several initiatives and reaching out to people in metros, Tier-II and Tier-III cities. Companies such as Reliance General Insurance (RGI) are making health insurance accessible to all by introducing several schemes and launching attractive features.For instance, through RGI, you can pay premiums for adequate health insurance in four easy instalments. The insurer has even introduced a 5% discount for girl child and independent women.NoneMoreover, you get tax benefits on health insurance under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act.In a nutshell, there are various benefits of health insurance and since it’s being made affordable, it is a good time to get a policy and add a safety net around yourself and your loved ones. This is a partnered post."

content,"The West Bengal unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad on Tuesday demanded a high-level inquiry into Sunday evening's violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and said the probe could be held under the supervision of the Supreme Court.Terming the clash ""unfortunate"", ABVP state president Saptarshi Sarkar alleged that the violence was the handiwork of Leftitst forces who want to destabilise the situation in the JNU.More than 35 students and faculty members were assaulted on Sunday evening after masked men armed with sticks and iron rods went on a rampage inside the campus of the institute.The Left-controlled JNU Students Union and the ABVP are blaming each other for the violence. The Delhi Police is now probing the incident.""Whatever happened in the JNU is unfortunate but there is a lack of clarity in the chain of events. We demand a high-level inquiry into the incident,"" Sarkar told a press conference here.Asked who will conduct the probe, the ABVP leader said, ""Any competent authority at the highest level. It can also be held under the supervision of the Supreme Court.""He claimed that 25 ABVP members including its university unit secretary Manish Jangid were injured in the January 5 incident at the JNU, but that has not been highlighted.The leader of the RSS' student wing said the organisation believed that Leftist forces were behind the violence in order to destabilise the situation in the JNU on the pretext of protesting against fee hike.""They want to vitiate the academic atmosphere in the JNU and other universities like the Jadavpur University where they have organisations,"" Sarkar said.He also flayed the SFI, the student's wing of the CPI (M), for allegedly steering its rallies from streets towards offices of political opponents and setting ablaze the flag of a political party.Sarkar was referring to a students' rally, the participants of which tried to march towards the BJP state headquarters on December 20. The procession was organised to protest against the amended Citizenship Act.A flag of the saffron party was also allegedly set on fire by the Students Federation of India (SFI) activists during a rally at Jadavpur area here on Monday.""Do they call it a democratic protest? In what kind of agitation the flag of a political party is set ablaze?"" Sarkar asked.ABVP state unit Assistant Secretary Shyamashree Karmakar said, while the Jadavpur University unit of the SFI was talking about democracy and liberal values, its leadership has been accused of practising gender discrimination.She quoted reports published in a section of media that over 30 members resigned from SFI's Jadavpur University unit citing lack of action against charges of sexual harassment, discrimination based on gender and caste and taunting for smoking cigarettes.Sarkar said while West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was quick to issue a statement after the JNU incident and send a Trinamool Congress delegation there, she had not uttered a word condemning the death of two students ""in police firing"" at Daribhit in the state and the attack on 144 ABVP activists in recent times.Two students were killed in a clash over recruitment of Urdu and Sanskrit teachers in a school at Daribhit in North Dinajpur district in 2018."

description,"Besides natural factors, arson is also suspected as a cause of some of the recent fires. The NSW Police Force has taken legal action against more than 180 people for bushfire-related offences since late 2019"
content,"Australia has been battling with one of the worst bushfires in its history. The blazes have been burning across Australia since September 2019, scorching homes, destroying entire towns and turning daytime skies orange, red and black.Over eight million hectares of land – an area the size of Ireland — has burned in this year's bushfire season, claiming at least 26 lives and damaging hundreds of homes and buildings across several parts of southern New South Wales, northern and eastern Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, according to officials.NoneWhile the fires have touched every state in Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have been hit the hardest. Thousands of residents and tourists have been forced to flee or take shelter as flames ravaged towns in the regions.Around 23 fires are still burning in Victoria, according to the state's emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp.NoneSo, what is a bushfire?Bushfires and grassfires are common throughout Australia. Grassfires are fast-moving, passing in five to ten seconds and smouldering for minutes, while bushfires are generally slower-moving, but have a higher heat output. This means they pass in two to five minutes, but they can smoulder for days. Fire in the crown of the tree canopy can move rapidly.NoneA fire front advances more quickly when travelling upslope and slows travelling downslope. The speed of a fire front advancing will double for every 10 degrees increase in slope, so that on a 20-degree slope, its speed is four times greater than over flat ground.History of Australian bushfiresBushfires are an intrinsic part of Australia's environment. Natural ecosystems have evolved with fire, and the landscape, along with its biological diversity, has been shaped by both historic and recent fires.Australian bushfires have resulted in over 8,000 injuries and 433 fatalities, close to 50 percent of all deaths from major Australian natural disasters (excluding heatwaves) in the period between 1967 and 2013. Over this same period, bushfires cost approximately A$4.7 billion (excluding most indirect losses), as per the data shared by the Australian government.Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster was ""Black Saturday"" in February 2009, when some 180 people died in Victoria.What caused 2019 bushfire?Each year, there is a fire season during the Australian summer, with hot, dry weather making it easy for blazes to start and winds make them easy to spread.This fire season began in warmer months and exacerbated by persistent heat, lightning strikes in drought-affected forests.NoneNoneIndia connectionNoneNoneSmoke travelling beyond AustraliaNoneNoneLet alone Australia, the smoke from bushfires raging across Australia reached Brazil, an arm of the National Institute for Space Research said on Twitter. Referring to satellite images, the agency's Department of Remote Sensing said the smoke had arrived in Brazil's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, on January 7.NoneNoneChile's meteorological service said on January 6 that smoke from the fires was visible in Chile and Argentina.That means the hazy cloud of smoke, sitting at about 6,000 metres (20,000 feet) in the air, travelled more than 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) to reach South America.None500 million animals killedNoneNoneThe total number of animals affected nationwide could be as high as a billion, according to Christopher Dickman, the University of Sydney ecologist who led the report.NoneWhile many wild animals and some farm animals are said to be killed directly by the flames, other animals have faced death due to destruction of their natural environment, which they rely on for food and shelter.NoneWhat is being done to stop the fires?The authorities are evacuating residents to safety and trying to stop the fires from spreading. There are hundreds of thousands of volunteer firefighters, who have been working around the clock to try and bring the fires under control for months.NoneOn January 9, authorities issued fresh warnings and evacuation orders in the country's southeast as hot and windy conditions threatened to regenerate huge bushfires.NoneWhy has PM Scott Morrison’s government been criticized for its response?Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing widespread criticism for his handling of the crisis.Morrison’s administration faced criticism for thwarting global efforts to settle the rules of the Paris Agreement during a United Nations conference in Madrid in December.Morrison also faced backlash for taking a vacation to Hawaii in the midst of the fires. The PM had cut short the trip and apologised to people.Australia is on fire. And the summer there has only just begun. 2019 was a year of record heat and record drought. Today the temperature outside Sydney was 48,9°C. 500 million (!!) animals are estimated dead because of the bushfires. Over 20 people have died and thousands of homes have burned to ground. The fires have spewed 2/3 of the nations national annual CO2 emissions, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The smoke has covered glaciers in distant New Zealand (!) making them warm and melt faster because of the albedo effect. And yet. All of this still has not resulted in any political action. Because we still fail to make the connection between the climate crisis and increased extreme weather events and nature disasters like the #AustraliaFires That has to change. And it has to change now. My thoughts are with the people of Australia and those affected by these devastating fires. (Photo: Matthew Abbott for The New York Times)NoneNoneNone“500 million (!!) animals are estimated dead because of the bushfires. Over 20 people have died and thousands of homes have burned to ground,” she wrote, adding “And yet. All of this still has not resulted in any political action. Because we still fail to make the connection between the climate crisis and increased extreme weather events and nature disasters like the #AustraliaFires. That has to change. And it has to change now.”Pope Francis also accused world leaders of failing to listen to the concerns of youngsters pushing for global action against climate change. In his annual speech to Vatican diplomats on January 9, the pontiff said climate change was a ""concern of everyone,"" despite a tepid response from the international community.Consequences of Australian bushfireThe consequences of the unprecedentedly catastrophic bushfire will be seen even after the fires are out.The calamity has created a wave of homeless people whose houses have been burnt to ashes.NoneBesides being homeless, they would face water crisis due to disruption in water supply infrastructure as they reportedly burned in the regions affected by the bushfire.Meanwhile, efforts are on to help the affected population. Free sheds and patchwork shelters are being built for those with nothing left.Star tennis players like Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal are also doing their bit to help the people in Australia, reported news agency IANS. They will feature in an exhibition match on January 15, five days before the start of the Australian Open to raise money for a relief fund."

He is a former General Electric and Nielsen executive with a reputation as a turnaround specialist.Calhoun, 62, will get a base salary of $1.4 million but potentially several million more in bonuses and stock awards, including $7 million if he gets the Max back in service.The Max was grounded last March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. It has taken far longer than Boeing expected to fix the plane. This month, Boeing will halt production until it is clear when changes to the plane will be approved by regulators.Muilenberg was named CEO in 2015 and presided over a rapid rise in the Chicago-based company's stock price. The shares have dropped 26% in the last 10 months, however, as Max's recovery stalled.Months before Muilenburg's ouster, some lawmakers and relatives of passengers who died in the Max crashes had asked him to resign or take a cut in pay."

description,"As many as 23 brands who are associated with Deepika Padukone including Tanishq, Tetley Green Tea, L'Oreal Paris have so far not snapped ties with her. "
content,"Deepika Padukone’s visit to Jawaharlal University (JNU) to show solidarity with students who were attacked by a mob on January 5 has started many discussions, one of them being the impact of the move on her brand value.While many brand experts say that her stand on JNU could lead to loss of brands, the scenario could be otherwise.According to Vinay Kanchan, brand storyteller and innovation catalyst and author of Sportivity, “While everything a celebrity does affects their brand value, it is important to remember that most of these things are blips. So, they do not have long-term impact on brand value of a celebrity who has a very strong brand equity like Deepika Padukone.”“I believe these things are topical. So, once the furore over this dies, it will be forgotten. Public memory is extremely short. Hence, her hardcore fans will stick with her,” he added.NoneNoneNoneTrade experts say that the film is doing well in multiplexes or urban sectors. The film’s subject is such that it will attract a niche audience and is not for masses or single screens. The movie, which is based on the life of an acid attack survivor, will not qualify as a big-screen entertainment for many. Yet, the film is holding ground.In fact, Kanchan pointed out that Deepika is someone who speaks to the young, modern, urban population. “There is an urban skew to her the way she conducts herself. She is social media savvy and a woman of the new era. So, a lot of younger people even if they disagree with her would appreciate the fact that at least she showed the guts to go and act,” he said.Plus, he is of the opinion that one aspect in the brand equity that is exceedingly becoming very important is authenticity.“It is high time that celebrities took stands in India. If there is one thing the younger people will look up to is authenticity. These people are playing roles where everything is scripted for them. There are few moments where you see the real person and what that person stands for,” he added.Hence, Kanchan felt that many of Deepika’s brands will stick with her. “Most of the brands are new age brands. Unless the issue is blown out of proportion, I don’t see it affecting her,” he said.And so far, none of the brands that Deepika is associated with has snapped ties with her. Padukone, who is the face of several brands, including Tanishq, Tetley Green Tea, L'Oreal Paris, as well as her own fashion brand All About You, currently has around 23 brands in her portfolio.In fact, Kanchan believes that people who were not considering her, might now take notice now that she is taking a stance. “There is a new breed of entrepreneurs who do not mind taking on a bit of controversy. And there might be such brands who would discover Deepika,” said Kanchan.He also thinks brands should always take stances. “The more polarizing your stance is, the stronger you are as a brand. Getting into controversy in many ways adds to the brand value,” he said.This is similar to how controversies around stars or films actually benefits the movie’s business.Plus, Deepika is no small name both at the box office or in the endorsement space.It was Padukone who was the only female celebrity at rank four in the Forbes India celebrity 2018 top 10 list with earnings to the tune of Rs 112 crore."

content,"The Supreme Court has stayed the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order reinstating Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons executive chairman, observing that there were 'lacunae' in the orders passed by the tribunal.The apex court observed that the tribunal 'seems to have committed errors in adjudicating and seems to lack powers to pass the directions that it has' and that it will 'have to hear the matter in detail'.A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant said there was no prayer in the petition for reinstatement of Mistry but the tribunal went ahead with it and ordered his reinstatement.  ""We find there are lacunae in the judicial orders passed by the NCLAT,"" the bench said issuing notices to Mistry and others.The court was hearing a petition filed by Tata Sons (TSPL) challenging the tribunal’s decision restoring Mistry as executive chairman of the Tata Group.TSPL has challenged NCLAT’s December 18 decision that gave a big relief to Cyrus Investments and Mistry, restoring him as the executive chairman of TSPL, and ruling that the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as the head of the holding company of the $110-billion salt-to-software conglomerate was illegal.The bench posted the matter after four weeks.But in a relief to Mistry, the top court ordered the Tatas to not exercise power under Article 25 of the Company Law for pushing out shares of minority holders in the company. The bench said no effort has been made to make the Pallonji Group dilute their shareholding.Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for the company Cyrus Investment Pvt, submitted that instead of staying the NCLAT order, notice should be issued and two weeks be given for filing the reply.However, the bench said, ""Our first impression is not good about the order of the tribunal. The tribunal granted the prayer, which was not prayed.""The Mistry's side wanted to place a note about interim arrangement which was not accepted by the bench. Senior advocate NK Kaul appeared for Mistry while senior advocate Shyam Divan was appearing for the shareholders which were on Mistry's side.During the hearing, Sundaram said he was not pressing for the consequential relief of reinstatement of Mistry but was against the wrongful removal of Mistry from Tata. He said Mistry wants his nominee to be placed on the Tata Sons board.Senior advocates AM Singhvi, Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Mohan Parasaran represented the Tatas."

content,"NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneBuxar Jail also supplied the rope for 2001 Parliament Attack convict Afzal Guru, 1993 Bombay blasts convict Yakub Memon and 26/11 Mumbai terror attack convict Ajmal Kasab.Why this unique monopoly?Buxar Jail was set up by the British in 1880, and in 1884, they brought a machine to the jail to manufacture hanging ropes.  Before that, it was imported from Manila, in the Philippines, hence the name Manila Rope is popular for this grad of noose.Later, the India Factories Act gave Buxar Jail the exclusive right to manufacture these hanging ropes, prohibiting others from doing so.Is hanging rope different from other ropes?Hanging rope is different from other ropes, in that it is soft, yet very strong. It is believed that the task was given to Buxar Jail by the British keeping in mind the climate and availability of water near the jail.Buxar Jail is located on the banks of the Ganga and also has a well, an uncommon feature in jails so as to prevent inmates from committing suicide.A particular type of yarn, called J-34, is used to make the hanging rope. The cotton for this yarn is cultivated in Punjab.Who makes the hanging rope?Buxar Jail has 4-5 employees who train inmates (excluding death-row convicts) to manufacture the hanging rope.The J-34 fibres are first braided into yarns; 154 such yarns are then woven to prepare 154 braids. Six such braids are used to make the hanging rope. A lot of water is used at each stage to ensure that the rope is soft."

datetime,2020-01-08 18:04:00+00:00
description,The service will be enabled pan-India between January 7 and 16 and will allow Jio users to make or receive calls over Wi-Fi using their existing Jio number.
content,"Telecom giant Jio announced the nationwide rollout of voice and video over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi) services on Wednesday. The service will be enabled pan-India between January 7 and 16 and will allow Jio users to make or receive calls over Wi-Fi using their existing Jio number.The move follows Bharti Airtel, which launched its own VoWiFi service last month. However, Airtel has restricted the service to users who have subscribed to Airtel Xstream Fiber, its fiber-based broadband service, unlike Jio which allows users to make calls over any Wi-Fi connection, including any public Wi-Fi.To the uninitiated, VoWiFi is a Wi-Fi-based VoIP service, which allows users to make calls even in places with poor or no cellular network. Additionally, calls made over VoWiFi provides users with a shorter call connection time along with superior call quality compared to calls made over VoLTE or any existing cellular technology.The service can be availed by any user who has an active Jio tariff plan and a compatible device. The user will not incur any additional charges for using the service.Commenting at the launch of this service, Akash Ambani, Director, Jio, said “At Jio, we are constantly innovating to enhance customer experience or solve their problems. At this juncture, when an average Jio consumer uses over 900 minutes of voice calls every month, and at a growing base of consumers, the launch of Jio Wi-Fi Calling will further enhance every Jio consumer’s voice-calling experience, which is already a benchmark for the industry with India’s-first all VoLTE network.”Here’s how to enable the service on your phone:NoneNoneiOs users should head to Settings -> Look for Wi-Fi Calling -> Switch on the ‘Wi-Fi Calling on This Phone’ option."

title,Sales of German luxury car brands hit their lowest levels in three years
datetime,2020-01-10 19:38:00+00:00
description,"Mercedes, BMW and Audi posted sales of 28,021 units in 2019, a slump of 26 percent compared to 2018. "
content,"Sales of luxury cars may have dipped to their lowest in three years due to multiple increase in prices and a slowing economy.Mercedes, BMW and Audi together control more than 80 percent of all luxury cars sold in India.They posted sales of 28,021 units in 2019, a slump of 26 percent compared to 2018 when they sold 37,702 units.Two other companies who are part of the same league – Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo – did not reveal sales figures for 2019 at the time of publishing this article.Despite severity in slowdown, Mercedes-Benz retained the top spot for the fifth consecutive year. It recorded a fall of 11 percent to 13,786 units in 2019. In 2018, the Daimler-owned brand had sold 15,538 units.""We are satisfied with our sales performance in 2019 despite facing strong macro-economic headwinds, specifically in the first three quarters. We were able to create a strong growth momentum in the market during the festive period and we are glad to carry it for the rest of the year. Our growth in our Q4 sales is a testament of this fact,"" said Martin Schwenk, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India.In the October-December period (including festive days), Mercedes recorded a growth of 3.3 percent. During these three months the company launched three new models, G 350d, V-Class Elite and GLC.Audi witnessed a fall that was the worst in ten years. The German company, that was once the top luxury car maker in India in sales, posted a decline of 29 percent to 4,594 units in 2019.""The auto industry faced strong headwinds in 2019. Economic slowdown in India last year tapered customer sentiment and potential car buyers delayed their buying decision. It was a challenging year as there was ambiguity about the life of BS-IV vehicles on-road in the customer’s mind and an anticipation for GST reduction on cars; both of these topics were later clarified by the Government. The year also saw the tightening of loans availability to dealers and customers, which negatively impacted the sales of luxury cars,"" Audi India said .Balbir Singh Dhillon, Head of Audi India, said: ""At Audi India, we are  optimistic about the growth of luxury car segment for many years on the back of the India growth story; which still remains intact. We believe that the luxury car market will take a leap jump sometime in the future, we only don’t know when. In terms of growth estimates for the luxury car market, we estimate it to remain flat in 2020 and we are hopeful of positive growth / revival starting 2021”.BMW held on to its second spot with sales of 9,641 units, a fall of 13 percent as against 11,105 units posted 2018. BMW India saw a significant contribution of over 50 percent coming from the locally-produced sports activity vehicle range including the BMW X5, the BMW X3 and the BMW X1. A strong contribution also came from the BMW 5 Series and the BMW 3 Series."

title,"Equity MF inflows in December back in shape, SIPs do all the talking"
datetime,2020-01-10 19:48:00+00:00
description,The gradual shift of household savings away from physical to financial assets and the increasing share of MFs in part explain the stellar AUM growth
content,"The assets under management (AUM) of India’s mutual fund (MF) industry tell a story.That is, the AUM figure stood at Rs 26.5 lakh crore as of December-end 2019, an increase of 10 percent from a year ago, data released by AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) on Wednesday showed. On a month on month basis, it declined by 1.5 percent in December.Net inflow for the sector came in at Rs 1,394 crore as against Rs 802 crore in November.  Liquid funds bore the brunt with large outflows while equity funds – the most awaited and a key data point – saw encouraging inflows.Tracking AUM fortunesThe AUM graph has grown from strength to strength. From Rs 10.5 lakh crore as of December-end 2014 to Rs 26.5 lakh crore at the end of December 2019, it has more than doubled in 5 years.No wonder, asset management companies (AMCs) had a dream run in 2019. The stock price of two listed asset managers – HDFC AMC and Reliance Nippon – more than doubled, too.NoneThe gradual shift of household savings away from physical to financial assets and the increasing share of MFs in part explain this stellar AUM growth. The trend, referred to as “financialisation of savings”, got a leg-up after demonetisation, translating into a sharp jump in inflows for the MF industry.Outflow in liquid funds But liquid and overnight market funds are not that lucky. They saw outflows of Rs 80,000 crore in December because of seasonality issues. Fund houses usually see redemptions in December as corporates that are active investors in liquid funds tend to redeem their liquid investments to meet advance tax payment deadline.Equity inflows shape up, but much below the peak Inflows into equity funds, including closed-ended schemes, jumped to Rs 4,432 crore in December, from Rs 933 crore in the previous month.Monthly net equity inflows have come off significantly from the peak of Rs 20,308 crore in November 2017. However, the underlying trend continues to be very healthy.NoneThe rising SIP momentumThere is one trend that clearly stands out. Investment in equity funds through systematic investment plans (SIPs), which tend to be relatively sticky, continued to improve, given the highest-ever mobilisation at Rs 8,518 crore for December. This compares well with SIP flows of Rs 8,273 crore in November and is a positive sign, indicating buoyancy in retail flows.While the overall equity flows have been on a shaky pitch, the MF industry has not seen rise in cancellation of SIPs.NoneThe stability in SIP’s contribution is the key success story of MFs. Going by the current SIP monthly run rate of above Rs 8,000 crore, the industry will receive equity inflows of at least around Rs 1,00,000 crore in 2019-20, which is sizeable enough.SIPs also have played a key role in bringing smaller investors into the MF fold. Individual investors now hold a higher share of MF assets at around 54 percent of total AUM as of November-end, according to AMFI.Various marketing initiatives and investor awareness campaigns such as ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ by AMFI have further popularised MFs.Most importantly, progressive reforms and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) such as introduction of direct plans, capping of fees charged by MFs to investors, standardization of MF schemes and disclosures have been strong growth drivers.Overall, MFs continue to break new ground in the financial services sector, making investor capital a key pivot for the country’s growth machinery."

content,"NoneNoneSteep valuationAfter the latest fund raising, Biocon Biologics alone now constitutes about 60 percent of parent Biocon's market capitalisation of around $5 billion. The contract research subsidiary Syngene, excluding minority shareholders stake, is valued at $1.4 billion and the residuary business of Biocon business, that includes small molecules and domestic formulations, is now valued at $600 million.Analysts estimate the valuation of Biocon Biologics at more than 10 times, with anticipated revenues of Rs 2,000 crore in FY20. Biocon's revenue at the end of FY19 was at Rs 5,658.8 crore, of which 27 percent or Rs 1,528 crore was contributed by the biologics division.The steep valuation of a subsidiary that wasn't in existence just a year ago has come as a surprise. Biocon Biologic was carved out as subsidiary, with research and development, manufacturing and distribution functions of biosimiars in April last year.The company said this was done to create a vertically integrated biologics company, with an intention to unlock value and give investors a pure-play investment opportunity in biologics.The company did the same for its contract research arm Syngene, by raising private equity money and then followed by an IPO, giving exit to the investors. Syngene, which was listed in August 2015, raised Rs 550 crore. The IPO was subscribed 32 times. Incidentally, True North was an investor in Syngene before it was listed.Biosimilar story unfoldingAnalysts say the valuation is based on the expectation of Biocon delivering its biosimilar growth story.The company has set an aspiration target of $1 billion by FY22 for its biologics division.The company has a product pipeline of 28 molecules, including 11 with Mylan, several with Sandoz, and is developing many independentlyThe US launches of biosimilar drugs trastuzumab and insulin glargine (approval expected in March 2020), continued growth in existing developed and emerging markets, the launches of insulin aspart and bevacizumab in various markets, and enhanced of market share of biosimilars are the key levers that the company is banking on to achieve a $1 billion target.But some analysts are cautious about the valuation; and revenue projections Biocon is making.""We expect another round of PE investment in the company that could result in Biocon stake dropping to 90 percent before a potential listing of the subsidiary over the coming 12-24 months,"" said Kotak Securities in its latest research note."

content,"The Reserve Bank of India, on January 9, has amended the Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines to allow banks, lending companies and fintech startups to onboard customers remotely. It has allowed for the video-based KYC of customers of financial institutions, thereby incorporating the changes made to Prevention of Money Laundering rules by the central government.Doing away with mandatory physical documentation and in-person verification, the central bank has allowed for the use of a live photo of the customer, and his or her officially valid document as a proof of identification. It has also mandated for the geo-tagging of the customer's video to ensure that they are located within the borders of the country.RBI has not only allowed KYC documents to be submitted electronically, but also given the green light to accept digitally signed documents, and documents issued to the digital locker account of the customer, as proof for the opening of an account. A Digi-Locker, as it is popularly called, allows citizens to store their personal documents online.“This is a good start to the new year,” said Rudrajeet Desai, founder of WorkApps, which offers a video KYC solution to banks and other financial institutes. “This will definitely drive financial inclusion and help strengthen the country’s economy.”Others like Saru Tumuluri, CEO of Khosla Ventures-backed Veri5Digital said that the general direction the RBI is taking by allowing the use of Video ID for KYC is extremely positive and shows its commitment towards digitisation and financial inclusion.“Though there is still some clarity that would be required in terms of the actual use, one thing is certain that use of offline Aadhaar-based KYC, along with, video ID KYC, would drive an upward trend in the financial sector,” said Tumuluri.With respect to the use of Aadhaar, while banks can still use online Aadhaar verification in case of customers who agree to share their Aadhaar details, other regulated entities would have to rely on offline Aadhaar. This means that customers will have to either use Aadhaar XML files or Aadhaar Secure QR code for offline KYC.“While overall this is a major positive move, this is the only point where there could be some hindrances since consumers in rural and far flung geographies might still find it difficult to use these facilities for offline Aadhaar, but this will get smoothened soon,” said Wriju Ray, cofounder of Mumbai-based digital identification solutions startup IDfy.The guidelines have laid out the detailed process through which the video verification will be carried out by the regulated entities. This would include randomized set of questions to prevent spoofing, liveness checks on the applicant to ensure there is no scope for use of dummies. Also, the entire process needs to be encrypted to ensure protection from fraudulent attacks. In what could be an additional boost to the startup ecosystem, the regulator has also allowed application of artificial intelligence based software to ensure the integrity of the process.Further the regulator has allowed the business correspondents to facilitate the process, which means that companies need to provide agents with a smartphone or a tablet with an application through which the video verification can be carried out.The move is set to be a booster for the startup and fintech ecosystem which had suffered after the Supreme Court order that prevented private companies from accessing Aadhaar for any purposes. This had severely affected the onboarding process for such entities as they relied on digital systems to keep their cost of customer acquisition minimal."

content,"NoneNoneBut what was overlooked was that the situation has become extremely alarming. Taken against the backdrop of earlier disclosures by the government, it is clear that the amounts involved in frauds have been increasing year after year.  Public sector banks account for nearly 90 percent of the frauds in terms of the sum involved.Clearly, when instances of fraud keep increasing, and so do the amounts, some urgent steps need to be put into place. The Finance Minister’s statement was related to a six-month period.  Annualised, the figures would probably have been more than 10,000 cases, and more than Rs 1.8 lakh crore lost by way of fraud.Perhaps the first step required to remedy the situation is greater transparency.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is still shy of disclosing the names of the defaulters and officers involved.  In fact, tainted officers should be cauterized immediately, so that they are not allowed to carry on their creative bank book management elsewhere.But the government seems reluctant to part with information, the first pre-requisite for transparency.  Take two instances.NoneNoneNoneNoneThe current crisis in Indian banks warrants such moves urgently.  It won’t help if people put their money with Google or PayTM rather than banks.  Foregoing saving interest is better than losing one’s capital, isn’t it?Will bank reforms begin in full earnest?"

content,"After effecting a major VIP security cut and withdrawal of SPG cover from the Gandhis, the Union government has now decided to completely remove NSG commandos from this task, official sources said.This will be after over two decades that the 'black cat' commandos of the elite counter-terror force will be taken out from VIP protection duties, a task not originally charted for it when the force was conceptualised and raised in 1984.The force provides proximate and mobile security cover — commandos armed with sophisticated assault weapons — under the top 'Z+' category to 13 'high-risk' VIPs that entails about two dozen personnel for each one of them.NoneThe other NSG protectees include ex-CMs Mayawati, Mulayam Singh, Chandrababu Naidu, Parkash Singh Badal and Farooq Abdullah, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani.Official sources said the Union Home Ministry ""is of the view"" that the National Security Guard (NSG) should concentrate on its original charter of handling specific tasks of counter-terrorist and anti-hijack operations and that the task of securing high-risk VIPs was proving to be a ""burden"" on its limited and special capabilities.""The NSG needs to go back to its original mandate of counter-terror and anti-hijack duties. That is the reason behind the latest move,"" a senior official in the security establishment said.The removal of VIP security duties from the NSG will result in freeing about 450 commandos, who will be used to enhance the fighting components of the force that is spread across five hubs in the country and a main garrison in Gurugram near Delhi, officials said.As per a plan being worked out, the security of the VIPs under NSG cover could be handed over to paramilitary forces such as the CRPF and the CISF which already provide security to about 130 prominent persons jointly.The CRPF was recently handed over the security of five ex-SPG protectees — former PM Manmohan Singh and his wife, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her children Priyanka and Rahul — apart from securing Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.The Central Reserve Police Force is well suited for handling the new task, officials said.The Central Industrial Security Force protects VIPs like NSA Ajit Doval and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat among others, they added.The plan to relieve NSG from VIP security tasks has been in the making since 2012 when NSG commanders foresaw an event where simultaneous terror attacks could be witnessed at one time on multiple centres in the country and the commandos will have to be rushed in different directions.""The 26/11 Mumbai attack involved some 400 NSG commandos over three days. Considering we have multiple terror hits at one go, NSG needs to have a good number of fighting commandos and some in the strike reserves to replace them,"" a senior official had then said.After a major security review by the Modi 2.0 government in July last year, 1,300 commandos had been freed as the Centre removed or scaled down the security cover of as many as 350 politicians and former and present lawmakers."

content,"- NoneIts UK-based subsidiary has sealed an agreement with Dr Muller Pharma s.r.o. for a 100 percent stake sale in its Czech arm - Tata Global Beverages Czech Republic. Additionally, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved the scheme of arrangement between Tata Global Beverages and Tata Chemicals, which paves the way for demerger of the consumer product business from Tata Chemicals and integration of the same with TGBL.Stake sale in Czech subsidiaryTable: Tata Global Beverages Czech Republic (FY19)NoneSource: Tata Global BeveragesThe stake sale in the Czech subsidiary for Rs 31.7 crore (euro 4 million) includes compensation for trademark rights. At EV (enterprise value)/Sales level, this comes to a mere 0.7x, which is at a discount to TGBL's trading multiple of 3.1x.However, we don’t see this metric as a right one for comparison as the subsidiary has been reporting loss. In FY19, the bottom line loss for the subsidiary was to the tune Rs 4.7 crore on a sales of Rs 47.9 crore. In fact, EV/Net worth multiple of 3.9 appears to be reasonable compared with some of the notable names in the domestic beverage industry.Table: EV/Net worthNoneSource: Moneycontrol ResearchThe NCLT green lightWith the NCLT nod, we believe that the merger with the consumer-facing business of Tata Chemicals and its positioning in the FMCG space remain key catalyst for the long term.Addition of newer complementary categories such as macro snacks, beverages such as juices or other staple products cannot be ruled out, where Britannia, Dabur and ITC are major competitors, respectively. However, we see a substantial gestation period before it plays out to have a significant impact on the bottom line.OutlookAll said, the recent news flow only lends credence to the company’s continuous focus on restructuring and plan to exit un-remunerative businesses. Continuous monitoring of international portfolio makes sense as some of the markets are facing challenges, including category shrinkage due to heightened competition.  And in this context, the stake sale of Czech business is a welcome move.The recent operational performance stood out, too. Tata Global’s 8 percent volume growth in the India business in Q2 FY20 was commendable, given the prevailing consumption headwinds. The management noted that beverages has done better than other FMCG categories even though it also faced a slowdown in rural areas.Further, the company has been able to gain market share in the domestic market. The acquisition of Dhunseri Tea bolsters its leading position in the domestic tea market. The JVs, Tata Starbucks and NourishCo, are also progressing well, with the latter achieving break-even at the net profit level.Tata Global seems well placed to take on competition with increasing investments in brands, advertisement and promotional initiatives. However, this is likely to keep operating margin in check.NoneWe think that a large part of the near to medium term positives is already factored in and hence, we remain on the sidelines. Investors who had bought the stock to participate in a turnaround story and benefited from corporate restructuring can consider the recent rally as an opportunity to book profit.Follow @anubhavsaysNone"

title,Liquidity in trading Bharat Bond ETF units crucial for enhancing retail investor participation
datetime,2020-01-10 20:59:00+00:00
description,"Bharat Bond ETFs were listed on exchanges on January 2. The NSE data shows between January 2 to January 9, the Bond series 2023 has had daily trading volumes between 8,600 to 40,700 ETF units. For the same period, bond series 2030 has had trading volumes of 13,000 to 50,600 units approximately. "
content,"The Bharat Bond ETF, launched by the government through Edelweiss Mutual Fund, received a positive response as it was oversubscribed 1.7 times at its new fund offer that was launched on December 2019.This ETF, which has two series that mature in 2023 and 2020 respectively, is comprised of bonds of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), an avenue for the PSUs to raise interest bearing capital for the long term.An ETF is a mode of investment that comprises a basket of stocks or bonds that are traded, similar to individual stocks, on an exchange during regular trading hours.For long term investment strategists, Bharat Bond ETF's oversubscription by 70 percent has hinted at a strong secondary market appetite, and a demand to buy these bonds when listed. Globally, such bond ETFs are held till maturity by institutions like pension funds or retail investors. They typically subscribe to an exit option through stock exchange trading mechanism at the time of listing, which they can initiate if they don't wish to hold the bond ETF till maturity. On January 2, 2020, Bharat Bond 2023 was listed at Rs 1,001.85 and Bharat Bond 2030 was listed at Rs 1,004.90.It gives retail investors an alternative to bank Fixed Deposits (FDs) at comparable interest rate gains with added benefit of exiting before the bond matures through the buy/sell mechanism of stock exchanges. Thus, liquidity, which in this case is the availability of daily buy/sell quotes of Bharat Bond ETF on exchanges, assumes crucial importance for the next series of bond ETFs to see greater traction from retail investors. This two way buy/sell quote can be managed by an appointed agency by the mutual fund that is called the Authorised Participant.NoneThis buy/sell quote facility for Gold ETFs was initially left to the mutual funds to manage. UTI Gold ETF was among the first ones to be launched in 2007. Later the big names and new Asset Management Companies (AMCs) also launched their Gold ETFs.“When ETF fund appetite picked up by 2009-10, it was observed by SEBI that the volume of buy/sell quotes was not healthy for the ETFs listed on the exchanges,” said an ex SEBI DGM who worked in its mutual fund department on the launch of gold ETFs. “SEBI started prescribing minimum two authorized participants per ETF scheme that ensured continuous buy/sell quotes since 2010,” said the ex SEBI officer.  It has been observed that the presence of two Authorised Participants for buy/sell ETF quotes on exchanges has been a regular feature for ETFs launched from 2010 onwards. Successful subscription of Bharat Bond ETFsBharat Bond ETFs were listed on exchanges on January 2. The NSE data shows between January 2 to January 9, the Bond series 2023 has had daily trading volumes between 8,600 to 40,700 ETF units. For the same period, bond series 2030 has had trading volumes of 13,000 to 50,600 units approximately. This bond trading volume is much superior when compared with gold ETF trading volumes at  NSE. For example, during same period, UTI gold ETF daily volumes ranged between just 1,000 to 5,000 units, HDFC gold ETF daily volumes ranged between 2,800 to 11,000 units, and Axis Gold ETF ranged just 800 to 4,600 ETF units, to name a few. Industry experts said that Bharat Bond ETF's larger trading volumes is a signal to the government that investors have a strong investment appetite for the top rated PSUs when structured in a friendly manner."

description,"""Every government will like to bring down the cost of medication. Currently the US market is fed through intermediaries. So, understandably they (California) want to cut back on the intermediaries, which have a hefty margins upwards of 10-20 percent,"" said Dinesh Dua, Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil)."
content,"Indian generic drug companies may have to prepare for a major change in the US market as California is looking to to sell generic prescription drugs under its own brand.None""The state would contract with one or more generic drug manufacturers to manufacture certain generic drugs on behalf of the state and participating entities,"" Newsom added.Newsom, a member of Democratic Party, is also proposing another unconventional measure to establish a single market for drug pricing by bringing all purchasers such as the public and private medical coverage providers under one umbrella.“Drug manufacturers would have to bid to sell their drugs at a uniform price in the California market. California would invoke a most-favoured nation clause in the manufacturer price bid, which would require manufacturers to offer prices at or below the price offered to any other state, nation, or global purchaser if they wish to sell their products in California,” the budget proposal said.Newsom expects the proposal will increase competition in the generic market, resulting in lower generic prices for all purchasers. Newsom is making efforts to lower healthcare costs to the state's 40 million residents, of which around 33 percent are Medicaid enrollees. California spends about $100 billion on Medicaid.Last year, he brought in a law that barred branded drug makers from entering into ""pay-to-delay"" deals with generic drug makers, the first such one in the US.Drug prices have become a major issue in both California and else where in US, as six out of 10 Americans take a prescription and 79 percent say the cost is unreasonable, according to a survey by Kaiser Family Foundation.Mixed bagThe details of the proposals are yet to be made public. But if the proposals see the light of the day, California would become a tender-based market for generic drugs, where companies will have to compete to win supply contracts.NoneThe three distributors - AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson - and other intermediaries control the around 80 percent of US market.Dua said the impact on margins will not be huge, as American contract prices can't be compared with other countries.""The volumes will increase substantially because the per unit cost to the ultimate users and the state insurance companies and state funding agencies will be much lower,"" Dua added.Another executive of pharmaceutical company who didn't want to be named said they are still waiting for more details of the proposals."

description,"NITI Aayog has said that the proposed plan is to bring private capital to setup medical colleges and privatise operations, and management of the associated district hospital is to address shortage of qualified doctors"
content,"Government policy think tank NITI Aayog’s proposed draft scheme to link new or existing private medical colleges with district public hospital under public private partnership (PPP), to address the shortage of doctors is out.The think tank will be conducting a stakeholders' meet on January 21 for further consultations.""The said Concession Agreement has been developed based on the international best practices, and similar PPP arrangements that are operative in the States of Gujarat and Karnataka. Under this envisioned model, the Concessionaire shall design, build, finance, operate and maintain the medical college and also upgrade, operate and maintain the associated District Hospital with a minimum annual student intake of 150 MBBS seats,"" NITI Aayog said in the draft posted on its website.The Aayog has said that the proposed plan is to bring private capital to setup medical colleges and privatise operations, and management of the associated district hospital is to address shortage of qualified doctors.India has around 9.2 lakh doctors in active service, with one doctor for every 1,457 people as per the country's current population estimate of 1.35 billion. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends one doctors for every 1,000 people.""It is practically not possible for the Central or state the government to bridge the gaps in the medical education with their limited resources and finances. This necessitates formulating a PPP model by combining the strengths of public and private sectors. Accordingly, a scheme to link new and/or existing Private Medical Colleges with functional District Hospitals through PPP would augment medical seats and also rationalise the costs of medical education,"" NITI Aayog said.The scheme can be extended to 734 district hospitals across India.Scheme highlightsThe draft concessionaire agreement suggests that a private entity registered under the Companies Act, 2013, would get the contract and implements the scheme.The concession period is for 60 years. The proposed concessionaire agreement hands over land and all assets of the district hospital to the concessionaire for the period. There is a provision for an extension at the end of 60 years.The draft suggests that an existing district hospital selected for the PPP-treatment should have at least 750 beds or the number of beds prescribed by the Medical Council of India (MCI).Further, all in-patient beds are to be categorised into “regulated beds” and “market beds”. Out of 750 beds, at least 20 percent of the beds shall be for free patients and for which the treatment shall be provided free of cost. Currently, all beds in general wards of district hospitals are free. The remaining are highly subsidised.The private partner will have to pay the government a share of it gross revenue. The concessionaire has to pay from seven years after the Commercial Operations Date, a share in the Gross Revenue (Revenue Share) as 1 percent for the Gross Revenue in the relevant year. This will increase by 1 percent for every one-year period thereafter, during the concession period, subject to a limit of 20 percent of the gross revenue of such year.To be sure, this proposal is part of government’s gradual shift from healthcare provider to buyer of healthcare services -- especially tertiary care, where healthcare will be provided by the private sector. However, there are some exceptions like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and other public hospitals.Viability of PPPJan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a healthcare NGO, did a deep dive into the draft Concessionaire Agreement and found several inconsistencies. JSA suggests that the experiments with PPPs have failed in most instances.government may or may not be covering,” JSA said.“And this is after it has been charging Rs 3 lakh per medical student and Rs 8 lakhs for an NRI student. Moreover, for Adani, which has a Rs 24,000 crore investment in that district of Gujarat, this was well within its CSR obligations. Even when within Gujarat the scheme was sought to be expanded to six districts (Tapi, Dahod, Panchamahals, Banaskantha, Bharuch and Amreli) there have been no takers for this,"" JSA added.It also cites examples of world’s biggest experiment in health PPPs in England (Private Finance Initiative) is brought to an abrupt end by the government there due to mounting negative impacts on the public purse and wide scale failure to deliver value for money.""The cost of Sweden’s PPP hospital has doubled in cost to the government and is now known as the most expensive hospital in the world and the PPP hospital in Lesotho was estimated to have cost half the nation’s health budget in 2014 and in 2017, the cost doubled the affordability threshold agreed by the government and World Bank,"" JSA adds.Some concernsAlong with the viability of PPPs and converting public healthcare to profit private entities, there are concerns about what is going to happen to government's reservation policy in admissions and jobs, if these hospitals are privatised."

title,White Label ATMs are driving ATM penetration in India
datetime,2020-01-13 20:02:00+00:00
description,The primary objective of authorizing non-banks to operate WLAs is to enhance the spread of ATMs in semi-urban and rural areas.
content,"Rustom IraniFor India's population of over 1.3 billion, cash still remains the favoured and for many the only means of payment, particularly in semi-urban and rural areas. While debit card issuance increased rapidly in the last few years, the number of ATMs has not increased commensurately, creating a challenging situation for banks and inconveniencing customers. India trails behind other markets when it comes to ATM penetration. India has 18 ATMs per lakh of population, compared to China (63), Brazil (81), Japan (107) & Australia (132). In India, with ATM availability in tier 3, tier 4 locations even lower at approximately five ATMs for every lakh citizens, this problem is aggravated even further.With a view to increase financial inclusion and drive ATM penetration in the country, the RBI had endorsed the launch of White Label ATMs (WLAs) that allow private non-bank companies to institute and operate their own brand of ATMs in the country. Any non-bank entity with a minimum net worth of ₹ 100 crores can apply for WLA licence. The primary objective of authorizing non-banks to operate WLAs was to enhance the spread of ATMs in semi-urban and rural areas, specifically in Tier III to VI areas, where bank-owned ATM network was not growing.WLAs are linked to the National Financial Switch (NFS) of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) which means the consumers of any bank can use WLA services seamlessly. WLA Operators manage and operate the ATMs; take care of the infrastructure along with the cash requirement for the ATMs, thus enabling basic banking services. They get paid an interchange fee fixed by the RBI, which is paid by the bank of the consumer who uses their ATM service. They also need to follow stringent security norms specified by RBI as they are regulated by RBI.In effect there are three intrinsic parties who are part of WLA operations: Non-bank entities like Hitachi Payment Services; card networks like RuPay, Visa or Mastercard; and a sponsor bank for cash management and funds settlement. Sponsor banks provide cash and are accountable to settle transactions for these ATMs while the maintenance and servicing of the ATM site and necessary co-ordination with the sponsor bank is the WLA operator’s responsibility.On the consumer front, the WLAs are no different than using ATMs of any other bank. Consumers with debit card of any bank can withdraw cash from such ATMs as well as avail other services such as balance enquiry, pin change etc. Similar as other bank ATMs, number of transactions at WLAs are also free as per RBI guidelines.With the government’s financial inclusion program such as Jhan Dhan Yojana and other Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), more ATMs are required in rural locations. As consumers receive government subsidies as direct cash transfers in their bank accounts, ATMs are an important touch point that facilitates easy access to cash. In effect, White Label ATMs can provide the much-needed infrastructure thereby complementing various government initiatives.In spite of a variety of efforts, a large part of the rural population still remains underserved. This offers an exclusive prospect for WLAs to scale their operations over the next few years, potentially providing access to millions of more consumers and contributing to the financial inclusion agenda.To aid this, the RBI has taken various measures to propel the growth of WLAs and make them financially viable. It permitted WLAs to take cash from RBI designated currency chests or source cash from any scheduled bank / RRBs as well as allowed WLAs to exhibit advertisements at the ATM site. The RBI has also permitted deployment of cash recycling machines to enable interoperable cash deposit services and banks can issue co-branded ATM cards in association with the authorized WLAs.A growing economy and ever-increasing demand for financial services will put massive pressure on the banking system that will be quite untenable at the existing level of infrastructure. Here, the ecosystem needs to invest in further developing the infrastructure and educating consumers in smaller towns and cities to persuade across-the-board adoption of various payment channels."

The government is still working on modalities of revival plan including a proposal to write-off debt to the tune of Rs 300 crore, before IVC is handed over to any strategic partner.Still there is no clarity whether the government is looking for an outright sale of IVC or retain a significant minority interest in HLL Biotech Limited (HBL).""The Union Cabinet will have to approve the plan, following which the expression of interest has to be made. All this would take at least a year,"" a person privy to the information said.Though Bharat Biotech is the frontrunner, other companies are also expected to be in the fray.NoneNotwithstanding the messy state of affairs at IVC, the assured offtake of 75 percent of production by the government for its Universal Immunization Programme, is what draws Bharat Biotech towards it. In India government is the buyer of vaccines.NoneCreating a vaccine empireBharat Biotech was founded in 1994, by yeast molecular biologist Krishna Ella and his wife Suchitra Ella. The company came into the limelight when it launched Revac-B, a recombinant Hepatitis-B vaccine, in October 1998. Priced at $1, it was the cheapest Hepatitis-B vaccine in the world at that time. The company later launched oral polio vaccine (OPV).The two vaccines, prequalified by World Health Organisation (WHO) helped the company survive and reinvest in research and development for developing new vaccines. Ellas also took loans, grants and sold shares to pump more than Rs 1000 crore into research.The result of those efforts were launch of Rotavirus Vaccine (RV) against childhood diarrhoea, Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV), Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine, Influenza vaccine and a five-in-one Pentavalent vaccine. The company is also developing inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), as the OPV will be phased out globally by 2023.Currently along with OPV, Bharat Biotech’s Rotavirus and Typhoid vaccines are WHO prequalified, making it eligible for supplies to UN agencies and participate in public tenders in developing world.Bharat Biotech, like other Indian vaccine companies, relies on government for its supplies. Bharat Biotech gets almost half of its sales from Indian government. Given the pricing pressure and delayed payments, the company is also looking at the private market. The company had tied-up with Abbott India to market four of its vaccines under the latter's label.And, the efforts are bearing fruit.Bharat Biotech ended FY19 with revenues of Rs 774.3 crore, with a profit after tax of Rs 133.3 crore. The operating profit margin stood at 28.7 percent, with negligible debt.Interestingly for Bharat Biotech, its newer generation vaccines have started to gain traction.The TCV contributed to 57 percent of the company's revenues during FY19, as against 27 percent FY18. However it is the Rotavirus Vaccine, that’s holding the key for its future growth with supply contracts from both the Indian government as well as UNICEF.With healthy cash flows, Bharat Biotech is now focusing on inorganic expansion.The company acquired Chiron from GlaxoSmithKline Asia in February 2019. Chiron is a WHO pre-qualified manufacturer of rabies vaccines with a manufacturing plant in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, eligible for supplies to UN agencies and has product registrations in more than 20 countries.Bharat Biotech paid Rs 68 crore for the acquisition. The company has infused around Rs 60 crore into Chiron during FY2020 to revive production, and it plans an additional Rs.60 crore investment to enhance the Chiron’s facility in FY21. The entire investment will be made through internal accruals.""Bharat Biotech performance to remain strong over the next two fiscals, supported by wider usage of RV across the country and ramp up in supplies to UNICEF, in addition to commencement of TCV supplies to the UNICEF. Order visibility for OPV under longterm supply arrangement (LTA) with UNICEF till its cessation (expected in FY2023) is also expected to support revenues,"" said rating agency ICRA in its report in August.Bharat Biotech is occasionally in news for an IPO or raising private equity to give exit to ICICI Venture, International Finance Corp, the investment arm of the World Bank, and Subhkam Ventures have invested in Bharat Biotech a decade back."

Subsequently, targets are given to these entities to improve their financial health on critical parameters in a time-bound manner, mainly on capital adequacy and bad assets resolution.Currently, there are six banks under PCA. These are the Central Bank of India, UCO Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, United Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank. Of these, Lakshmi Vilas is the only private bank, while IDBI is owned by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).A senior banking industry official, who requested anonymity, told this writer that RBI has no such plan to ‘auction’ private banks. ""An authorised entity, under certain circumstances, can auction the assets of a distressed company. But, how a company/bank itself can be auctioned? These are also governed by concerned Acts,"" the official said.Clampdown on co-operative banksThe RBI got a shocker last year when a major scam broke out at Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC), one of the biggest banks in the country’s co-operative sector.The bank hid details of its loans from the RBI for a long time. Out of its total loan book of Rs 8,383 crore, as on 31 March 2019, about 70 percent was given to one real estate firm, HDIL.The crisis is yet to be resolved. The RBI superseded the board of PMC bank in September and the process to recover money from HDIL is still an ongoing affair.PMC was not the first co-operative bank that failed and there have been several cases in the past. But, the regulator let the sector thrive with light regulations.Early this week, the RBI overhauled the rules for co-operative banks introducing a revised Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) under which an urban co-operative bank (UCB) will come under SAF if the net non-performing assets (NPAs) cross 6 percent of the total loans.SAF is the equivalent of PCA for commercial banks. Depending on the financial health of the bank, RBI can impose further restrictions on lending and deposit-taking operations of the concerned bank.The SAF comes into effect even if the bank incurs losses for a long period.Forced mergers on the cards?While ‘auctioning’ a distressed bank is a bit of a stretch, RBI could very well consider playing the role of a matchmaker to merge weak banks with stronger ones.There are several instances when RBI has done ‘forced mergers’ on account of weak financial health or financial irregularities in target entities. The idea is to protect depositors’ money in the event of the bank's total collapse.In 2004, the erstwhile Global Trust Bank was merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC). In 2006, erstwhile United Western Bank merged with IDBI and in 2010, Bank of Rajasthan merged with ICICI Bank.The poor financial health of these targeted entities was rumoured as the reason. While these are some of the large cases of mergers on account of financial distress, a number of mergers have happened among smaller banks where promoters found synergy, with no force by the regulator.In the cases of commercial banks under PCA and large UCBs under SAF too, there is a possibility that the regulator will look at merger options, according to senior bankers."

content,"In a meeting held recently, group leaders of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have unanimously decided to sanction funds for 23 new luxury cars for its senior members.As per the proposal that is awaiting a nod from the Standing Committee of the civic body, the new cars will be given to BMC’s committee chairmen and leaders of Opposition.All leaders and chairmen of committees of the civic body are assigned a chauffeur-driven car. The tabled proposal mentions that the cars being used by corporators at the moment are more than 10 years old and have exhausted their kilometre limits. As a result, there are machinery breakdowns every other day.NoneSpeaking about the development, Ravi Raja, the Leader of Opposition in the civic body, said: “I have been stuck in traffic due to a car break down at least three to four times. I have even got late for BMC meetings because of this and forced to take taxis to reach office. The cars are old and do not work properly.”The LoP further said: “The old cars will be scrapped. If they are still usable, they will be transferred to other departments.”Once the standing committee’s approval is in, 23 Toyota Innovas will reportedly be purchased. Prior to this, the civic body leaders were using Mahindra Scorpios.Interestingly, while the top leaders of BMC are batting for new cars, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar denounced the official vehicle assigned to her by the corporation. Refusing to accept a second car (for her family), she made headlines by asking the civic body to donate the amount to the Mayor’s fund instead."

content,"Shabbir KayyumiMarket witnessed high volatility last week though it hit a new high on January 10. Although the index has formed a bullish body candlestick pattern with big lower shadow on the weekly timeframe, selling pressure near the previous high (12,300) cannot be ruled out.The rising histogram on MACD indicator and signal line trading above 0-line with bullish crossover is also supportive of the current bullish structure on the index. Nifty is continuously trading higher above all popular moving averages (20/50/100/200) DMA indicating strong bullish bias to continue further. At the same time 5 week DMA is standing near 12,190 levels and a decisive close below it will be an early sign of trend reversal.On the other hand, once Nifty surpasses 12,300 resistance zones, it can march towards 12,500 and subsequently towards 12,600 levels which are near the rising trend line and upper band of Bollinger Band.A lot of activity in FNO segment is seen, whereas the highest Open Interest (OI) in PUT is around 12,000 strikes and maximum Open Interest (OI) in CALL is around 12,500 levels suggesting trading range for the month is 11,800 and 12,500 marks.Bank Nifty gave a sharp correction in the last week; buy managed to gave bounce back in the second half of the week.

description,"His audacious bid of Rs 2,775 crore in the March afternoon in 2006 will go down in history as the reason behind the stupendous rise in value of BCCI's broadcast rights."
content,"It won't be an exaggeration to call Harish Thawani a 'maverick'. Having managed to outbid heavyweights like ESPN-Star, Sony and Zee in the fierce battle for rights to telecast matches of the Indian cricket team on home soil more than a decade ago, gut-feeling surely must have prevailed over business sense.His audacious bid of Rs 2,775 crore in the March afternoon in 2006 will go down in history as the reason behind the stupendous rise in value of BCCI's broadcast rights.From then on, aggressive bids by broadcasters have ensured that the BCCI always gets to hawk maximum moolah.In 2020, Thawani is not remotely associated with sports broadcasting. The former Chairman/CEO of Neo Sports and at present, founder of The Indus Club, an exclusive club for the rich and famous, has in the past decade seen established entities like Star and Sony dominate a genre in which he used to call the shots.His firm Nimbus Communications, once primed for an IPO, went bust due to factors ranging from impact of recession to souring of ties with BCCI mandarins.Now watching from the sidelines, Thawani does not believe that digital platforms will trample the traditional TV viewing mode.NoneNoneNeo's fall coincided with Star upping its game. Starting with the acquisition of BCCI rights in 2012 and then buying out Walt Disney's stake in the erstwhile ESPN-Star JV, the Uday Shankar-led Star India strutted its financial might to help kickstart a sporting revolution in the country.When asked about Star's deep-pocketed investments and their approach, Thawani points that he would have had taken a different approach.""Uday has actually done an incredible job of furthering their sports business. The only two missteps they may have taken (and who doesn’t) was overpay for niche sports like badminton and let go of their first option for renewal of Australian and English cricket rights, which allowed Sony to get back in the game,"" he said.Apart from cricket, Thawani also tried to inject glamour into hockey by launching World Series Hockey with much fanfare in 2012. But it failed to make an impact and died a quick death due to factionalism in the game's governing body.According to Thawani, poor governance, inadequate infrastructure and a disproportionate sense of own importance on the part of sports federations are the reasons behind the lack of proper utilisation of commercial avenues by non-cricket bodies.So, what does he think about the 'Khelo India' movement?Thawani feels the government must walk the talk in this context.""Slogans don't make a sporting nation. Participation does and that requires vision, investments in infrastructure and dedicated execution,"" he said.Industry observers were once in awe of Neo's rise to the top. The slide was equally dramatic.Where did he go wrong?""Having achieved the No.1 sports network slot by all-India full year ratings within two years of launch, we should have pressed ahead with more investments instead of consolidating. Also, we could have managed the politics of sports better,"" Thawani rued.His current venture, The Indus Club, located at One BKC in Mumbai, is keeping him busy nowadays and he is making expansion plans.""The Indus Club is at the confluence of business leadership, sports, entertainment and culture. I am focussing on expanding the brand to Bengaluru and NCR this year,"" he said.So, does he still harbour ambitions of returning to his old stomping ground?""Don’t have immediate plans but anything can happen. Many sportsmen come back after retirement! Never say never,"" he signed off."

content,"Shabbir KayyumiThe Cup & Handle (C&H) pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable and popular patterns among traders. In technical analysis, a C&H pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. A C&H reversal pattern forms after a downtrend and its completion marks a trend reversal to an uptrend.In the standard C&H pattern, we connect the high after Cup with the high created after the handle. A trend line is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called as “Neckline"". This trend line is the most important component of the pattern.Why Buy Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M)?NoneNoneBuy Signal:4. Decent volume participation while pattern breakout is also giving additional confirmation.Profit Booking:Target as per C&H pattern is calculated by adding the height of Cup to the neckline which comes to Rs 575, however one can book profits near previous swing high which is around Rs 570.Stop Loss:Entire bullish view negates on breaching of Handle on a closing basis and one should exit from a long position.

description,Enjoy your financial freedom. Do Spend. But save something for the rainy day as well
content,"NoneHer current discretionary and lifestyle expenses are Rs 10,000-15,000 a month, and her parents gave her this amount through her period of study.But now, Karishma feels anxious as she is all set to join her first job soon and would be forced to take financial responsibility, independently. There would be no monthly allowance from her parents and she needs to manage her monthly expenses, start repaying equated monthly instalments (EMIs) for her education loan of Rs 4 lakh and save for her post-graduation program’s fees.This scenario is common among several millennials in India when they join their first jobs. Says Karishma, “To manage my finances in a better way, I have started seeking knowledge by reading newspapers, periodicals, personal finance blogs, watching news, etc. regularly for the last one year.” She is learning budgeting skills from her parents and is attending financial planning workshops on holidays/weekends to understand the various assets to invest in, the importance of insurance, tax-planning, etc.Shyam Sunder, Managing Director of PeakAlpha Investment Services Pvt Limited points out, “It’s been observed that, in the early 20s, investors can plan their finances better with the right knowledge and financial skills as they don’t have a spouse or a child to look after. They should invest at least 50-60 per cent of their monthly income after starting on a job.” The balance amount can be utilised for monthly expenses, EMIs, credit card dues, etc.Here are some financial planning tips for you to get started.Contingency fund and investment planningPrashant Gaitonde (25) resides in Bengaluru and works as a software developer. While starting off in July 2017, he was in a dilemma on where to invest, time-frame etc. He didn’t know much about building a contingency fund, which is the first step towards saving and investing. During the initial months after he started working, he used his savings for discretionary expenses. In other words, he spent on items that weren’t very essential. Since he lacked the knowledge of other financial assets, he followed his parents’ advice of investing only in fixed deposits. He managed to save around Rs 4 lakh in the initial 15 months of working and this was invested only in bank fixed deposits.In November 2018, he attended a financial planning workshop organised by his organisation. He learnt that contingency fund is an amount of money set aside specifically for emergencies – temporary job loss, any uninsured medical conditions, etc. As a software developer, Prashant is quite familiar with frequent job losses that have plagued the sector for years. So, as a thumb rule, he has now kept aside three months’ worth of basic living-expenses from the Rs 4 lakh parked in fixed deposits. He has built a contingency fund by investing in liquid and ultra-short term mutual fund schemes.Saurav Basu, Head of Wealth Management, Tata Capital Financial Services says, “Millennials should use the thumb rule – 50:20:30 – wherein 50 per cent of the income should go towards living expenses and spending (including food, travel, etc.); 20 per cent towards savings for your short-term goals or for liquidity purpose; and 30 per cent towards long-term goals (like planning for children education, marriage, retirement; basically wealth creation).”Upon engaging a financial planner, Prashant realised the importance of diversification and equities in achieving his long-term goals. He moved excess amounts from fixed deposits to invest in large-cap funds. Then, after understanding how mutual fund schemes work, he started monthly investments in mid and multi-cap schemes. Sunder advices, “Millennial investors should commence investing in large-cap or index funds and then diversify to multi-cap or mid-cap funds as per their risk appetite.”Often, millennials feel that retirement is too far away and avoid investing for this goal. However, since age is on their side, the amount they would need to save each month for retirement would be relatively quite low.Don’t depend on employer’s insuranceCompanies these days tend to provide insurance cover to employees. Policies include those relating to health, personal accident and life insurance benefits. However, the insurance cover varies for employees based on their rank/grade in the company. Also, for several employees, the insurance cover offered by the company may be inadequate.For instance, Prashant’s employer had offered him a health insurance cover of Rs 4 lakh. Considering, today’s medical inflation, this amount is low for him or his parents. So, after taking some advice from his financial advisor, he purchased a family floater policy of Rs 10 lakh.Radhika Shah, CEO and Director of Aarvi insurance brokers says, “Millennials switch jobs multiple times in their 20s and 30s, and so depending on insurance policies of employers is not the best option.” Basically, when you leave the current organisation, the insurance benefits are not transferred to the new employer.Also, the new employer may not offer insurance benefits, and so you may have to purchase an insurance policy outside. If your health condition worsens, then insurance company may charge a higher premium when you buy a policy privately. Shah advices, “Purchase health insurance policies when you are young and less likely to have a medical history with serious health conditions. Also, the cost of premium will be lower when you are young.”Repay education loans An educational loan is a hefty burden for most millennials. Repaying an educational loan takes away most of the savings. You must consider cutting down your expenses, and the saving could be invested.Also, you need to consider whether to repay the education loan early or to continue for the full tenure. Under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act, the entire interest you pay on education loan qualifies for deduction. This income tax deduction can be claimed for up to eight years.But it’s always advisable to repay the loan at the earliest. Besides, as Sunder adds, “Suppose, your annual income is low (i.e., in the tax exempted bracket), you will have to bear the full burden of the education loan. You won’t get any tax benefits.” For such people, it’s better to repay the education loan at the earliest.Avoid splurging and going overboard on loans According to a study by MoneyTap, an app-based credit line, the top three reasons for which millennials borrowed in 2019 were to pay bills (25.09 per cent), meet medical expenses (21.25 per cent) and spend on weddings (14 per cent).   For millennials, using credit cards can be risky, as they cannot refrain themselves from splurging their salaries. The easy availability of credit, along with exciting reward points, cashback offers and discounts is enticing for millennials.Thus many end up spending a lot more than what they could repay. To avoid such a situation, Prashant didn’t apply for any credit card in the initial 15 months after he started working. Sahil Arora, Director and Group Business Head of Investments and Insurance at Paisabazaar.com says, “The best to way to avoid overspending is to keep track of unbilled balances on your credit card and spend only what can be repaid by the bill’s due date.”Also, payday loans are becoming popular among millennials. These are ultra-short term, unsecured and high-interest personal loans of small ticket sizes that fill the temporary gap in cash flows. The loan amount ranges between Rs 500 and a few lakh rupees. The interest rate is one per cent per day which translates to 365 per cent annually. Many millennials are using them for regular purchases and discretionary spends. Dev Ashish, founder of StableInvestor.com says, “If millennial borrowers aren’t careful, this line of high-cost credit can easily push them into a debt trap. Such loans should be avoided for discretionary spends.”Final-year college graduates are now a few months way from stepping into the job market. At the other end, millennials, especially those who are in the first few years of employment, are most likely taking their life’s first steps into the world of money management."

description,"Currently, ZEE commands 25 percent of viewership in the Bhojpuri TV space. "
content,"NoneBut is Bhojpuri a strong market for the TV space?Amarpreet Saini, Business Head, ZEE Biskope and BIG Ganga, ZEEL, said, “The Bhojpuri market has seen significant growth. In comparison to other regional market, it is relatively new and it has also been inhabited by fewer channels. It (Bhojpuri) has taken its time to grow, but in the last two to three years, it has seen 80-85 percent growth in viewership which shows the hunger for authentic Bhojpuri content, and also gives an indication that there is far more room to grow.”Along with viewership, advertisers are also showing interest in the Bhojpuri space.“In the last three years if content consumption has seen 85 percent growth, then adex (advertising expenditure) growth has been almost 30-33 percent during the same period in the Bhojpuri market. If more vernacular content is in place then the advertisers’ interest for the market grows manifold,” said Samrat Ghosh, Cluster Business Head, East, ZEEL.How is Zee Placed in this market?Currently, ZEE commands 25 percent of viewership, said Saini.“Bihar and Jharkhand are primarily Hindi speaking markets. Hindi viewership combined with GEC (General Entertainment Channel), movies and some music channels, is 70-80 percent, and Bhojpuri will be 15-20 percent of the overall viewership pie. But in the last three years, especially in the last year, we have seen significant growth in Bhojpuri viewership and a decline in Hindi viewership,” he added.While a movie channel by ZEE in Bhojpuri is new, the network already had in place a GEC called BIG Ganga. Now, a lot of BIG Ganga’s content will be used for Zee Biskope.ZEE is banking on its library which includes over 300 movies and a blockbuster of the last five years and content featuring the top three superstars of the Bhojpuri cinema -- Nirahua, Pawan Singh and Khesari Lal Yadav.But ZEE is not alone in the Bhojpuri movie space and faces competition from channels like Bhojpuri Cinema TV, B4U Bhojpuri. Saini however, is confident of ZEE’s new addition."

content,"The maintenance work of Mumbai international airport's main runway is up to 60 percent over, and is likely to reopen on March 28, ahead of its schedule.More than 800 people with over 100 equipment are working for over six hours a day to re-carpet what is one of the busiest runways in the world.""Runway 9/27, which handles about 950 flights a day, was last upgraded in 2010-2011. Repair was needed to ensure safety of flights landing and taking off,"" said an executive from the industry.The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is operated by GVK Mumbai International Airport Ltd.  About 25 flights a day have been cancelled to enable the work.The repair work was postponed due to the prolonged monsoon. Since November 4, the runway has been closed for eight hours everyday, except Sunday and a few public holidays. It will be open for flight operations on January 15, February 19 and 21, March 10 and 25 on account of public holidays.The primary runway will now reopen on March 28, when the airlines complete their winter schedule, and just ahead of the busy summer season.Even as the repair work on the main runway goes on, the secondary runway - 14/32 - is available for take-offs and landings.Clockwork precisionThe main runway handles 97 percent of the Mumbai airport's traffic and thus the team repairing it needs to work in clockwork precision to hand it back for flight operations at 5.30 pm, everyday.The precision especially becomes a critical point when a new layer is laid. The mix, which is prepared in a plant erected at the airport, has to be laid at temperature of over 165 degrees.""This has to be done before 1.30 pm, so that there is enough time for rolling and then for cooling down before the runway can be used, post 5.30 pm,"" said the executive quoted above.Every day, about 100m of the runway is repaired, and about 700 tons of material is used to re-lay the surface.Apart from the runway, the operator also completes a lot of other associated work to make the most of the closure.""This includes upgrading systems used to guide airplanes to land, and the area around the runway that prevents a plane from overshooting,"" said the executive.The present work is the second phase of Major Rehabilitation project to keep the runways in good health.

title,How annuity payouts work
datetime,2020-01-09 08:35:00+00:00
description,Annuity income is taxable and returns tend to be lacklustre
content,"NoneFor retirees, identifying an instrument that safeguards their nest egg and provides a regular income during their retirement years is a critical task. While several such avenues – the senior citizens saving scheme (SCSS), Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) and post office monthly income scheme (POMIS) – are available, none of these guarantee income for life. And, this is precisely the gap that immediate annuities seek to fill.Who can invest in annuities?Anyone with a retirement corpus can sign up for immediate annuities. For National Pension System (NPS) subscribers, it is mandatory that they use 40 per cent of the corpus at maturity to buy annuities. However, the instrument comes with its share of limitations – annuity income is taxable and returns tend to be lacklustre. They range from 5.6-7 per cent per cent, depending on the annuity provider, the investor’s age at entry and the option chosen, among other factors.The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is the most dominant player in the space, controlling over 90 per cent market share. Its investment assets in the pension, general annuity and group fund segment were valued at Rs 7.79 lakh crore as of September 2019.NPS and regular incomeThe instrument was in the news once again recently, with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) announcing that it is considering offering an alternative – systematic withdrawal plans – to annuities. At present, NPS subscribers can, once they turn 60, withdraw 60 per cent of their corpus without paying tax. However, the balance 40 per cent has to mandatorily be used to buy annuities.All life insurers offer annuity schemes, but in case of NPS, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has empanelled seven annuity service providers. These include LIC, SBI Life, HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential Life, Kotak Life, Star Union Dai-ichi Life and IndiaFirst Life.Deferred vs immediate optionWhen you pay a lumpsum to buy an immediate annuity, the insurer promises to pay you a regular income.In the case of a deferred pension product, when the accumulation phase – investments are made regularly – is over, the corpus is used to buy an annuity. The quantum income depends on the age of the annuitant (the person buying annuity product), frequency of payment of regular income (annuity) and the option chosen.Know your optionsThe frequency of payment is a function of one’s need and the option chosen becomes the deciding factor. Here are the options that are typically on offer.Annuity for life: Here the life insurer pays the annuity till the policyholder is alive. After the death of the policyholder, the annuity stops and the purchase price paid to the insurer is retained by the insurance company.Among all options available, this choice fetches the highest amount of regular income. This option works for those who do not have any dependents financially, or do not have any family members or who do not want to anyone else to enjoy the wealth after their death.Annuity with guaranteed period and life thereafter: A person  may ask for guaranteed payouts for a stipulated period – say, 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. Even if the annuitant survives beyond the period for which the payouts were guaranteed, she continues to get paid by the insurer till her death. The purchase price stays with the insurer after the death of the annuitant or the guaranteed payout period, whichever is later.In case of the death of the annuitant during the period of the guaranteed payout, the insurer directs the benefits to the nominee appointed by the annuitant or to his/her legal heirs. For a longer period of guaranteed income, the quantum of annuity decreases. For example, the amount of annuity payable for a guaranteed period of five years and life thereafter will be more than that for the guaranteed period of ten years and life thereafter.Immediate annuity for life with return of purchase price: This option works for those wishing to retain the purchase price. The annuitant enjoys the payout, and after her death, the purchase price is paid to her nominee.Immediate annuity for life increasing at a simple rate: Inflation is the biggest enemy of most investors. In the long run, it can eat into one’s fortune. The income may appear good today, but over a period of time, it may not be sufficient. In all options mentioned above, the annuity, once fixed, does not change. To overcome such a scenario, this option can be taken. So, the annuity amount increases each year at a stipulated rate of, say, three per cent. The amount of annuity for the first year is clearly mentioned and so is the rate of increase. The rate of increase is computed using a simple rate of interest. Joint life annuity: This options work for those wanting to provide for their spouses. There are options to provide the same amount of annuity to the spouse or half the amount in case of the death of the primary annuitant. One can also choose 100 per cent annuity with the last survivor option under the joint life annuity and ask for return of purchase price. "

title,Scrapping of MDR to see fewer RuPay cards: Bankers
datetime,2020-01-06 18:59:00+00:00
description,"With banks forced to bear processing charges on RuPay cards, they were more likely to issue Mastercard and Visa cards"
content,"The government's decision to scrap the processing charges on RuPay debit cards could see fewer cards being issued since it puts the card scheme at a disadvantage against other two global players operating in India, Visa and Mastercard, two bankers have said.While government-owned banks could still be forced to issue RuPay cards, private banks could move out of the scheme and issue more of Mastercard and Visa cards, the bankers, who didn't wish to be identified, said.The move to do away with the merchant discount rate (MDR) could also hamper the growing adoption of RuPay cards for merchant payments, they warned.""We will have to bear the cost of processing these card swipes, while there will be no money to be made per transaction, banks will have to rethink their strategy on giving out RuPay cards,"" said a senior banker with a private sector lender on condition of anonymity.Along with Rupay cards, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions, too, has been made free from January 1.India has three major card schemes - National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)-run RuPay, Visa and Mastercard. There are over 843 million debit cards in the market.The latest numbers shared by the Payments Council of India (PCI), the industry body for payment companies, show there are around 500 million RuPay debit cards in circulation. A large number of these are Jan Dhan cards.""Banks have been issuing these cards because of the preferable pricing, but now with no money to be made per transaction, they could move back to issuing other card schemes where at least the MDR is applicable,"" said another banker in the know of the matter.""Also, there is doubt whether NPCI will reduce its charges on settling the transactions.""At the time of publication, NPCI had not responded to Moneycontrol's request for comments.Sources said zero-MDR order will hurt banks, as they stood to lose Rs 2,000 crore in revenue per year. MDR is the fee that the banks get from merchants for processing these transactions.It will be a double-hit for the banks - one the government will no longer reimburse MDR for a debit-card transaction of less than Rs 2,000 and second there is no MDR on Rupay debit cards.""For all RuPay debit card transactions, the MDR amount for last year was more than Rs 1,000 crore and was expected to grow to Rs 1,300 crore in this year,"" said a top banker. ""Including UPI, the amount would easily cross Rs 2,000 crore.""According to the Reserve Bank of India numbers, the share of RuPay cards in transactions has been growing steadily. From around 11.7% in the financial year 2016-17, the share of RuPay cards for merchant payments both offline and online has grown close to 30%.Till October 2019, around 3 billion debit card swipes were reported, of which around 700 million were RuPay card swipes. This number was only 282 million in 2016-17."

title,Review: LetsTrack Premium does a good job of tracking your car but it could do more
datetime,2020-01-08 17:55:00+00:00
description,LetsTrack Premium's price point is something that would offer value-for-money only for fleet users.
content,"LetsTrack, which calls itself Asia’s largest GPS-tracking service, has a slew of devices for vehicles, one of which we tried recently: LetsTrack Premium.The device, which costs Rs 8,999 (comes with a free one-year subscription, followed a yearly subscription plan of Rs 1,200) is a handy product that ably does its core job – tracking – besides offering a host of other features.The device is installed in a car by hooking it up with the electrical systems board. The system does not require any tinkering with the car’s own wiring system but can take an hour or so to be installed.LetsTrack employs a combination of GPS + GPRS technology (the device has a bundled Airtel SIM) to track when a car is on the move. This means that it is able to monitor movements on most occasions except when, say, a car is located in a basement.Users can track their vehicles through the app as well as a web login.Besides real-time tracking, users can set up notifications for a host of events: such as when a car’s engine has been started or stopped, when it moves out of a pre-defined parking zone or when it over-speeds.Alerts such as when the AC has been switched on or when a car is being driven erratically can also be set up, features that will come in handy if a car is chauffeured, or if it is used as part of a fleet service.Crucially, the device also allows users to cut off the car engine remotely, a nifty anti-theft feature.Having said that, two key features – the ability to track whether the car’s AC is switched on and to cut off the engine -- were not available in our Tata Nexon during the time of installation, something to do with compatibility.While using the app and web login, we got the constant feeling that it has been designed primarily for a fleet user, which would well be the company’s primary customer base.For instance, on the web dashboard, some of the sections that form part of the menu are ‘attendance report’ and ‘people tracking me’.This means that valuable real estate in the user interface (UI) has been devoted to features that may not come in handy for an individual user. This could have been handled by creating different UI profiles for an individual user and a fleet operator.Speaking of UI, the app has undergone a design change recently. While it has helped declutter the overall look, the change also seems to have robbed the app of some useful features, such as navigating to your vehicle through Google Maps.NoneSince the device has the ability to remotely cut off the vehicle, the company could have also provided the user the ability to remotely unlock the car's door (in case it gets accidentally locked with the key inside) or switch it on (how about switching on the car parked under the hot sun and turning on the AC a few minutes before you reach it?).A few other features, such as tracking fuel efficiency, does not work accurately.The device also lacks support from Google Assistant and Alexa, something that a few devices from the competition offer."

description,The brokers’ associations have been given a week’s time to submit the note on funding the margins of their clients.
content,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has told stockbrokers associations it is willing to allow brokers to fund their clients on margins for intra-day trades in cash and derivatives segments. The regulator has asked the associations to prepare a note on the matter.SEBI and brokers associations including the Bombay Stock Exchange broker forum, ANMI and CPAI had a four-hour-long meeting on January 8. SEBI whole-time member Madhabi Puri Buch and clearing corporation officials of  Bombay Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange, Multi Commodity Exchange officials also attended meetings.The meeting was about the new margin rules that were to be effective from January 1, 2020. Under the new rules, brokers will have to collect the margins upfront from their clients even for intra-day trades.The brokers’ associations have been given a week’s time to submit the note on funding the margins of their clients.A source present at the meeting told Moneycontrol: ""Brokers are saying that insisting on upfront margins will hurt liquidity. SEBI is not convinced about the liquidity angle but has said that it is fine as long as the brokers fund their clients' margin requirements with their (brokers’) own funds. But brokers have to give proof that the funds extended to their clients is the brokers’ funds, and that clients need to make it clear that those are intra-day trades.”In its November circular, SEBI said it was aligning margin processes for the derivative and cash market segments.The SEBI decision to bring margin rules for cash and derivatives segments on par follows instances of many brokers using the collateral of one client to pay for the margin of another.Another source who attended the meeting told Moneycontrol: ""Brokers association will send a note on using brokers' own money for funding client and new categories for intra-day products.""Stockbrokers had been pushing for a change in the rules that will allow them to collect margins from their clients after market closing, instead of collecting them upfront at the time of doing the trade, as SEBI rules currently require.SEBI has given brokers time until February 15 for weekly reporting of margin collections, which was to start from January 1."

title,BS-VI norms on real driving emissions will bring India up-to-par globally
datetime,2020-01-08 12:30:00+00:00
description,Car manufacturers will be made to randomly pick three customer vehicles every year to test them for emissions  
content,"The Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) roll-out in April will not just result in cleaner air but also enable carmakers to record real driving emissions (RDE), thus allowing for more stringent violation norms which will bring India at par with the developed markets.Car manufacturers will be made to randomly pick three customer vehicles every year and test them for emissions. The exercise will be conducted in cooperation with government-backed vehicle test agencies that also issue certification for a vehicle’s street-worthiness.NoneA top Maruti Suzuki executive said, ""BS-VI is not just about emission it is also about in-service conformity. This is a new norm for BS-VI where vehicles which are run for more than six months or 15,000 km or maximum 100,000 km for five years, the testing agency will ask the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to pick out three such customer vehicles every year and test it again on the chassis and prove that the emissions are not violating the norms.""While the government is believed to have contemplated enforcing the RDE norms much before April 1, the auto industry requested the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to implement the norms only after BS-VI fuel is available throughout India.""This is very much part of the BS-VI notification. Everybody thinks that BS-VI is about tailpipe emission but it is also about RDE to capture data. The test agency record RDE which is called as the data acquisition phase. Once that happens after one year they will come out with a conformity factor and the RDE regulation will come into 2023,"" the Maruti Suzuki executive added.RDE is the most preferred emission regulation method since it is aimed at reducing the gap between type-approval emission that occur during the certification (homologation) testing phase and those in the real world.Vehicular emission methods took big goodwill knock when German auto giant Volkswagen was accused of fudging data for years in the US. Since then several countries have put stricter norms to check on any intentional and unintentional violations.A top executive from Hyundai India said, ""This is the next generation regulations which will truly bring India to the global level as far vehicle emissions are concerned."""

title,A game developers console for creators of modern-day games to get better returns
datetime,2020-01-07 21:49:00+00:00
description,"In 2018, there were five billion unique games launched, of which, 50 percent were generated from India."
content,"Indians are not only playing more games, but also significantly increasing their contributions in making games.This is probably why WinZO Games recently announced launch of WinZO developers’ console, a platform for developers to connect and publish their games on the app.Talking to Moneycontrol, Saumya Singh, co-founder, WinZo Games, said that Indians are spending a considerable amount of time playing games. On the WinZO app, Indians spend 40 - 45 minutes in a day. Saumya believes that if this consumption is monetized well, the gaming industry has a lot of potential to grow even further.Game developers are not able to market and monetize their games, she added.Coming on WinZO app will expose the game developers to the platform’s over 15 million user-base, courtesy the newly-launched developer's console.Game developers through the console will be able to track data such as revenue generated, game sessions, unique users, user feedback of published games.They can even register and create their profile and get a unique ID to submit their game for approval.Once the game is uploaded, developers will be able to monitor the revenue the game earns through a multipurpose dashboard.While India has matured as a market for games, those who have the skill and talent to develop modern-day games are not getting good returns.In-app purchase and ad revenues for gaming content have been abysmally low in India. This is restricting developers’ focus on making quality games. They have to either sell the games to big publishers or implement ad revenues which again decreases retention.“The mobile gaming ecosystem in India is transforming rapidly but monetization remains the biggest roadblock, said Paavan Nanda, Cofounder, WinZO Games.He further added that India leads the world in mobile game downloads followed by the United States and Brazil, according to App Annie.“However, there is dismal growth in consumer spend on games. This indicates the need for a stable monetization model in India for game developers to support and promote quality gaming content,” he said.Singh also pointed out that more people are creating games. In 2018, there were five billion unique games launched, of which, 50 percent were generated from India.A KPMG report says that India had 275 game development companies in 2019 as opposed to a mere 25 back in 2010."

title,Algorithmic Trading Strategies: Pair Trading & Mean Reversion Strategies
datetime,2020-01-13 10:30:00+00:00
description,"A look at cover pairs trading for stocks, a statistical arbitrage strategy, which is based on the mean reversion principle for Algo trading."
content,"Nitesh KhandelwalIn the previous article, you learned one of the most popular quantitative trading strategies: momentum trading . In this article, we will cover pair trading for stocks, a statistical arbitrage strategy, which is based on the mean reversion principle.Let’s start with the first component.How to choose stocks for pair trading?The first step in choosing a pair is to analyse the stocks qualitatively. Generally, we select a pair of companies from the same sector, for example, Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank. It could be further refined based on other factors like companies with similar size or market capitalization such as ACC and Ambuja Cement or companies managed by the same management such as Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv. After qualitative analysis, you can apply statistical and mathematical tools to finalize the pairs to trade. Stationarity is one of the properties of time series, which is a prerequisite for pairs trading.What is a stationary time series?A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties does not change over time. If the time series is stationary, you can profit from the mean-reverting strategy, buy low and sell high. For individual stocks, the time series of stock prices are generally not stationary.NoneYou can create a portfolio of two price series such that the linear combination of these is stationary. If the linear combination of two price series is stationary, then the individual price series is said to be co-integrated with each other.NoneLet’s say there are two stocks A and B. Linear combination of these two stocks can be defined asSpread = y - m *xHere, y and x are prices of stock A and B respectively and m is the number of stocks of B you sold for each stock of A that you bought.If the above equation is stationary, then we can say that stock A and B are co-integrated with each other, and you can implement mean reversion strategy by going long on one stock and selling the other stock.NoneBut the question is, how do we know whether two stocks are co-integrated or not. You can use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) to test the co-integration of two price series. The idea behind the ADF test is to first determine the optimal hedge ratio (the value of ‘n’ in the spread equation) by running a linear regression between two price series. Using this hedge ratio, we complete the equation of the spread and then finally run the ADF test on this to determine if the spread is stationary or not.ADF test is a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the portfolio is not stationary, and the alternative hypothesis is that the portfolio is stationary. When we run the ADF test on a portfolio, it gives the value of test statistics and critical value at a different confidence level. If the test statistic is less than the critical value at a certain confidence level, then we can reject the null hypothesis that the portfolio is not stationary which means the portfolio is stationary at the given confidence level. However, the results of ADF test are order dependent. That is, the results will vary based on which stock is set as y and which stock as x while computing the spread. If you want to get order independent results then you can use Johansen Test.Determine entry and exit pointsAfter finding the cointegrated pair of stocks, you need to determine the entry and exit points. You can enter and exit the position by creating bands, similar to Bollinger bands, around the spread. Bollinger bands consist of three bands. The upper band is ‘x’ standard deviations above the moving average of the spread, the middle band is the moving average of the spread, and the lower band is ‘x’ standard deviations below the moving average of the spread.One of the entry & exit approaches can be to buy the spread whenever the spread crosses below the lower Bollinger band and exit the position when it reaches to the middle band. Similarly, if spread crosses above the upper Bollinger band, then sell the spread and exit the position when it reaches to the middle band.Pairs trading often hedges market risk to a certain extent from adverse market movements, i.e. make the strategy market neutral. However, in some cases, spread doesn’t revert to the mean. To prevent such an unexpected event, we need to place a stop loss. For example, if we choose entry signals at 2-sigma, we are expecting that the spread will revert to the mean from this threshold. However, let’s say the spread continues to move away from the mean. In such scenarios, to prevent losses, you can place a stop loss say at 3-sigma. You can set the threshold based on your risk appetite or based on the average loss of losing trades in the backtest. Sometimes cointegration between pairs breaks for an extended period. Trading pairs during this period led to an unprofitable trade. It is recommended to exit the position in such scenarios. But you can continue paper trading these pairs to see when cointegration is turning around.This is the basic framework for pairs trading. You can apply the same concept on a universe of stocks and generate potential stock pairs. You can even backtest pairs trading strategy on ACC and Ambuja Cements on QuantraBlueshift for free, by selecting the template Pairs Trading Strategy.Hope this gives you a good insight into the world of pair trading & statistical arbitrage. In the next article we will be sharing domain insights into the algorithmic & quantitative trading space to help you #GoAlgo!"

title,How RBI’s MANI app for the visually challenged helps identify currency denominations
datetime,2020-01-09 08:56:00+00:00
description,"A visually challenged person can scan and identify the denominations by checking the front or reverse side of a currency note, including folded notes"
content,"On January 1, 2020 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) launched a mobile app for visually and /or hearing impaired people to identify the denomination of currency notes. Called the Mobile Aided Note Identifier (MANI), it seeks to help such people who faced various problems in accessing the new and old currency notes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified, however, that the MANI app does not authenticate a currency note as genuine or counterfeit while scanning them.Using the app, a visually challenged person can scan and identify the denominations by checking the front or reverse side of a currency note, including folded notes. The app also works offline to scan and identify the denominations of currency notes once it is installed.Using the MANI appDownload the MANI app on to your smart phone. Just make sure that you type out ‘Mobile Aided Note Identifier’ and not just MANI or some other such short form.Once you download the app, you can start using it. You do not need to open any online account or require any password to operate the app. Just give the app the permission to use the camera as it needs to scan the currency note that you aim to identify. While setting up the app, you can also select voice commands if you want assistance. Select ‘visual’ or ‘visual and hearing’ to proceed further for scanning the currency note. If you select ‘none of the above,’ the MANI application will be close automatically.When a currency denomination is to be identified, select the ‘scan currency’ option on the app. The currency note should be placed at a distance of approximately five to seven inches from the rear camera.Using this app, you can identify the denomination of the currency in three ways: text on screen, audio notification and vibration.NoneFor people with hearing and visual impairments, the app has pre-defined vibrations for different denominations; one vibration for Rs 5, two vibrations for Rs 10, three for Rs 20, four for Rs 50, five for Rs 100, six for Rs 200, seven for Rs 500 and eight for Rs 2,000. In case the app is unable to identify the denomination, it uses a long vibration and asks for the note to be scanned again.Drawbacks On social media, some of the users of the MANI app have raised concerns on the accuracy of the features offered. For instance, some of them complained saying that when they scanned a Rs 50 currency note, app showed Rs 100 on the screen; similarly, while scanning a new Rs 100 currency note, it was identified as Rs 50.We used the MANI app while working for this story and it was accurate in identifying the denominations of the currency notes while scanning.Jitendra Solanki, SEBI Registered Investment Adviser and Founder of PlanSpecialNeeds says, “It may be difficult for the visually impaired to scan every time they make payments or receive cash. Also, they may not like to scan cash in public places such as while depositing or withdrawing at the bank and at neighbourhood shops while purchasing groceries.”"

description,"Omnicuris uses video as a medium of instruction, and offers the courses for free. The platform is also interactive, allowing doctors to ask questions to experts, take part in webinars, quizzes, assignments and assessments, among other things."
content,"Dr JC Sekar is a general practitioner who runs a typical rural primary care nursing home with a pathology laboratory and an attached X-ray unit in a village called Vadamadurai, around 17 km from Dindigul in Tamil Nadu.With a heavy outpatient load and demanding hours of duty, Sekar hardly gets time to read books or browse through the internet to update his knowledge and skills related to the advances in clinical practices and patient care.Sekar said he managed to utilise whatever opportunities he got by attending the Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses conducted by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and other professional bodies to update his knowledge and skill.Sekar is still lucky as he lives in medically developed state like Tamil Nadu, but many doctors living in rural areas of some of the most backward states in India are still missing out as they have little or no access to such CME courses.India has around 9.27 lakh doctors in active service, with one doctor for every 1,457 people as per the country's current population estimate of 1.35 billion.A large proportion of those doctors are general physicians and consultant physicians that provide critical primary care in rural and semi-urban areas. With increasing advances in the medical field, physicians need to constantly update their medical knowledge to provide the highest quality of care to their patients.The continuing medical education (CME) courses, sponsored by government, professional medical bodies, medical universities, pharmaceutical and medical devices industry, has become an important source of educational activity for doctors.The Medical Council of India (MCI) established a code of ethics stating that members should complete 30 hours of CME every five years in order to re-register as doctors. This though, is not legally binding.It costs about Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 per doctor for travel and accommodation in order to CME course, not to mention the time involved. The sponsors of these courses are now approaching online education-technology platforms like Omnicuris to design and deliver CME courses for these doctors.Going digital is not only convenient, but also saves precious resources like money and time, which can be well spent on other more pressing problems of healthcare.Founded by Savitha Kuttan and Priyank Jain in November 2016, the Bengaluru-based startup has emerged as the leading online CME provider that has been upskilling doctors.Omnicuris uses video as a medium of instruction, and offers the courses for free. The platform is also interactive, allowing doctors to ask questions to experts, take part in webinars, quizzes, assignments and assessments, among other things. The platform also provides certification to participants from medical universities and professional bodies.""Around 70 percent of the diseases can be treated at primary care physicians like GPs and CPs. This is a segment that needs to be trained and upskilled to identify and treat diseases at early stage in order to reduce the burden on tertiary care, which is expensive for patients and payers,"" said Kuttan.Governments and medical councils of various states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi,Punjab, West Bengal, among others have partnered with Omnicuris for continuing medical education of doctors in their respective states.""We have more than one lakh doctors registered on our platform, the plan is to scale it up to two and half lakh,"" Kuttan said.While Omnicuris doesn't charge individual doctors but makes money from the sponsors like state governments, medical associations and professional bodies who fund CME courses for doctors."

title,Five changes that will disrupt the Indian banking sector in 2020
datetime,2020-01-07 19:21:00+00:00
description,A comprehensive report from Deloitte looks into the core areas that firms need to keep an eye on.
content,"Banking has witnessed a significant change in recent times. Owing to the increasing consumer expectancies, regulations, economic changes and constant competition, modern banking has embraced technology. Digital platforms, mobile, internet banking, and payments bank have revolutionized the sector in a substantial way. “The Digital India Moment” has also given the much-needed impetus to the digitization efforts in the banking sector.Deloitte, a multinational professional service and one of the Big fours, studied these fluctuations in financial structure and banking landscape and recently released a report “Banking on the Future: Vision 2020” along with the Confederation of Indian Industry. The report highlights the role of technology in banking and how technology-oriented innovation will disrupt the market.Here are the five crucial changes that will disrupt the Indian banking sector in 2020, according to Deloitte.1. Payment banks to pave the wayThe report highlights the growing importance of payment banks in the ecosystem. In India’s cash based economy, digital payment instruments will drive growth in non-cash payments. PBs will have long term implications on the syntax of large financial institutions as they disintermediate the value chain, by leveraging innovations in “Financial Technology”, investing in innovations, and lowering transaction costs—the report highlights. The reports also states that “Digital footprint” will be the way forward for all PBs. How well PBs engage in coopetition with Fintech startups playing in emerging technologies will determine how they can differentiate in an increasingly crowded market.2. Role of Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence will be an integral part of smart banking. Banks can expand their consumer base by learning what clicks with their users. Cognitive technology with AI can offer features like cognitive engagement, cognitive automation, cognitive perceptions, and cognitive strategy formation. Through AI, a support system can be developed that targets the user’s personal preferences, reduces human intervention, catches data patterns and devises strategies based on market subtilities.One such example is Bank of America that has introduced the chatbot ‘Erica’ for customer assistance.3. Blockchain & Distributed Ledger TechnologyThe concept of the banking system with Distributed Ledgers supported by Blockchain will no longer be far-fetched. This step can initiate an uninterrupted and fairly tamperproof information inter-changes between the involved parties in real-time. Through a distributed network of computers, a common pool of information is maintained. However, transactions are unassailable and inviolable due to cryptographic algorithms. The financial services industry may be one of the firsts to be impacted by wider adoption of Blockchain and its associated DLT, the report says.4. Cyber Security: Upping the anteProliferation of internet and mobile banking is posing new security challenges to financial services firms across the globe. Security measures are present in the form of KYC, 2 step authentication and EMV chip cards. However, the game needs to be upped with looming threats like phishing fraud, app misuse, cyber intrusion, magnetic strip duplicating of cards and so on. The report underscores the need for enhanced cyber risk assessment framework and testing methodology to continuously detect and protect against evolving cyber threats.5. Increasing use-cases of RPA:"

title,Six avenues to reduce your tax outgo
datetime,2020-01-07 17:30:00+00:00
description,Know the various provisions that can help you optimise tax benefits on offer
content,"Now that the New Year celebrations are behind us, it’s time to focus on another annual ritual that stirs contrasting emotions: making tax-saving investments. It is a tedious, yet unavoidable task. The months of January and February are especially crucial for salaried employees, given that they have to submit proofs of their tax-saving investments to their employers. While you can make these investments by March 31 and claim a refund, missing your employer’s deadline will result in disproportionate tax deduction during the next three months.Ideally, your tax planning should start in April, right at the beginning of the financial year. If you haven’t been able to do so, do not fret. A bit of homework can help you maximise the tax breaks, while minimising the strain on your finances.This is particularly important for tax-payers whose gross income is just over Rs 5 lakh. The Interim Budget 2019-20 announced a rebate on tax paid for those earning up to Rs 5 lakh. However, even those whose income levels are a slightly above Rs 5 lakh can escape the tax net by fully utilising the tax benefits. For example, an individual with a total  income of Rs 7.5 lakh can exhaust the Rs 1.5 lakh investment limit under section 80C and make a contribution of Rs 50,000 to National Pension System (NPS) to reduce her taxable income to Rs 5.5 lakh. This, coupled with the new standard deduction limit of Rs 50,000, can bring her actual tax outgo down to zero.Here are six measures to minimise your tax payable:Consider contributing to VPFApart from the mandatory deduction of 12 per cent of your basic salary as employees’ provident fund (EPF) contribution, you can voluntarily earmark a higher amount. This amount will be eligible for deductions under section 80C, just like your compulsorily deducted contribution. Currently, EPF fetches 8.65 per cent tax-free return annually, which is applicable to VPF contributions too. The rate of return is declared by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) every year. “On this front, it scores over other debt instruments in the 80C basket offering fixed returns such as the public provident fund (PPF), five-year tax-saver fixed deposits and national savings certificates (NSC),” says Kuldip Kumar, Tax Partner, PwC.NoneThe drawback? The funds will be locked in till your retirement, though partial withdrawals are permitted for purposes such as funding medical treatment, house acquisition and financing higher education. Therefore, choose this option only as part of your larger retirement planning strategy. Also, evaluate your finances and goals to ensure that you will not need these funds to meet liquidity needs in the short-term.Partly prepay your housing loanPartly prepaying your housing loan, particularly if the interest rate is high, could be a better option than making additional investments, assuming your PF and current principal repaid cannot exhaust the 80C limit.While most banks have reduced interest rates recently, many older borrowers whose loans are linked to erstwhile internal benchmarking regimes, continue to pay much higher interest rates. Such borrowers can look at making part-prepayments to exhaust the Rs 1.5-lakh limit. Remember, the deduction on annual home loan interest paid is restricted to Rs 2 lakh. Often, the loan amounts are in excess of Rs 25 lakh.NoneAssuming an interest rate of 8.25 per cent and a 20-year tenure, the annual interest outgo on a Rs 30-lakh loan is well over Rs 2 lakh in the first seven years. “Such individuals can consider housing loan prepayment as a smart deduction under section 80C. Apart from the tax deduction, they can also save on the annual interest on the amount repaid,” says Pune-based chartered accountant Parixit Mishra. Small amounts prepaid, particularly in the initial years, can go a long way in maximising the benefits and reducing the overall interest outgo.Invest in NPSYou can look at investing in the NPS (national pension system) even if you are already an EPFO subscriber. The scheme has become more investor-friendly over the years and continues to evolve. Now, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India (PFRDA) is considering a proposal to allow systematic withdrawals from NPS at maturity (when the subscriber turns 60) as an option.  At present, 60 per cent of lump-sum withdrawal at maturity is tax-free but the rest has to be compulsorily used to buy annuities. Annuity income is taxable.There are three ways of claiming deductions on NPS contribution made. For one, you can take the benefits under section 80C [that is, 80CCD(1)], as part of the overall Rs 1.5-lakh limit on investments made by you. Second, you can make an additional investment of up to Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B). This apart, if your employer contributes up to 10 per cent of your basic salary to the NPS, the amount will be eligible for deduction under section 80CCD(2). However, choose this avenue only if you intend to invest towards your retirement, and will not need the money in the short term. The NPS corpus will get locked in till you turn 60, with premature part-withdrawal being permitted after three years for reasons such as critical illnesses, children’s education and marriage and house acquisition.Claim deductions on group top-up premiumSeveral employers today allow their employees to add a top-up health cover to the base policy offered. They also facilitate health covers for parents that employees can voluntarily opt for, as many employers restrict the coverage to employees’ spouse and children. In both cases, the premium amount is typically deducted from the salary every month. “Go through your organisation’s policies carefully. If your Form-16 does not factor it in, you can claim deduction under section 80D on the amount paid by you,” informs Mishra. Under section 80D, you can claim a deduction of up to Rs 25,000 on health insurance premium paid for self, spouse and dependent children. If you are paying premiums for your parents, too, you will be eligible for an additional deduction up to Rs 25,000, which can go up to Rs 50,000 in case they happen to be senior citizens. So, total tax benefit for individuals over the age of 60 who are also servicing their parents’ health premiums, can be as high as Rs 1 lakh.Pay for parents’ medical expensesHealth expenses, particularly for the elderly, have been mounting over the years. And, many senior citizens do not have a health insurance policy to cover these bills. Such individuals and their children, who are taking care of the expenses, are provided tax breaks under section 80D. “Such amounts should be incurred on the health of the assessee, her spouse, dependent children or parents, whose age is 60 years or more,” explains Sandeep Sehgal, Director, Tax & Regulatory, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP. However, these exemptions cannot be claimed if they do not have a health policy. “If a senior citizen assessee has incurred medical expenditure of over Rs 50,000 for himself as well as for senior citizen parents, then deduction of Rs 1 lakh can be claimed.”Bought an electric car?

title,"Banks staring at fresh NPA whammy on farm loan waivers, faulty Kisan Credit Card model"
datetime,2020-01-07 13:33:00+00:00
description,"The size of the Maharashtra loan waiver, announced by the new coalition government, could work out to around Rs 51,000 crore."
content,"Banks—mainly public sector ones—are bracing for a fresh wave of bad loan shock if politicians cite Maharashtra as an example to waive off farm loans on a large scale in other states. Banks growing exposure to the agriculture sector, through the problematic lending model of Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), is making matters worse.The size of the Maharashtra loan waiver, announced by the new coalition government, could work out to around Rs 51,000 crore. The government has promised to waive off loans upto Rs 2 lakhs. Going by the rule book, banks will have to classify these loans as non-performing assets as they will not be getting their money back on schedule.Agriculture NPAs alone amount to Rs 1.1 lakh crore at present. Accounting for the Rs 3.14 lakh crores of loans waived off over the last decade, the total NPA burden for banks could be as much as staggering Rs 4.2 lakh crores, according to a research by SBI economists. Now, add the potential Maharashtra loan waiver amount, and the figure could well be around Rs 4.7 lakh crores.Further pain for PSBs?Ironically, banks are set to suffer a double whammy because these entities are already struggling for capital to lend after the massive bank NPA clean up exercise. Further bad loan shocks from loan waivers complicates matters for the banks. That’s because a fiscally constrained central government may not in a position to fund public sector banks next fiscal. This fiscal so far, the government has already front-loaded much of the Rs70,000 crore capital infusion it has promised to banks. But there is no clarity if PSBs can expect such generosity next year.Credit culture gone for a tossLoan waivers don’t just impact the finances of state-run banks; they have a prolonged effect on the credit culture of borrowers. This was evident during the 2010 microfinance crisis when politicians exhorted people not to repay loans. Once a loan waiver is promised, even honest borrowers typically stop repayments of loans adding to the woes of banks. Farm loan waiver is always an easy tool for the vote hungry politician; a promise by the politician to the farmer that their loans will be written off in exchange of votes.Now, who wouldn’t like to have a share of freebies? The winning politician then uses taxpayers’ money to repay these loans to banks, thus straining fiscal positions of state governments. But banks do not get money on time from governments, and this forces them to go slow on further lending to farmers.The KCC problemEven more worrying is the rising exposure of banks to Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) loans. Farmers are supposed to use this money for productive purposes such as buying of farm equipment or fertilizer. But, in many cases, they use it for unproductive consumption purposes. The big problem with KCC is that the limit upto which the farmer can draw money is flexible. Farmers often make very less repayment, just enough to keep the account standard.This loan, in effect, keeps getting rolled over or evergreened for years. At the end of March, 2019, the KCC loans aggregated to about Rs 6.68 lakh crore, constituting about 60 percent of the total agricultural loans given by them, the SBI report highlights. KCC payments also suffer on account of crop losses, faulty pricing system of  produce leading to heavy losses for the farmer and natural calamities. The KCC Model, as the SBI report warns, needs to be re-examined closely."

title,Outlook 2020-29: Will the outperforming sectors of last decade continue their run?
datetime,2020-01-07 14:24:00+00:00
description,"Sets of data show that over the calendar year 2009-2019, the Indian market delivered the second-best returns after the US in the pecking order of world markets."
content,"The Indian market had a bumpy ride during the decade 2009-19 as a host of global and domestic factors put the market on shaky ground.BSE Sensex rose 136 percent while Nifty saw a gain of 134 percent in the last ten years. BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices have seen a rise of 123 percent and 136 percent, respectively, in the same period.Data shows that over the calendar years 2009-2019, the Indian market delivered the second-best growth rate in returns after the US in the pecking order of world markets.However, in dollar terms, Japan and Taiwan markets’ performance was better than India’s, given the underlying rupee depreciation against the US dollar.As per Motilal Oswal Financial Services, over CY09-19, Nifty delivered an 8.9 percent return CAGR, mirroring the Nifty earnings per share (EPS) CAGR of 8.2 percent over that period.Even these tepid returns were driven by a few select sectors like BFSI, consumer, IT, pharma and automobiles, while the rest of the sectors belonging to the investment side of the economy (capital goods, cement, real estate, power) and commodities (metals, oil & gas) underperformed massively.This has created a significant divergence in the valuations of these sectors which exacerbated in the last three years.NoneAt this juncture, it seems pertinent to ponder if the trend will continue in the current decade as well.Most experts and analysts are positive on the Indian market for the long term and are of the view that the consumer sector will extend its growth story in the current decade.Let's take a look at how some of the experts expect the new decade to be for the Indian market.Expert: Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Group""The growth story of the last decade could be summed up as the story of consumption. In fact, the consumption story in India is core to economic growth and likely to continue driven by demographic changes and rising middle-class population. So, consumer discretionary, consumer durables, auto and financial space will continue to grow at attractive rates for the next decade too,"" said Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research at Ashika Group.Within the consumption sector, however, there would be disruption driven by digital initiatives and artificial intelligence. Besides, climate change will also play its part in bringing in new farming techniques and water infrastructure, said Bothra.Demand for clean energy, electric vehicles will lead to disruption in the auto sector. An aging worldwide population over the next decade will throw a plethora of opportunities for healthcare companies. Also for a growing country like India long-term potential of the sectors should be looked at in the context of per-capita consumption which remains quite low in comparison to developed countries, hence a long way to go.Moreover, for banks, growth is tied to the growth in the economy and the quantum of incremental GDP growth, both of which require massive funding in the next decade. Banks and financial institutions would be in a sweet spot to fund the growth of India Inc.For metal, while the demand drivers certainly don’t look robust at this point in time, the sector is unlikely to repeat the past decade’s performance.The real estate sector has battled various challenges in the last decade (high inventory, low demand and heavy leverage) and with the formalization of the sector (RERA), organized players will continue to grow on the back of demand for affordable housing projects.The telecom sector has probably seen its lows and the year 2020 has already marked at a revival for the players with revision in the tariff structure.The demand for power sector has better drivers in the next decade than the previous one driven by an increase in penetration of consumer durables, demand for clean energy and electric vehicles.Moreover, for capex heavy business, value creation depends on the return on equity higher than the cost of capital for a sustainable period of time and for the sectors mentioned above, leaving apart certain well managed, low-cost producers, scale, etc., majority of the companies falls short of these criteria and hence underperformance.The best way is to participate in the upswing with respect to changing business dynamics and wild operating profit swings because of leverage and attempting to capitalize at the peak of the cycle.To put things in perspective is the mean return from Indian equities as an asset class for long-term has been in the range of 12 percent to 16 percent and the outperformance can be construed as a couple of basis points above the averages.Expert: Narendra Solanki, Head of Fundamental Research (Investment Services) - AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock BrokersWhat we should keep in mind is that markets operate in cycles, and also keep in mind what were the precursor events few years prior to any start of a decade which helps you in adjusting your expectations for future returns.As far as the next decade is concerned, firstly, we think growth would definitely be there and the Indian economy is poised to grow at least around 7 percent CAGR and with long-term inflation of 4 percent its nominal growth could be around 10 percent-13 percent range.Secondly, our view is that the Indian economy is currently under transformation and one can already see some disruption led by technology under process. Now, our current listed space is not able to capture this new space as there are very few companies listed right now.Keeping these two points in mind we think it is justified as of now to start with a lower adjusted CAGR number which could be more realistic and have room for upwards revision down the line.Coming to the sectors, consumer, financials, technology and healthcare should continue to do better, including autos.Even we look forward to one theme which is fast emerging in various sectors which are mired by lack of transparency due to the nature of business and higher cash transactions.We believe the current wave of disruptions on the consumer payments side should also add to earnings by way of higher transparency and compliance in sectors like road toll Infra, Healthcare, Power distribution, Realty, etc. to name a few.Metals, real estate, power and telecom are the sectors that are highly exposed to policymaking, global macro, political risks, etc. So, these continue to remain volatile and in between, you could see good returns.From the long-term perspective, we definitely are going to see them grow in terms of volumes and expansion but in valuation terms too much depends on macro market structure and stability. So, investors could have them at lower allocations if at all and then gradually build up as things improve.A CAGR of anything around 12-15 percent should be decent for the coming decade from above-discussed sectors keeping in mind that we start off with already low inflation and moderate base in terms of valuations and few even at somewhat higher base and also if you see long term G-Sec rates and compare it than even at these rates one outperforms by handsome margins.Expert: Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance SecuritiesThe consumer sector will continue to perform in the next decade also but more likely at a slower pace than the previous decade.Banks should deliver similar performance as the previous decade. Technology and Healthcare are more likely to be mixed bags with certain stocks outperforming the market and some laggards.Autos could still outperform the market considering the under penetration in the sector.Metals are cyclical and predicting the performance for an entire decade poses a challenge. However, Real estate and Telecom are likely to deliver good returns in the next considering the peak of the industry challenges are behind and the market has seen immense consolidation.The power sector has many challenges and there is tremendous value but more often than not the sector has proven to be a value trap. We believe the sector will continue to reel under pressure and may not perform up to the expectations.We estimate the broader market to deliver nearly 11 percent return for the next decade."

title,Nirbhaya case: What is causing the delay in hanging the rapists?

description," January 17, President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy plea "
content,"NoneNoneThe order will cause yet another delay in the execution of the death sentence of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case. What is the status as of now, and what is causing the delay, let’s find out:What has happened so far?The Supreme Court had, in December 2019, rejected the review petition of one of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case. The apex court, in July 2018, had rejected the review pleas of the other three. With the latest dismissal, the review pleas of all four convicts stand dismissed.The same day, a trial court in Delhi, had said that it will give its ruling on the petition, filed by Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi and the Delhi government, to expedite the procedure for hanging the convicts on January 7.On January 7, the court issued death warrants for the four rapists and set the date for hanging as January 22. The court directed the four to be executed at 7 am in Tihar Jail, where they are currently lodged.NoneHaving exhausted all legal remedies, Mukesh Kumar Singh has now resorted to the ultimate recourse, and filed a mercy plea before the President.Why the delay?The delay in execution of the death sentence can be attributed to the many safeguards bestowed upon a convict before he faces the noose.As per procedure, the convicts have the legal right to challenge a lower court’s verdict in the High Court; and then the Supreme Court, which is the top-most court. After conviction by the Supreme Court, a criminal can file a review petition in order to appeal against the apex court’s order. If the review petition is also dismissed, the convict can go for the penultimate legal resort – a curative petition.The ultimate resort, after the apex court dismisses the curative petition, is to file a mercy plea or clemency petition with the President. This process is provided under Article 72 of the Constitution and allows the President of India “to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions” awarded by the courts.NoneHowever, the Article doesn’t mention any prescribed procedure to deal with mercy petitions or any time frame within which the President must act upon them.In addition, under the prison rules, if death sentence has been awarded to more than one person in a case and if one of them moves a mercy plea, the execution of the others too has to be postponed till the plea is decided.When the Delhi government informed the aforementioned law to the court, a bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal retorted saying, ""Then your rule is bad if you cannot take action till all the co-convicts have moved a mercy plea. It seems there has been non-application of mind (while framing the rules). The system is suffering from cancer.""The prison authorities said that under the rules, they will have to wait for the mercy plea to be decided before executing the death warrant.Where does that leave Nirbhaya’s case?As of now, the order to hang the convicts on January 22 has been stayed. The Delhi government has already rejected the mercy petition, and forwarded it to Lt Governor Anil Baijal.Baijal had again recommended that the mercy petition be rejected, and forwarded his plea to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which then sent it to the President of India, who has rejected Mukesh Kumar Singh's mercy plea.NoneAn MHA official told PTI, “The Home Ministry has received the mercy petition from the LG recommending its rejection. The petition is being examined and an appropriate decision will be taken soon.""Meanwhile, a Delhi court has asked the Tihar Jail authorities to file a report by January 17 about the status of the scheduled execution of the convicts.Can the courts intervene?"

Lala was a respected figure in the Pathan community. Therefore, Pathans across the country used to come and meet him. And so did leaders and prominent personalities,"" Raut had later said."

content,"NoneChetak is the first of many electric models planned by Bajaj Auto, including that under partner KTM and Husqvarna brands. Deliveries of the Chetak with six colour and two variants will commence from February-end.Bookings open on January 15 at Rs 2,000. Around 13 dealerships in Bengaluru and four dealerships in Pune will house the Chetak.Designed on the lines of the original Chetak, the popular geared scooter of the 1960s and 70s, the battery-powered scooter has been designed and developed in-house by Bajaj Auto.Chetak comes powered with a 4kW motor that gets its fuel from a 3KwH lithium ion battery pack. The management claims that the Chetak can run for a maximum of 95km before needing a recharge under real riding conditions.Standard test conditions as checked by the government-controlled testing agency ARAI revealed a mileage of as much as 150km, company officials said.The Chetak offers two drive modes -- eco and sport -- and a reverse assist mode. There is also a regenerative braking system that converts braking heat into kinetic energy, thereby maximising its range. Chetak's top speed is around 80 km per hour.The Chetak will face limited competition in the form of indigenously developed Ather 450 and the upcoming Benling Aura, considering the specifications that Chetak has.Its battery will take five-to-six hours to get fully charged. There is no option of a fast charge. Moreover, the batteries are not swappable and cannot be removed for charging purposes. One hour of charging will provide a charge of 25 percent.The Chetak will make use of a standard five amp electric socket for power, similar to that used by a cellphone. The battery is charged using a standard household 5-15 amp electrical outlet, which will come as complimentary.The Chetak features a horseshoe shaped LED headlight with DRLs, feather touch activated electronic switches and sequential scrolling LED blinkers. A large digital console intuitively displays vehicle information.Chetak has been embedded with mobility solutions like data communication, security and user authentication. A mobile app will provide a comprehensive overview of its ride history.NoneBajaj Auto invested more than two years to develop the Chetak. The management declined to specify the investment made on its development. The company has around 1,000 people working in its R&D wing and a majority of them have worked on the Chetak"

content,"NoneIn November, the Hinduja-backed lender had announced that it had finalised the candidate for Sobti's replacement. The lender is awaiting the banking regulator's approval on the same, which is likely to come by the end of this month. The bank's consumer banking head Sumant Kathpalia is believed to be the only name that has been proposed to the regulator.Sobti, under whose tenure the bank saw three major business acquisitions, said that the bank has already begun working on its next phase of growth. He said that a group of 80 bank officials will be meeting next week to chalk out the plan.""Not an individual, not even the management team, but 80 people will get together to work on the future of the bank in terms of a three-year plan"" said Sobti, adding that the number has grown from five officials back in 2008 when he took over.""Continuity of thought and action comes out of the fact that so many people buy into a certain philosophy and not individuals,"" said Sobti.Sobti indicated his wish to continue to be ""strongly"" associated with the financial sector after he ends his 12 year stint at the bank, and dismissed any talks about being associated with the bank in any manner.The private lender reported 32 percent year-on-year growth in profit after tax for the October-December period despite higher provisions, which was the last full quarter of business under Sobti's tenure.The bank accelerated provisioning, which included providing Rs 240 crore against two accounts--a housing finance company and a travel company--that were recognised as fraud in the third quarter.""We've preempted (provisioning) in terms of recognising them as frauds proactively. We've made provisions as per regulatory requirements. There may be more in the quarters to come. So it may not be one-time,"" Sobti said.""Individual banks can take the decision to classify as fraud and that is what we have done. Now, if others follow or not follow, we have to see. We're the first to declare"" Sobti said while refering to the housing finance company account.Also, Sobti said that the net slippages were slightly high as ""a particular travel related account"" was recognised in the third quarter.The bank's slippages increased significantly to Rs 1,945 crore in third quarter, up from Rs 1,102 crore in the previous quarter. The bank's provisioning coverage ratio rose to 53 percent in third quarter, up from 50 percent in the previous quarter, and 43 percent in the same period last year.It's asset quality improved for the quarter that ended on December 2019, with gross non-performing assets (NPA) falling to 2.18 percent, down from 2.19 percent in previous quarter. Net NPAs also declined to 1.05 percent during the quarter against 1.12 percent in the previous quarter.However, the bank clocked healthy credit growth of 20 percent and deposit growth of 23 percent in the third quarter. The credit growth was driven by 44 percent jump in loans given to microfinance sector, Sobti said."

title,How dual regulation is worsening the mess at India’s opaquely run co-operative banks
datetime,2020-01-20 15:25:00+00:00
description,"To save India’s broken co-operative banks waiting to implode, current laws needs to be changed to give the power of regulation to a single regulator; the RBI is most suited for the job."
content,"India’s problematic co-operative banks may have more skeletons in the closets, waiting to tumble out. For nearly two years, there has been no proper scrutiny of the accounts of many cooperative banks, including Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), due to dual regulation and political involvement at state-level.“You have a problem when you don’t have clarity on who does what and you are unwilling to own up mistakes when things go wrong. Too many cooks spoil the broth,” said an RBI official on condition of anonymity. Regulation of UCBs is split between RBI and centre/state-governments, while that of smaller co-operative banks is divided between National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and state governments.NoneRBI or government?RBI does regulate these banks but only partly. It does not have full powers as these entities also come under the government's purview. For instance, when it comes to taking the stock of operations, the Registrar of Co-operative Society (RCS) is the primary authority on behalf of government. Typically an IAS official on the verge of retirement, the RCS is entrusted with conducting regular scrutiny of these banks and compiling the numbers. But politicians at state-levels dominate the running of these banks, and the RCSs are either powerless or in cahoots with the powers-that-be.According to the latest available data on RBI site, India has 1,551 urban co-operative banks (UCBs) at end-March 2018. These banks managed Rs 4.5 lakh crore deposits at end March, 2018. At state-level, there are three types of cooperative banks--primary credit co-operative banks, district level cooperative banks and state-level cooperative banks. As on end March, 2017, there were about 33 state co-operative banks with Rs1.2 lakh crore deposits and , 370 district central co-operative banks (Rs3.3 lakh crore deposits) and 95,595 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (Rs1.15 lakh crore deposits).PMC effectThe PMC bank which was superseded by the RBI last year after it was found that the bank was running fraudulent transactions for several years to facilitate lending to HDIL through fictitious accounts and violating single-party lending rules. The bank had Rs11,600 core deposits. RBI imposed restrictions on deposit withdrawals and superseded its board after the fraud was caught. Last week, the Bombay High Court constituted a committee to sell HDIL assets and repay depositors.But it doesn’t stop there. Instances of co-operative banks coming under RBI scanner, mostly due to financial irregularities or poor performance, has been rising over the years. Almost every month, the RBI put some or other co-operative bank under restrictions. It was only after the PMC bank case, the RBI started taking strict action.The RBI has now asked UCBs to report details on borrowers with exposure of Rs5 crore and above, also when the bank writes off loans worth that amount. “Banks are advised to take utmost care about data accuracy and integrity while submitting the data on large credits to the Reserve Bank of India, failing which penal action would be undertaken,” said the central bank.After PMC, it imposed restrictions to Bangalore-based Guru Raghavendra Sahakara (Cooperative) Bank Niyamitha, on 10 January, from renewing loans and deposits. The bank was also asked not let withdrawals beyond Rs35,000 per account. Similar restrictions were imposed on Kolkata’s Kolikata Mahila Cooperative Bank Ltd with deposit withdrawal restrictions of Rs 1000 per account.There are several other such examples.Not just UCBsThe problem of dual regulation or lack of efficient regulation is not just limited to UCBs, but extends to rural co-operative banks as well. Even rural co-operative banks, which are regulated by RCS and National Bank of Agriculture Development (NABARD), are run opaquely. Here too, for the last two years, no data on the business of these banks are available.“These banks are mostly run by politicians and monitored by RCS. There is often a turf war on who does the job. There are no numbers available for the last two years,” a NABARD official said.To save India’s broken co-operative banks waiting to implode, the current laws needs to be changed to give powers to a single regulator; the RBI is most suited for the job. The sooner the government does it, the better. Else, there will be more skeletons tumbling out of the closet."

content,"German auto giant Mercedes-Benz could become the first luxury carmaker to launch a fully-electric vehicle in India when it commercially launches the EQC, a battery-powered sports utility vehicle (SUV) in April.The five-seater SUV is one of the several new electric vehicles being planned by Mercedes for India. While the EQC will become the flagship model, there are plans to introduce the EQA, a compact EV, in India that could become the base EV for the company.Pricing of the EQC will be revealed in April. but, considering it will be a fully-imported product, it will be slapped with heavy import taxes. However, GST will be at 5 percent. Launched in the US a few months ago, the EQC is priced at $67,900, undercutting the Audi E-Tron and the Jaguar I-Pace.“The global plan is to have at least ten battery electric products by 2022. We have the option of choosing and getting whichever model is suitable for India. And we also need to look if we should get them through the assembly route or through the imported route,” said Martin Schwenk, MD and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India.While Audi has committed to bringing in the E-Tron electric vehicle to India, Mercedes’ closest rival BMW has not yet fully firmed up any plans of launching EVs in India. Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover has stated plans of getting the Jaguar I-Pace in the second half of the year. Volvo will launch its first fully-electric vehicle built on the XC40 in 2021-22.“The ‘EQ’ brand is a key pillar of our ‘Sustainable Luxury’ objective and is the first dedicated luxury electric brand in India. We felt the time was right to introduce EQ brand in India and our first product for India will be the EQC,” added Schwenk.Like every EQC, the EQC Edition 1886 has a water-cooled on-board charger (OBC) with an output of 7.4 kW and is therefore ready for charging with alternating current (AC) at home and at public charging stations.Charging with a Mercedes-Benz Wallbox is up to three times faster than at a domestic power socket. It is even faster with DC charging – which is the standard for the EQC, with a suitable market-specific plug. Depending on the SoC (Status of Charge), the EQC can be charged with a maximum output of up to 110 kW at an appropriate charging station."

description,"Just as you can claim deduction on principal repaid under section 80C, section 24(b) gives tax relief on interest paid during the year"
content,"Your residence – whether owned, rented or leased out – can give you to a range of tax benefits. Be it interest paid and principal repaid on a housing loan or rent paid to your landlord, the Income Tax Act allows deductions and breaks under various sections. In the last few years, several tax incentives have been announced – and some withdrawn. Here’s your guide to the tax breaks on offer currently.Home loan principal repaidThe most widely-known section, section 80C, allows tax-payers to claim deductions on a host of avenues, including on investments made in equity-linked saving schemes (ELSS), public provident fund (PPF), and also on life insurance premium paid among others. The overall limit is Rs 1.5 lakh. If you are in the process of repaying your home loan – taken to fund the construction or purchase of a house occupied by you – the principal repaid during the year is entitled for deduction.In the initial years, the principal component is not sizeable and, hence, cannot help in completely exhausting the limit. It is possible that even after factoring in ongoing commitments including provident fund contribution, you will need to make additional investments to maximise the tax breaks.Interest paid on housing loanJust as you can claim deduction on principal repaid under section 80C, section 24(b) gives tax relief on interest paid during the year. This section allows deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh a year on interest paid on housing loan taken to finance a self-occupied house property. If you own two house properties and none of them are let out, both can qualify as self-occupied properties. This clause was brought about by an amendment announced in the interim Budget of 2019-20.NoneNow, the second house will not be subject to tax on deemed or notional basis if it is used as a family residence or remains vacant for the entire year due to, say, your employment at another location. However, if both have been financed by home loans, the total deduction under this section will be restricted to Rs 2 lakh a year. “Until this amendment was made, tax-payers were allowed to consider one property as self-occupied and the interest paid on the other property’s loan could be claimed as deduction separately,” explains Kuldip Kumar, Partner and Leader PwC India Global Mobility Practice.The loss (tax relief) under such provision was limited to Rs 2 lakh a year, but the balance amount – to be set off against house property – could be carried forward for eight assessment years. “Now, this tax benefit can be claimed only if you actually let out the other house property. There is no option to treat the second house as ‘deemed to be let out,” he adds.If your loan pertains to an under-construction property, you can take the tax relief on interest payment over five years, starting from the year in which the construction was completed. “If you have been paying pre-construction interest, it can also be claimed in five equal installments on a yearly basis,” says Archit Gupta, CEO and Founder, ClearTax. However, the maximum deduction is capped at Rs 2 lakh.First-time home-buyer’s interest outgoNoneThe perks of HRA"

We won’t be able to share the details of those models right now,” said Y S Guleria, senior vice president (marketing and sales), HMSI.HMSI has a bouquet of 13 motorcycle models, 10 scooter models and a moped. With the trimming down of the portfolio HMSI will lose 20 percent of its product offering.The company further warned about a continued deceleration in demand especially after the beginning of the April quarter. There is a minimum increase of 10 percent in prices of two-wheelers upgraded to BS-VI compared to today’s prices. The Activa 6G is priced 13-14 percent higher than the outgoing BS-IV model.“We are expecting demand to come back by the festive period of this year. There are no signs of any immediate revival in demand for the upcoming months,” added Guleria.The Navi, a moped-like two-wheeler targeted at the urban and rural buyer, did not achieve the kind of success expected from it. But, since the model is ‘very well received’ in a couple of Latin American markets the BS-IV version of the model will remain under production even after April 1. HMSI exports to 27 countries as of today.None"

content,"NoneAfter decades of absence from the scooter segment, Indian automobile manufacturer Bajaj has returned with a fully electric offering, the Chetak. Though the company has experience in the scooter segment, it already has a strong rival in the Bengaluru-based Ather 450. Here is how the two e-scooters compare on paper.Bajaj has equipped the Chetak with a 4.08 kW electric motor which makes 16 Nm of continuous torque. The Ather 450 gets a bigger 5.4 kW motor which makes 20 Nm of torque giving it an acceleration of 0-40 km/h in 3.9 seconds and a top speed of 80 km/h.Bajaj is yet to disclose the Chetak’s performance figures, though it is expected to perform slightly lower than the 450. The Chetak gets an average range of 95 km on a full charge, while the Ather 450 can clock 75 to 107 km.Both also get a lithium-ion battery with an IP67 rating which makes it dust and water resistant. Both bikes also get a reverse gear switch to make it easier to back out of a tight parking space.Both e-scooters support Bluetooth connectivity but the Ather 450 also gets OTA updates. Both scooters are also equipped with an LED headlamp and tail lamp but the overall design language is different. While the Chetak is designed with a conventional and retro look, the Ather is more futuristic. However, while both get touch-operated instrument clusters, the Ather has conventional buttons and toggle switches, while the Chetak gets feather touch switches on both handlebars."

Now, the British carmaker is all set to roll out its second vehicle for the Indian market, the ZS EV on January 27.Pre-bookings for the electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) have been underway for a while now on the company's website and at select dealerships for a token amount of Rs 50,000. However, bookings are set to close today and will probably start back up once the launch takes place.The car has been advertised extensively and the unveiling took place a while back, so apart from the price, we already know all there is to know about the SUV. As with the Hector, the ZS EV boasts a lengthy features list, including the connected car tech.The ZS gets an 8-inch vertical touchscreen infotainment system, keyless entry/go, electronic parking brake and automatic projector headlamps. The top-spec trim will also get a panoramic sunroof, leatherette seats, PM2.5 air filter and power-adjustable seats.In terms of safety, the SUV gets ABS with EBD and ESC as standard along with six airbags, hill-start assist, hill-descent control, rear parking camera and sensors.The ZS will be powered by a 143 PS making electric motor that churn out 353 Nm of torque. All of this will be delivered to the front wheels via a single-speed automatic gearbox. A 44.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack will power the motor and will be capable of delivering up to 340 km on a single charge.The range is the biggest factor for people considering an electric vehicle (EV) and while the MG does deliver decent range, charging infrastructure too has to be developed enough for people to forget about those troubles.To troubleshoot the issue, MG has set up fast-charging stations at some of its dealerships and is also offering to set up a 7.4 kW AC charger at its customer's houses or offices. Apart from this, the company is also providing a portable charging cable that can be used with any 15 A power socket.The MG ZS EV will be offered in two trim levels, but we would have to wait till the launch to know the prices. However, we expect an estimated Rs 22 lakh (ex-showroom) price."

He added that the volumes had gone beyond five times the bank’s estimation. “So, it’s more of a capacity issue,” he said.The private lender said that it had added more capacities and would continue to do so in the coming months.While HDFC did not specify exactly what in terms of more ‘capacities’ it will be adding, typically, a bank could require increasing the number of servers, boosting internet bandwidth apart from reviewing the existing processing capacity of its solutions, payment gateways, network monitoring and regulation.NoneHDFC Bank’s retail banking business is supported by Finware and corporate banking business by Flexcube, which are the systems developed by i-Flex Solutions. Both systems are open, scaleable and web-enabled, according to the bank.In December, the bank’s customers took to social media to complain about not being able to access their accounts online or through the bank’s mobile application, raising safety concerns.Jagdishan said that the bank was monitoring the situation closely. “I can categorically say, and we have said it to the regulator as well, that there was no cyberattack on 2 December,” he added while speaking to analysts in the third quarter earnings call on January 18.On December 2, the bank issued a statement saying that some of its customers were facing ‘intermittent issues’ while accessing the NetBanking and MobileBanking app.“We apologise that the resolution of the technical glitch is taking more time than anticipated,” HDFC Bank said on its social media account.However, this is not the first time that the lender has faced issues in mobile banking. In December 2018, the bank’s new mobile banking app went down and the outage lasted for a week causing inconvenience to customers. This happened while the lender was in the process of upgrading the app.“It is taking us longer than anticipated, but we are confident we’ll be able to fix the issue at the earliest and you’ll be able to use the new app,” the bank said.With rising awareness and improving payments infrastructure, a large number of transactions are carried out through mobile and internet banking in India.To get a perspective, the country witnessed transactions close to Rs 5 trillion via mobile and Rs 22 trillion through internet banking channels in November, according to the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India.HDFC Bank has a customer base of more than 49 million and over 90 percent of its retail transactions are initiated via internet and mobile."

We don't know the conditions. We have no information whether PSUs are allowed to bid or not,"" Singh told reporters here. ""I cannot comment if IOC will bid or not unless we see the conditions set out in the EoI.""He said a decision on the issue can only be taken once there is clarity on the bidding process the government intends to follow.Soon after the Cabinet decision, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had hinted that PSUs will be kept out of BPCL privatisation.""Since 2014, we have a clear vision that the government has no business to be in business,"" Pradhan had said on November 22, 2019. ""We have examples of 2-3 sectors such as telecom and aviation where ushering in private participation has led to customers benefiting from price cuts, efficiency, and better service.""Asked if the company has been told that PSUs will be kept out, Singh said there is no information on whether state-owned firms can bid or not.BPCL will give the buyer ready access to 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and about one-fourth of the fuel marketing infrastructure in the world's fastest-growing energy market.It, however, will be sold after carving out Numaligarh Refinery from its portfolio and given to a pubic sector unit. Numaligarh Refinery Ltd is also to be sold out to a PSU, possibly through a bidding process.Singh said he cannot comment if the company will bid for the Numaligarh Refinery unless tender conditions are revealed.""We don't know if Numaligarh Refinery will be sold with marketing infrastructure or without its marketing infrastructure. We have to wait for details before IOC can take any decision,"" he said.Numaligarh refinery was set up as per the Assam Peace Accord and the government has decided to keep it in the public sector.At the current trading price of BPCL, the government's 53.29 per cent stake is valued at around Rs 53,400 crore. On top of this, the acquirer will have to make an open offer to buy an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders for about Rs 26,000 crore.The price of BPCL has been hammered since the November 21 CCEA decision. On that day, the government stood to gain Rs 62,000 crore from privatisation but will now get about Rs 8,000 crore less.The stake sales are critical for the government to meet its disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore set for the current financial year.The government had allowed PSUs to bid when it sold petro retailer IBP Co Ltd in 2002. IOC had bagged the government's 33 per cent stake in IBP for Rs 1,153.68 crore or Rs 1,551 a share.The other bidders for IBP were Reliance Industries, Royal Dutch Shell, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, BPCL, and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. The reserve price for IBP was Rs 337 crore.Last year, the government sold its entire stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for Rs 36,915 crore.BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes.After removing 3 million tonnes capacity of Numaligarh refinery, the new buyer will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants. The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.The government is keen to get international energy majors such as Saudi Aramco, Total SA of France and ExxonMobil to operate in the downstream fuel marketing business so as to bring in greater competition.Currently, 95 per cent of retail petrol and diesel sales and near 100 per cent of cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene sales are controlled by the public sector units."

datetime,2020-01-18 17:03:00+00:00
description,Here is a complete round-up of the big news from the auto sector this week
content,"Bajaj finally made the Chetak available again but at a price some would feel is out of reach of many. The original 1970s Chetak commanded a super premium in the black market thanks to the ten year waiting period but the current generation battery electric Chetak comes priced at a premium over the premium. But how well does it fare when it comes to practicality of everyday use? In this edition of the news wrap we compare the Chetak against the largest-selling scooter of India. But here is a complete round-up of all the big automotive news of the week.Bajaj Chetak launched at Rs 1 lakhNoneChetak is the first of many electric models planned by Bajaj Auto, including that under partner KTM and Husqvarna brands. Deliveries of the Chetak with six colour and two variants will commence from February-endOverregulation is killing the auto industry: Rajiv BajajNoneHonda launches Activa 6G at Rs 64,000NoneActiva, which is already the largest selling two wheeler brand in India, with sales of over 200,000 every month, will be available in two variants. The delux variant is priced at Rs 65,412.Audi launches Q8 SUV at Rs 1.33 croreNoneThe Q8 gets a prominent trapezoidal grille with Matrix LED headlamps. It gets dual-tone alloys with a connected tail lamp, raked tailgate, an aggressive splitter and dual exhausts. It also gets a coupe-like stance due to its sloping roofline and a sporty side profile.Honda to start testing EV in India this yearNoneThe Japanese giant is the only scooter and motorcycle making company that was yet to firm up plans about electric scooters or electric bikes even as its rivals have been discussing launch plans of such vehicles.Honda to axe 4-5 modelsNoneHonda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), the country’s second-largest two-wheeler maker, will stop production of BS-IV compliant scooters and motorcycles by the end of January, a top company official confirmed.Auto Expo 2020: New launches to light up the eventNoneWith around 600,000 footfalls expected during the eight-day extravaganza, the Expo will see the participation of nearly half a dozen Chinese-headquartered companies and around 18 start-ups.Bajaj Chetak vs Honda ActivaWhile the real world riding experience of the Chetak is yet to be enjoyed since the vehicle will start getting delivered to its customers in early February the following comparison is based purely on the cost of ownership against the Honda Activa, India’s largest-selling two-wheeler.For a single charge the Rs 100,000 (ex-showroom, Delhi) Chetak can run for a maximum of 95 kms. Bajaj Auto has revealed this figure after having tested the Chetak in real riding conditions. Under standard test condition as done by the Automotive Research Association of India the mileage figures came in much higher.In the sport mode (to keep up with the city traffic on highways) the Chetak’s mileage drops to 85 kms. It will take 5-6 hours to fully charge the vehicle consuming 4-5 units of electricity. With each unit costing Rs 5-6 the running cost of Chetak per kilometer comes to Rs 0.3.The 110cc engine-powered Activa 6G with a Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) engine is priced at Rs 63,912 (ex-showroom Delhi). With a 5.3 litre fuel tank the Activa can run for 250-300 kms on a full tank considering the Activa has a real world mileage of 47-56 km per litre. With price of petrol hitting Rs 81 per litre the average running cost of the Activa comes to Rs 1.4 to 1.72 per kilometer. If mileage dips then the running cost climbs higher.Advantages of ChetakThe Chetak has a running cost that is one fifth of the Activa. With so little moving parts the Chetak has negligible service cost. Besides being environment friendly the Chetak is also much quieter to run than the petrol powered two-wheeler. There is no need for an oil change while the brake pad maintenance required is very less.Bajaj has provided connectivity features on the Chetak. Data communication, security and user authentication will enable owners to have a seamless ownership and riding experience. A mobile app will provide a comprehensive overview of all aspects of the vehicle including ride history and real time location of the vehicle.Advantage of ActivaThe Activa is 56 percent cheaper than the Chetak in the initial buying cost. With zero need for any charging the Activa is fill-n-forget. Refilling at the petrol pump can take a maximum of 10 minutes."

On January 15, 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a notification asking all the banks to enhance the security features of debit and credit card transactions. Some common queries regarding this transition are addressed here.Q: What are the new security features added for domestic and international transactions?NoneOften, consumers have concerns relating to the misuse of cards.

By setting the transaction limit, the consumer can now limit the use to certain expenses and monitor the usage of the card periodically. Also, other features make the cards more secure for consumers.Q: My card allows international transaction, but I’m not flying abroad anytime soon. Can I turn off my international spend feature temporarily to avoid mis-use? NoneBanks need to provide the facility to switch on and off various features on your cards, on a 24 x 7 basis through multiple channels –mobile application, internet banking, automated teller machine (the bank’s own ATM) and interactive voice response (IVR). A consumer can also avail of this facility by visiting the bank’s branch.Q: Can I still continue to use my existing credit and debit cards? NoneQ: I have just applied for a new card.

description,"While a million dollars may seem like a substantially large amount, it pales in comparison to the cost an automaker would have to bear in the wake of a major security flaw in one of its vehicles."
content,"Tesla has been heavily investing in cybersecurity over the last couple of years. The electric automaker recently turned to Pwn2Own, a hacking competition held in Vancouver and run by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). Tesla is challenging white hat hackers to breach the systems on the best-selling car in its fleet, the Model 3.As a reward for hacking into the car, Tesla is offering over $1 million dollars in cash and other prizes, including a brand-new Model 3. ZDI confirmed that Tesla would be a big-name sponsor for the event’s automotive category. These challenges are not uncommon among automakers and other manufacturers.While a million dollars may seem like a substantially large amount, it pales in comparison to the cost an automaker would have to bear in the wake of a major security flaw in one of its vehicles. Such hacking challenges with friendly white hat hackers enable a company to put the security system on its cars to the test, which is becoming ever-so-important as automobiles become more reliant on computer systems. Beyond identifying potential threats, a competition like this will allow Tesla to address areas in the system that may be improved.Tesla and Trend Micro will hand out cash up to $500,000 and Model 3 cars to individuals who can crack the top layer of security, which entails completely compromising the systems on a Model 3. Additionally, a contestant ticking off a few hacks in extra categories will earn up to $200,000 over the half a million dollars.The second tier of prizes will earn hackers a maximum of half a million dollars by challenging them to compromise the car’s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or infotainment. The rewards are divided into different tiers, depending on the level of difficulty of the hack,"
